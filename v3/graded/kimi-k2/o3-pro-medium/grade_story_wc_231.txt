<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Oswald’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “softly persistent curiosity” drives every micro-choice. The borrowed-memory conceit externalizes his loneliness without therapy-speak, and pinning the Edelweise to mimic a stranger’s heartbeat is a precise, costly gesture. The final bow acknowledges burden and privilege, earning the Earned Stasis closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Oswald’s acceptance of custodianship reweights isolation into guardianship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory gap intensifies until the ampoule’s discovery crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the final “fresh gap newly born,” where the lover’s laugh now haunts Oswald’s solitude.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse glass are not backdrop but instruments: the dock planks conceal the ampoule, the mist muffles sound to create “gaps,” the rotating lens aligns with Deneb to charge the memory. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—thin alpine air versus salt burn—anchoring orientation early.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the gesture and safeguard the memory—tightens through each gap Oswald parses. The ampoule’s discovery is a deepening that reweights his role from watcher to keeper. Cost is the perpetual echo of another’s joy now lodged in his solitude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of isolation as stewardship emerges through concrete particulars: the lighthouse beam that “crosses without touching,” the ampoule aligned with a distant star. No moralizing; the final image of the beam sweeping the sea offers a non-literal answer—witnessed isolation is never final.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature attuned to maritime acoustics and alpine altitude. Patterned elision (“gaps between gull calls”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Syntax mirrors Oswald’s spiral ascent; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “mist curled around his ankles the way cats request company without admitting need.” No loops, no mixed metaphors. Each sentence layers atmosphere, character, and forward motion; the final paragraph’s cadence slows to crystallize the Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The memory-as-object premise is fresh, yet grounded in tactile detail—glass ampoule smaller than a raindrop. Transformation test: swap alpine Edelweiss for any generic flower and the emotional circuitry collapses. Risky lyric structure pays off in a closure that feels inevitable yet unforeseen.</comment>
