<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sera’s patience and seed-collector identity are embodied in tactile choices—tracing knots, trading seeds, cradling fulgurite—yet interior contradiction is muted; the “promise to sow when the world is ready” is more emblematic than agonizing. Secondary pressure from the fisherman is slight but sufficient to trigger the quest. Cost is felt in the pledge that “tiny roots gripped my ribs,” an earned stasis rather than change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cradle of possibility redefines the weavers from guardians to instructors, with the conceptual cost of indefinite guardianship. Causal chain—rope message → lightning site → cradle → vow—holds cleanly under a Causal lens. Orientation is swift; no drift or teleportation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Golden dock under snow, glass-warm sand, and vitrified tubes are vivid, selective, and constrain movement and meaning; the fulgurite itself becomes the charged micro-setting that guides the final image. Spatial choreography is clear; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve ancient methods—tightens when the rope message narrows options to one perilous site; the lightning strike is coincidence that complicates, not rescues. Agency is exercised in the vow to guard the seed, with the cost of perpetual deferral legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of patience as active stewardship emerges through image and action, culminating in the cradle of possibility that reframes preservation as co-creation with storms. No moralizing; resonance is carried by the final hush.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric, oceanic cadence is consistent and voice-driven; perceptual signature (“gulls stitched pale circles”) is character-specific. Compression and elision (“infinitely patient”) are taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue with the fisherman is spare yet idiosyncratic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, each sentence layering image, motion, and stakes; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise (“foghorn in miniature”) and never muddle causality. Final cadence crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of knot-speech, lightning-forged relics, and secret weavers as storm-looms feels fresh yet inevitable. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in the reconfigured closure. No close echoes or gimmicks.</comment>
