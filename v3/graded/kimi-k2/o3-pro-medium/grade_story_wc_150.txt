<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; exile’s ache is shown through tactile micro-choices (brushing moss, fitting the peg). The final renunciation—staying to tend stories—carries visible cost (foregoing departure) and is seeded early. Minor slip: “cautious enchantment” repeats as label rather than evolving.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the rebuilt sundial reweights the premise, casting a shadow that points the living toward home. Causal chain holds—each descent step because/therefore narrows options until the peg fits and the orchard answers. Cost is legible in the unfinished groove and the speaker’s resolve to stay.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Catacomb orchard is rendered through smell of fermenting figs, roots like polished antlers, skulls smirking—details that constrain movement and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the sundial base’s cracked socket anchors both geography and theme. One minor drift: “autumn leaves” in dry season jars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restoring interrupted faith—is signaled early and tightened when the groove of the unfinished return path mirrors the hollow in the chest. Escalation is causal: each discovery (crack, stairwell, etchings) raises the cost of leaving until the peg’s insertion forecloses departure. Price is felt in the sprouting seed of trust that forgives burial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of exile and return emerges from etched ships and unfinished grooves, never sermonized. Final image—sunbeam on the orchard—offers non-literal answer: faith is rebuilt not by arrival but by tending what was buried. Subtext in Taklo’s whisper and the smirking skulls deepens ambiguity without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in sensory specificity; “fruit fall like muted bells” teaches the orchard’s cadence early. Compression and elision (“I did not speak; wonder required silence”) are purposeful and paid off in the final psalm-like ascent. No head-hopping; POV remains intimate and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (roots like polished antlers, faith sprouting like a seed) are precise and earned. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during descent, longer breaths at revelation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar diaspora-return trope through the orchard-crypt and the sundial’s missing arm; the iron tent peg as gnomon is fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring causality. Specificity of etchings and fermenting figs anchors universals in lived detail.</comment>
