<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied ("metallic bees," "feral nostalgia"), but the causal link between jealousy and the final revision is asserted rather than dramatized; the paper-plane beat is poetic yet feels like a shortcut rather than a micro-choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator rewrites the storm’s purpose, foreclosing the grave timeline. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers density until the charcoal draft reweights meaning. Cost is felt in the “adequately footnoted” half-life the narrator accepts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The cabin, stove, and scroll function as micro-setting that constrains action: the stove’s knots become maps, the scroll rewrites itself mid-air, and the charcoal is the only writing tool left. Weather and altitude affect stamina and choice. Spatial anchors are clear; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent the mindscape avalanche—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when the scroll’s paradox forces the narrator to choose revision over surrender. The cost is the erasure of the rookie’s ascent and the narrator’s own temporal exile, visible in the dissolving grave date.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the cost of narrative control: rewriting prophecy consumes the self that believed in it. The final image of estranged past/present drafts glaring at each other offers a non-literal answer—chronicle as self-erasure—without moralizing.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent under pressure: “jaded wonder…thin and itchy like ranger-issue wool.” Patterned elision (“chronology had abandoned me”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No POV drift; perceptual signature remains sharp.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor scaffold in “feral nostalgia” repetition is offset by fresh turns like “snowmelt whispered.” No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final lightning silhouette is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—dream chronicler editing reality—feels fresh, grounded in tactile detail. The transformation of jealousy into solvent is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky nonlinear structure pays off in the charcoal revision beat. No close echoes; voice is singular.</comment>
