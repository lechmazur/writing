<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—obsession vs. survival—are embodied in her soggy resolve to open the trapdoor; the final choice costs her the building’s silence and her exile from performance, earned by prior causality. Interiority is specific, e.g., “water quivered like skin under sound.” No relationship crucible on page, so relationship bullets waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the trapdoor act reweights the hall’s acoustics and Mira’s exile into communion with Silvestri. Causal chain—blot-score → harmonic → trapdoor → mosaic—holds under Causal lens with visible cost: the opera house is now irreversibly altered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Flooded pit, lanterns, and mother-of-pearl mosaics constrain every move; the rising water literally limits footing and dictates the final acoustic shift. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira’s musician ear, e.g., “wood settling into new unpredictable acoustics.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode Silvestri’s silence—tightens when Mira must choose between preserving the hall and unleashing the hidden score. The trapdoor act narrows options irreversibly; cost is the building’s further ruin and her own exile crystallized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of music as living echo emerges from the concrete act of flooding the pit; no moralizing. Final credo “play, and you reside beside me” reweights the premise without explicit statement, offering resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure: “lantern stuttering his silhouette.” No dialogue; POV remains stable and perceptually specific to a violist’s ear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“spectral inkblots” → “spectral ink”). No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Flooded opera house as drowned cathedral, blot-score as ghost language—specific synthesis that feels inevitable. Risky structural choice (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
