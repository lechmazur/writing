<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lysandra is vivid—her vocation informs every beat, her motives tethered to the literal work of tuning buildings. The interior contradiction (empathy vs. cost of theft) is dramatized in the theft decision, not merely stated. Emotional cost is embodied as physical fatigue leaning against warm timber; no stock labels or diagnostic talk. Relationship with the elevator is treated as a living duet, fulfilling the crucible test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the valley’s dawn harmony reweights the premise after Lysandra trades a minor bell for a restored grain singer. The “borrowed starlight” payoff reconfigures cost with daylight’s re-collection. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each multilingual exchange adds density until resonance becomes architecture. Causality holds: she acts therefore structures respond therefore valley hears.</comment>

<comment>The astronomical clock tower is not postcard décor; its bronze sighs and missing weight exert causal pressure that drives Lysandra to steal (constrains choice) and charges the final syncopation in her absence. Grain elevator’s splintered ribs under moonlight embody both rot and instrumentality. Sensory economy filters every detail through her tuner’s ear (wind carries syllables, planks pulse like bass drums).</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear from first paragraph: bridge structures into symphonies before dawn repossesses the loaned light. One escalating loop—exercise, retune, harmonize—adds density until the final fifth locks valley-wide. Cost is visible on the page: missing bell compromises tower; Lysandra stands exhausted against elevator while birds carry the chord away (felt absence).</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges as architecture-as-community: buildings ache for accompaniment just as people do. No explicit thesis; the realization lands in the invisible bridge of sound reweighting isolation-as-chance-to-answer. Subtext pulses in the stolen counterweight—ethical theft acknowledged only obliquely. Ending image of birds dispersing polyglot notes resists moralizing and invites further listening.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in synesthetic specificity ("brass lung," "trembling syllables"). Patterned diction teaches its own syntax early and stays legible to close. Rhythm modulates with muscular urgency while remaining coherent. Compression is purposeful: "She sprinted back... two at a time, lantern swinging" gives speed without clutter. No head-hopping; everything filtered through choral librarian’s perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense but never overwrought: every phrase serves character or resonance. Metaphors stay internally coherent (elevator’s boards as ribs, tower’s brass orreries as planets). Minor filter verbs (<3 total) do not dull immediacy. Only one paraphrase-loop late ("grain once divided" vs earlier "grain without"), minimal impact. Final sentence cadence crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade><comment>Widely familiar prompt scaffold elevated: musical architecture of abandoned agrarian silos given choral treatment. Multilingual decay sung as harmony is non-obvious synthesis. Risky premise could collapse into whimsical gimmickry, but execution grounds it in tactile labor and audible cost. Specificity of stolen weight, splinter boards, and valley dawn carries the concept safely across.</comment>
