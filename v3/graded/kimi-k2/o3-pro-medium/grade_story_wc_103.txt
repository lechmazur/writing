<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quillon’s interior contradiction—yearning to fix time yet recoiling from the cost—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation is earned by the garden’s tightening ivy and the sync of his heartbeat with the hollow clock, a visible bodily cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Quillon becomes the living axis, foreclosing escape. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the final chord reweights all prior images with irrevocable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The living bridge actively resists and reshapes Quillon’s path; its hyperbolic corridors literally devour distance, constraining his tactics and charging the final image where ivy binds his ankles—setting as antagonist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve or lose the texture of time—tightens once when the halo fragment demands a keeper. Agency crystallizes in the single irrevocable choice to stay; the cost is his permanent exile into stasis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: the price of fixing memory is eternal self-erasure. The final image of the boy merging with the gardener reweights every prior photograph without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet precise, modulating from tremulous awe to resigned clarity; perceptual signature filters every detail through Quillon’s designer eye and chronopathic ear, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each metaphor (origami rain, breathing spine) advances texture or stakes. No loops or mixed metaphors; rhythm accelerates under pressure then settles into the final cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>A fresh synthesis: hedge-maze logic meets non-Euclidean time-garden. The retrocognitive designer becoming the maze’s living axis feels inevitable yet non-obvious, the risk pays off in coherence and resonance.</comment>
