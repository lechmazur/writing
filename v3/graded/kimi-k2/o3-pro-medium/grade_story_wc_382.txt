<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrator’s obsession with masonry-language is embodied through concrete micro-choices (renting the attic, pressing the seal into rainwater). Selin’s translucent flicker and Mrs. Polina’s tearful confession give on-page cost to their shared guilt. The final promise to carry the lessons elsewhere is earned by prior intimacy and betrayal. Interiority remains specific, though the late murder revelation feels slightly compressed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator accepts custodianship of an unfinished lesson, sealing the promise with the cracked seal in rainwater—visible cost. Causal chain holds: meteor shower → rooftop lessons → broken seal → dissolution → bequest. Orientation is immediate; transitions are clean. The lens is causal with accumulative texture; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rooftop garden, attic flat, and brass seal are tactile micro-settings that constrain action (meteors overhead, squeaking walls, seal pressed into wax). Sensory hierarchy favors sound and touch—phonemes in bricks, gutters clanging—filtered through the narrator’s architectural ear. The seal’s verdigris and cracked brass charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: master the language before human alphabets rot. Escalation tightens when the seal cracks and Selin dissolves, foreclosing her guidance and forcing the narrator to shoulder the burden. Agency is present in the final acceptance; cost is the loss of tutor and the moral weight of Polina’s guilt. Pressure coheres under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of “agreed-upon lies” emerges through action: polite fictions of sugar/tea, the First Lie seal, the unspoken murder. Subtext operates in Polina’s tears and Selin’s translucent nod. The ending reframes the rooftop garden as a penance chapel without moralizing. Resonance lingers in the scattered letters threading toward unseen roofs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is architecturally synesthetic—silver syllables, brick consonants, gutteral limestone vowels—sustained without purple drift. POV remains first-person singular, no head-hop. Compression (“Death merely freed her schedule”) is taught early and paid off. Dialogue is minimal yet distinct; Selin’s waterlogged diction contrasts with Polina’s terse lantern-lit whisper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive; each line layers sensory and conceptual freight. Metaphors (meteor grammar, chrysanthemum pronunciation) are fresh and coherent. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction is voice-motivated. Final image of fractured letters rising through meteor dark is crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—learning the secret grammar of buildings from a ghost tutor—feels inevitable yet non-obvious. The First Lie seal, meteor shower, and rooftop penance garden synthesize into a singular vision. Risky elements (ghost, cuneiform, murder confession) are grounded in sensory specificity. The transformation test passes: story would collapse if any element were swapped.</comment>
