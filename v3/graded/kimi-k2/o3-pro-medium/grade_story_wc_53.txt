<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlo’s regret and scavenger identity are embodied in every beat—pocketing voices, trading memories for direction—culminating in the ghost’s cavity-filling choice that visibly costs him his hoarded stories. Interior contradiction (regret vs. need to move) stays active in scene. Minor slip: “chronologically confused” is asserted more than enacted until the lily-pad memory loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stolen fragment layers density until the camera wheel reconfigures the sky and the ghost’s offer crystallizes choice. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Marlo’s stance shifts from theft to stewardship—paid for by surrendering every pilfered sound. No causality breaks; the carousel restart is earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon, revolving lily pads, and carousel-horse pier are not backdrop; they erase memory, dictate footing, and finally re-animate to launch Marlo. Micro-setting (camera wheel gauze) charges the closure image. Sensory selection stays urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—direction versus erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the ghost demands a heart-filling price. The final surrender of stories forecloses the scavenger tactic with visible cost. One clear escalation beat suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of story-as-currency emerges from concrete action: fragments traded for passage, regret converted into motion. No moralizing; the carousel’s restart offers a non-literal answer—keep moving if you carry, not steal. Final image reweights every earlier theft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and consistent—compressed diction under pressure (“hands trembling with the magnitude of unprinted futures”). Perceptual signature is scavenger-poet: noticing gull-like stories, cataloguing regrets. No POV drift; experimental elision is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful (“yarn of tellers untangles into directions”). No loops or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with scene tension; final cadence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—regret-negotiation with a ghost via stolen voices above a time-fractured lagoon—is fresh and fully committed. Tropes (ghostly bargain, carousel) are transformed through scavenger logic and story-currency. Risky structure pays off in inevitable hindsight.</comment>
