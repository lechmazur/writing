<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silas’s insomnia-turned-vigilance is embodied in micro-choices (checking hatches, coaxing engines) and crystallizes in the final renunciation of sleep for listening; the contradiction between exhaustion and duty is palpable. Lira functions as catalyst rather than crucible, so relationship pressure is light, yet Silas’s internal stakes and cost feel earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (glowing dune, ticking clock, subterranean algae) thickens until the final Charged Poise reweights wakefulness as generative soil. Closure—“vigilance sometimes means guarding beginnings”—lands with conceptual cost and no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Bioluminescent grains, frozen clock, and geothermal caverns are filtered through Silas’s guard-eye; each detail constrains movement and later charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, and the salt flats–cavern descent tracks without drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping dream-seeds alive—tightens when the clock’s midnight stasis becomes the necessary soil; Silas’s choice to listen instead of sleep incurs the cost of perpetual wakefulness. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, fitting the length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of caretaking wakefulness emerges through image (frozen midnight as fertile pause) rather than statement; the lullaby motif fractures then mends in the final beat, reweighting insomnia from curse to vocation. No moralizing, only resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with guard-sensory diction (“checked the cargo hatches for leaks of heat or hope”). Rhythm modulates under pressure—short percussive clauses when descending, longer lullaby cadences in cavern. No POV slippage; every metaphor is POV-earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Occasional lyric height (“petals of light,” “subsong”) is balanced by concrete action. No loops or mixed metaphors; clarity remains even at peak intensity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: insomnia as seedbed, chess-clock midnight as compass-soil, archive shards as civilizational embryos. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final reconfiguration. No derivative echoes; the speculative ecology feels singular.</comment>
