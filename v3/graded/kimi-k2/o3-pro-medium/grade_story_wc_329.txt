<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elaine’s interiority is embodied through tactile violin work and pulse-listening; her contradictory fear and resolve surface in the moment she flings the locust shell. Lio’s presence is thin but sufficient to create relational pressure. The final stance—beauty decided, not displayed—carries earned cost. Minor: we never feel Lio’s flaws complicate his choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard’s shift from oil to sap reconfigures the world’s rule-set with undeniable conceptual cost (“the kingdom would brand her traitor tomorrow”). Causality holds under a Hybrid lens; each musical phrase tightens the statues’ lock until the final resonance breaks them. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sky-bridge cables, living statues, and brass-leaf orchard constrain every move; the locust shell micro-setting charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Elaine notices dew-fragile notes, not tourist vistas. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible statue positions. One slip: “clockwork order” is slightly expository.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawaken beauty or accept mechanical silence—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened when the statues’ joints lock. Agency is musical; each bow-stroke raises the cost of rebellion. The price—traitor branding and uprooted gearbox—lands on the page. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of sap replacing oil; no moralizing statement intrudes. The locust shell’s final crack reweights the entire premise without a thesis sentence. Subtext pulses in shared heartbeats and marble shrieks. Final image—“beginnings are always born in tarnished wonder”—earns resonance through prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “resonantly soft note that only twilight could reveal” teaches the pattern early. Syntax mirrors tension—long breaths for wonder, staccato for lock-step statues. No head-hopping; Lio’s perception arrives only through Elaine’s sensing. One near-miss: “tarnished wonder” is repeated, but the cadence justifies it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and causal work. Metaphors stay coherent—“bridge moaned...as a cathedral does”—without purple drift. No loops or scaffold; “resonantly soft” returns with earned weight. Minor: “policed by living statues” could trim one modifier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of violin-magic, living statues, and clockwork orchard feels inevitable yet fresh. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final sap-image. No derivative templates; the locust-shell payoff grows organically from larval metaphor. Bold choice to keep Lio off-page yet emotionally present heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
