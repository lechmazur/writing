<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ila’s trembling gloves and hairline crack in the frozen pane embody her contradictory impulses in scene; the micro-choice to encrypt the letter inside weather data is earned by prior interior conflict and carries visible cost (lost sterility, shared danger with Malvek). The final shared vigil on the crate crystallizes a relationship shift under pressure. Missing 9+ only because Malvek’s late entry slightly dilutes the crucible focus.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: contraband letter → alcove breach → buoy transmission → Curator confrontation → co-vigil, each beat narrowing options and raising cost. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the path of sterile obedience is foreclosed by the on-page reply “We hear you” and the shared risk of waiting. One hairline slip: Malvek’s sister backstory is told, not dramatized, but it doesn’t break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Library’s breathing corridors, frost-bitten shelves, and camera-blind Alcove Seven actively constrain Ila’s choices; the carbon case and cracked pane function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Weather-buoy network is sketched with tactile specificity (capacitor solvent, green text complaining). Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV priorities: archival chill > auditory echoes > visual glare. Environment shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether a contraband truth will thaw or remain frozen—tightens at each beat: incineration protocol vs. broadcast risk. The decisive turn (queuing the transmission) forecloses sterile safety and triggers the Curator’s confrontation, raising tangible cost. Pressure escalates under causal lens; coincidence is absent. Cost is visible: shared vigil beneath pewter glow, awaiting unknown replies.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—archive as both prison and conduit for suppressed history—emerges through concrete events: the warm letter in a cryogenic vault, telemetry packets masquerading as wind speed. Final image of the Library “breathing back” reweights earlier “dizzying quiet” without moralizing. Subtext in Malvek’s wet eyes and shared crate-sitting implies generational regret and tentative redemption. Ambiguity lingers: will ice melt or refreeze harder?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Ila’s perceptual signature: “ink blossoming into voices she could almost hear,” “arguments like cold shards.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, compresses during clandestine upload. No head-hopping; Malvek’s interior accessed only via external cues (wet eyes, whisper). Distinctive diction avoids generic lyricism; purposeful elision (“code ruts”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “snow hushed the buried citadel” opens with sonic and tactile immediacy. Mixed metaphors are avoided; vehicles stay coherent (library as lung, buoy as gull). One minor scaffold: “dizzying quiet” is repeated without fresh inflection late. Otherwise rhythm varies, sentences carry double duty, and no filter-verb clusters dull the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Frozen archive smuggling rebellion via weather telemetry feels fresh; trope of dystopian librarian is reanimated through cryogenic sterility and buoy-network resurrection. Specificity—carbon case, capacitor solvent, pewter glow—grounds the concept so it couldn’t swap settings without collapse. Final “world shifts” reprises the latency motif, turning tech detail into thematic resonance. Risk in quiet broadcast pays off.</comment>
