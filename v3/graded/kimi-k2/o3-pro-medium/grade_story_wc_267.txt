<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ellis’s vow to “decipher the fortress’s quiet covenant” and his final micro-choice—twisting the bolt—are embodied and costly, yet interiority occasionally drifts into abstract “frostbitten hope” rather than concrete contradiction. The silent-choir conceit is vivid but never tested under pressure; his muteness feels ornamental, not crucible-forged. Still, the renunciation of silence lands with felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fortress’s hush “felt less cruel, like a vow freely chosen.” Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density of silence accumulates until the single decisive act reweights the rule-set. Cost is legible in the line “storms might come tomorrow.” Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, icicles on violins, and the piano lid sealed by a single screw all constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“vents exhaled the distant scent of axle grease”). Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cost of safety versus sound—is signaled in the second paragraph and tightened when Ellis weighs “duty against that frostbitten hope.” One meaningful turn: twisting the bolt forecloses the fortress’s absolute silence. Cost is visible in the deeper hush that follows.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: safety need not imprison sound, only teach it to listen. Subtext lives in gesture—Mara’s hovering hand, Ellis leaning against the pew—never in sermon. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature (“flames bent like knees in prayer”). Patterned elision—no spoken dialogue—is taught early and paid off at closure. Syntax modulates with pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is selective and purposeful; “memory of one, a breath before the first note” crystallizes the climax without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of silent-choir bellhop, nerve-regeneration ward, and piano-bolt quest feels inevitable and fresh. Tropes are inverted: silence as both shield and prison. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
