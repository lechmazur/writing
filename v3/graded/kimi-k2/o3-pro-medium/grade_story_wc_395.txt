<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyra’s curiosity is embodied through tactile micro-choices—glowing gloves, threading the patch, rerouting cooling—yet her interiority occasionally drifts into abstract “sensed absence” labels rather than embodied contradiction. The final renunciation (broadcasting the breach) carries visible cost (legal teams storming in), earning the closure. Minor deduction for stock phrases like “brightly attentive gaze.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat follows because/therefore logic from patch-as-key to server overload. Closure lands as Decisive Change—Lyra triggers mass liberation with undeniable cost (archive buckling, agents closing in). One micro-turn (lie to daemon) is cleanly motivated. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The archive’s flickering shelves and “voided columns” constrain Lyra’s stealth tactics; the patch’s physical port anchors spatial logic. Sensory selection narrows under pressure—hum, glow, frost—mirroring internal stakes. One minor slip: “dark stacks” remains slightly generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover deleted consciousness—tightens when corporate red warnings foreclose safe restoration. Escalation is causal: each lie narrows Lyra’s options until the final broadcast. Cost is visible in server thunder and legal sprint. Slight deduction for off-stage outrage ignition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. corporate erasure emerges through action (patch unlock, server flood) rather than statement. Final image—astronauts singing themselves home—reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “whatever punishment awaited her.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lyra’s corporate-technical diction (“metadata optimization tests”) collides with lyrical fragments (“echo of forgotten songs”). Rhythm modulates under pressure—short bursts during breach, longer cadences in reflection. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density: single sentences layer sensory, emotional, and technical data (“gloves glowed as she lifted…”). Metaphors are precise (“frost on glass”). One minor loop: “sensed absence” appears twice without new charge. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cold-case astronauts as trapped metadata, numbers as breadcrumb code. Premise commits fully; no retreat into generic cyber-thriller. Risky structural compression (lyric montage of server flood) pays off in resonant final image. Transformation test passed.</comment>
