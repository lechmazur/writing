<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hai-rin’s interiority is specific—water lattices, moon bridges, net metaphors—yet the final choice to gather the net without drinking the tea crystallizes his value hierarchy with felt cost. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. modesty) play out in micro-gestures. Secondary pressure from Zhen is light but present. The earned renunciation (not drinking) is small yet legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the moon’s path is newly legible, the fishermen’s hidden effort is surfaced, and Hai-rin’s stance crystallizes. Causal chain—whistle summons, net mirrors, moon writes glyphs—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is the un-drunk tea and the sailors’ unseen strain. Orientation is anchored by parapet, courtyard, harbor within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Parapet’s post-rain gloss, firefly constellations, and moonlit net create tactile specificity that constrains action (slick stone slows descent, net must stay still). Micro-setting (tea steam catching firefly light) charges Zhen’s face and the final mirror. Spatial choreography from keep to courtyard to tidewall is clean. Weather and season are not backdrop but active collaborators.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can the hidden pattern be made visible without disturbing it? Escalation is one deepening: moon’s drift → need undisturbed mirror → collective stillness. Agency is shared yet centered on Hai-rin’s orchestration. Cost is the sailors’ muscle burn and Hai-rin’s relinquished refreshment. Coincidence (moon’s exact touch) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the ethics of noticing unseen labor, the reciprocity between sky and water, the humility of pattern-seeking. Subtext in the un-drunk cup and the unspoken strain of fishermen. Final image reframes earlier motifs—nets, moon, effort—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: who truly holds the universe together?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with a philosopher-net-mender’s perceptual signature: “transient veins,” “sequined threads.” Rhythm modulates from hushed parapet to harbor hush. Dialogue is spare, subtext-rich (“I traced the route…”). No head-hopping; focalization stays with Hai-rin. Compression (“moonset approached”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “scintillatingly somber radiance” risks excess but earns its place through Zhen’s paradox. No loops or scaffold. Sentence variety mirrors emotional tide. Metaphors are coherent (moon as shy dancer, net as skin). Opening and closing lines are image-anchored and propulsive. Minor alliteration is purposeful, not ornamental.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a Taoist fable recast as artisanal astronomy. Moon-maiden folklore, net-mending philosophy, and firefly ephemerality interlock organically. Risky lyricism pays off in the mirrored glyphs. The story could not survive relocation; its specificity is its engine. No derivative echoes; the angle feels inevitable only in hindsight.</comment>
