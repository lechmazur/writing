<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lysander’s interiority is vivid—scars as “ports,” sap tracing “constellations”—and his spiral self-wounding is a credible, embodied cost. Motive (“renegotiate dreams”) is stated abstractly but dramatized through the blood-sap exchange. The final step along the newborn path crystallizes a stance with felt consequence. One notch below 9.0 because the covenant backstory is delivered in summary rather than lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the maze becomes a spiral, dreamers awaken, covenant re-lit. Causal chain—question → spiral cut → mirrored hedges—holds cleanly. Cost is visible in the fresh scars that seal into “faint white lines.” Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The cobalt glade’s “blue glow of dateless twilight” is more than postcard; its air density and root grip physically steady Lysander after the cut. Micro-setting (his own scarred skin) constrains the redesign. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Falls just short of 9.0 because the arboretum remains off-stage and thus less integrated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—honor the covenant or perpetuate soul-trapping—is signaled early and tightened when Lysander must wound himself to rewrite the maze. Escalation is causal: each throb of the spiral on his arm tightens the stakes for unseen dreamers. Cost is immediate and on-page. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Theme of reciprocal obligation between human and vegetal emerges through action, not statement. The final image—spiral path glowing ahead—offers a non-literal answer to “how may we unweave the maze.” Subtext in the roots’ “hymn without words” deepens resonance. Avoids tidy moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “petrichor and tungsten-tinged light,” “chlorophyll filaments that pulsed like tiny lanterns.” Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hop. Compression and elision (“the future arrives early”) are taught early and paid off. Rhythm modulates with pressure, culminating in the hush before the spiral blooms.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image, stakes, or motion. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—blood and sap, scars and paths—and serve causality. One minor register lift (“conceptual repricing” risk) but does not intrude on closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Fusing botanical horror with covenantal myth feels fresh; the maze-into-spiral renegotiation is an earned inversion. Specificity of “green question mark” clipping and “cobalt glade” anchors the fantastical. Risky self-wounding as design tool pays off without gimmickry. Synthesis is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
