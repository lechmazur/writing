<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kes’s interiority is vivid—his “mindfully scattered” plan and the bottled moonlight inheritance anchor motive. The final renunciation (leaving the slate blank) is earned by prior beats and carries visible cost: he forfeits profit and the orchard’s coordinates dissolve. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blank slate reweights the premise, making absence the first letter. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each moonlit apple adds density until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in the parole’s expiry and Kes’s relinquished commerce.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glass orchard is more than postcard: the ladders of braided prism and sap-glass apples constrain movement and supply the moonlit fruit that drives the plot. Micro-setting (the atrium’s “impossibly full emptiness”) charges the final image. One step short of 9+ only because the environment does not physically impede the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the unuttered syllable—tightens when parole time accelerates. The meaningful deepening occurs at the nucleus: Kes must choose inscription or renunciation. Cost is felt (lost coordinates, forfeited sales), though the price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: origin is not inscription but receptive absence. The blank slate’s shimmer reconfigures prior motifs (moonlight, memories, orchard) without moralizing. Subtext in the wardens’ widened eyes and the reader’s “unexplained urge” carries conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“fog the color of forgotten pages,” “surveying void.” Patterned elision (fragmented coordinates, integrated fragmentation) is taught early and paid off in closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains singular and charged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each image advances stakes. Minor scaffold (“he thought,” “he realized”) appears but never in peak beats. No mixed metaphors or loops; rhythm modulates with ascent and descent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The floating glass-orchard library and commerce in memories feel inevitable yet wholly fresh. The inversion—story begins by not writing—transforms familiar quest tropes. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
