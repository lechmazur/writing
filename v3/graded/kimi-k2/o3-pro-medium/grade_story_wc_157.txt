<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist’s rogue-scholar identity is shown through micro-choices—hiding keycodes in footnotes, abandoning tenure—yet interiority stays embodied. The final “abandoned tenure, address, even preferred pronouns” crystallizes cost. Mira’s cryptic pruning and quicksilver grin create immediate status tension. Only slight drift: the “charming” label is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: handing Mira the second seed reconfigures tomorrow’s risk with felt cost. Causal chain—blue fog window, auditor freeze, rooftop escape—holds under a Causal lens. Orientation is anchored by line 3. One micro-turn (seed planted → second seed offered) tightens stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse vents, orchid roots, and ultraviolet garden beds constrain every move; the auditor’s neural meters and rooftop blimps charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy skews to urgent touch and sight under pressure. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from compost corridor to service roof.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—smuggle and plant defiant seed—escalates when Velasquez sells the fog window, forcing a tighter escape. Cost is visible: forfeited identity, second seed doubles tomorrow’s danger. One decisive tightening beat: auditor freeze via paradox loop.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of taxed thought vs. living language emerges through action—seed genome, ant trill, garden glyphs—never stated. Final rooftop image (“cultivating every unspoken word we hadn’t yet been charged for”) reweights premise with conceptual cost.</comment>

<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: “steaming vents,” “luminous wing,” “quicksilver grin.” Compression and elision taught early (“harmless to beetles yet blinding to cameras”) remain legible. Dialogue carries subtext; Mira’s clipped warnings advance plot. No head-hopping; POV stays tight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each line advances stakes or texture. Metaphors (“mantis gunmen,” “liquid silence”) are precise and earned. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: genome-coded vines as graffiti, taxed thoughts as fiscal surveillance. Risky world-building pays off; no derivative echoes. Specificity of insect linguistics and UV garden syntax feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
