<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlen’s contradictory impulses—statistical obsession vs. regret—are embodied in the chipped die and the chalk sums; the final renunciation (erasing the numbers) is earned by the dice roll that delivers the lost evening’s texture, costing him the perpetual-motion quest. Interiority is concrete (“tears were equations”), but a few stock phrases (“grim and oddly hopeful”) keep it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the staircase widens into a landing, the loop loosens, and the cost is the abandonment of the infinite ascent. Causal chain holds—each roll tightens the obsession until the zero/one roll forces stillness. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The staircase, dice, and chalk function as micro-setting that constrains every choice; the final widening into a terrace reconfigures space and possibility. Sensory detail is selective (“clouds moved under us like discarded thoughts”) and filtered through POV urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape vs. acceptance of regret—is signaled early and tightens with each roll. The zero/one outcome forces a visible trade-off: perpetual motion abandoned for stillness. Pressure escalates under causal lens; cost is legible in the erased chalk and the staircase continuing without them.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: regret cannot be outrun by infinite ascent; only stillness reweights it. The final image—dice resting on a healed edge—offers a resonant, non-moral answer. No thematic echo in the closing lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture with controlled rhythm; compression taught early (“numbers ended miles below”) and paid off. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue minimal but subtextual (“Probability is memory”).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density, vivid figurative language without clutter; occasional elevated diction (“arterial thud”) fits the metaphysical frame. No loops or scaffold in peak beats. Rhythm modulates with emotional crests.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: perpetual-motion staircase as engine of regret, dice as memory quantified. The zero-face die is an unforeseeable yet inevitable reconfiguration. Risky structure pays off in the landing that halts ascent without gimmickry.</comment>
