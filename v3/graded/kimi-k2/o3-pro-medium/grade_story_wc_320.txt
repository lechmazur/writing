<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and embodied—her “serenely electric” scarf, the “corroded dial” beneath her glove—but the mentor’s aphorisms feel slightly expository rather than lived. The final choice to dismantle her receiver and sacrifice the fragment is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Internal contradiction is present but muted; the emotional layering is strong yet not fully contradictory. Overall, a compelling, character-driven arc with minor expository drift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the fragment’s repurposing triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration—lights return to the tower city, a silver river births itself—while Mara pockets the spent shard, foreclosing the path of retrieval. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each surrender (“let go of gravity, of language, of failure”) intensifies the pattern until the final image crystallizes cost. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. One hairline slip: the mentor’s voice feels slightly grafted rather than integrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city is rendered with tactile specificity—“rusted handcrank glider,” “toppled transmission pylon bitten by moss”—and the gorge wind physically shapes Mara’s descent. The moon-perigee light and fog “testing forgotten reels” constrain visibility and timing, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the fragment atop the pylon) becomes the stage for the decisive act. No orientation debt; spatial choreography is flawless.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the beginning in every ending”—is signaled early and tightened when Mara must choose between keeping the fragment or repurposing it to revive her homeland. The pressure escalates via Accumulative/Textural deepening: each surrender widens the circuit until the gorge itself reconfigures. Cost is visible: the fragment becomes “only warm glass,” spent. One minor slack: the Hollywood shard’s initial lure feels slightly external to Mara’s agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Mara’s choices: endings as raw material for beginnings, silence as generative. The final image of the silver ribbon river and re-lit catwalks reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext hums in the “hush” that refracts into “prismatic syllables.” No thematic drift; the mentor’s aphorisms flirt with Echo but remain character-bound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet grounded: “the moon pressed closest to the world and whispered the loudest secrets.” Syntax mirrors Mara’s method—discarding assumptions sentence by sentence. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Compression is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “Coils glowed violet, and the air smelled like struck quartz.” Metaphors are precise, never muddled. No loops or scaffold; each line advances stakes or atmosphere. One near-purple phrase—“serenely electric despite the cold”—is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of celestial signal lore, abandoned art-deco infrastructure, and Hollywood myth feels inevitable and fresh. The shard of hush as a literal fragment of stardom is a non-obvious, specific invention. Risk-taking (lyric Accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: this could not be retold with swapped nouns.</comment>
