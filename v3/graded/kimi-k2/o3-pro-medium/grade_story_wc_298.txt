<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictory impulses—reckless drive vs. fiercely gentle mercy—are embodied in every micro-choice; the orchard bargain crystallizes her value hierarchy at visible cost. The burned tarot and second seed anchor interior stakes without slipping into label-speak. Final renunciation is earned and forecloses her own future.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat tightens because/therefore linkage until the decisive trade. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Liora’s swallowed seeds permanently foreclose her dreamed clinic, the cost legible in “blank pages waiting.” No orientation drift; crypt geography stays coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is no postcard: roots constrain movement, skull soil forces moral calculus, pale apples absorb confessed futures. Lantern beams and starlight bracket the single scene, their shifting glow charging the final image. Environment directly shapes the bargain mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save Mira at cost of Liora’s future—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is one sustained tightening: each confession lightens her silhouette, narrows options, until the second seed anchors the void. Price is visceral and irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mercy’s cost emerges from the concrete trade; no moralizing, only the orchard’s arithmetic. Final image of “blank pages” reweights earlier dreams without stating a lesson. Subtext in the Keeper’s smoked-glass gaze and the apples’ whispered futures.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“reckless idealist chasing impossible mercy” teaches the pattern early. Syntax modulates with stress: longer coils during descent, clipped fragments at the swallow. No POV leakage; Keeper’s dialogue carries subtext without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful: “roots glimmered like veins of onyx” does double sensory and symbolic work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Occasional elevated diction (“trammel,” “ballast”) fits the mythic register without register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tarot-driven destiny barter in a bone-root orchard feels inevitable yet new. Tropes of underworld bargains and sister sacrifice are transformed through tactile specificity—obsidian seeds, burned Sun arcana. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure.</comment>
