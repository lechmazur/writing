<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kestrel’s contradictory impulses—thief’s daring vs. apprentice’s reverence—are embodied in bleeding gloves and theatrical bows; the final choice to descend with only wonder earned feels costly. Interiority is vivid, but the Curator’s sudden trust leans on lore shorthand rather than micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sky unknots and time dances, a visible conceptual cost paid for swapping certainties. Causal chain holds—sundial map → summit → swap → sky shift—without gaps; orientation is clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The spire’s ice, violet daylight, and jade chess set constrain every move; the cracked sundial lid reappears to charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, though “frozen lightning” table edges toward excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore play to prophecy—is signaled early and tightened when each swapped piece visibly warms the chamber. Agency drives escalation; the final sigh of the spire is earned cost under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of uncertainty vs. certainty emerges through concrete ritual, not statement; the reconfigured sky offers a non-literal answer. Subtext in the whispering chessmen lingers without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—bruised stars, moonless light—remains consistent; POV never wavers. Compression and patterned elision (“caution wrapped around abandon”) are taught early and paid off in the final descent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; no loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“reliquary humming burdensome certainty”) fits the heightened register without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The heist-as-liturgy premise feels fresh; glacier-jade chess pieces secreting living ink transform familiar tropes. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, yielding inevitable-in-hindsight closure.</comment>
