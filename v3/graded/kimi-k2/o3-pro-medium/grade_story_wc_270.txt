<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora’s motives are clear and her interior contradiction—insurgent caution vs grandmotherly duty—propels her; the final pledge reads earned, but the early reflection block (garden ash→plant telepathy) tilts toward exposition, costing immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: “kite script→pledge→embryo release” each tightens options; closure reconfigures the future (“reconstruction paused in cadence”) with the felt social cost of a child claimed by soil, not throne.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The crater’s heat, sinter cave, fumarole posts, and tamarisk raft all actively constrain tactics and anchor spatial logic; the ash-laden air and scalding springs are sensory, purposeful, and re-charged in the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>A single dominant stake—whether to unseal or leave the destiny-is made explicit; protagonist agency and cost escalate to the pledge beat; the moral price (“child to no throne”) crystallizes without external rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Theme evolves organically: the tension between “coaxing tradition forward” and “releasing its secret heir” threads every beat; the final image of reconstruction hammers reflecting the new cadence avoids explicit moralizing while re-weighting custom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Third-person free-indirect filters strictly through Liora; lexicon is lush yet consistent (“chlorophyll sighs”), syntax modulates with sensory stress; no POV drift, though the lyric density sometimes abstracts urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene urgency; vivid compression (“sulfur circling like frozen lightning”) drives without overwrite; occasional metaphor pile-ups (“comet’s tail of silver hair”) add texture, not clutter; no loops in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Post-volcano reconstruction + empathic botany hybrid is fresh, not gimmicky; the “rebellion via horticulture” premise transforms familiar post-war tropes; the final cadence feels both inevitable and newly struck.</comment>
