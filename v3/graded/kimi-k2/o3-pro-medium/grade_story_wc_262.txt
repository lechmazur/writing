<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling hands, the cotton gloves, the sigh that releases freed affection. Motivation is clear and intensifies: from seeking stored love to realizing it must circulate. The final choice (rewinding, leaving the flyer) is earned and carries felt cost. Minor deduction for a touch of abstract “unused love” phrasing that edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and cadence build until the projector’s motor reveals the hidden tune, reweighting the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—letters dissolve, love circulates, Mira leaves the flyer for the next dreamer. Cost is legible in her departing sigh and the glowing steps. Orientation is swift and coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The projection booth, film strip, and auditorium are rendered with tactile specificity; the projector itself becomes the constraint that unlocks the tune. Sensory hierarchy favors hush, glimmer, and mechanical hum, all filtered through Mira’s urgency. Setting evolves as the strip threads through sprockets and the screen awakens. One minor spatial drift: “downstairs” is mentioned before we know the booth is above.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locating and freeing unused love—is signaled early and tightened once: the discovery that love is paused, not stored, forces Mira to project the film. Agency drives escalation; coincidence merely complicates (thunder as atmosphere, not solver). Cost is visible in the kiss that “glistens like wet ink” and the letters’ dissolution. Slight reserve because the price feels more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: love’s circulation versus exile. Subtext lives in the silent mouthing of letters and the mechanical drone that becomes melody. The final image of dawn on the marquee offers a non-literal answer—love migrates outward as city hum. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in who will next climb the stairs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates from hush to spiral melody. Perceptual signature is crystal-gazer: corridors of light, phosphorescent ink, motes of affection. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” moments) is earned by the fantastical frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences layer sensory, emotional, and conceptual work without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—ink as heartbeat, thunder as hushed wheels. No loops or scaffold. One minor register drift: “psychometry reading” feels slightly expository amid lyricism, but it is brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise—psychometric cinema that releases orphaned love—feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the projector-motor melody. Specificity of never-projected film and goodbye-letter wallpaper prevents template drift. Transformation test: story collapses if any element is swapped.</comment>
