<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maeve’s deliberate craftswoman trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tweezers, soldering, final key-turn) that carry visible cost; her interior contradiction—hope vs. doubt about the tune’s real value—drives the climax. Arden’s motivation is clear but less textured; his tears feel earned yet generic. The balance-wheel names etch intimacy without slipping into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: broken heart → diagnosis → repair → new moral mandate. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Maeve’s counsel reframes the tune from gift to first step of restitution, with felt cost in the velvet’s shifted weight. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cedar-oil workshop is filtered through Maeve’s craft priorities; tools and brass shavings constrain every gesture. The storm outside mirrors but never overwrites the internal stakes. Micro-setting—the balance wheel with etched names—becomes the charged final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can a mechanical heartbeat carry real apology? Pressure tightens when Maeve realizes the tune alone is insufficient; her counter-proposal narrows Ellis’s options and raises moral cost. Agency remains with Maeve; coincidence plays no role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between artifact and action: etched brass vs. lived amends. Subtext in Arden’s rosary-twining and Maeve’s ungreased-cog doubt deepens the question without sermonizing. Final image reweights the premise—music as first beat of a longer sentence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: brass filings in hair, dragonfly-leg tweezers, dawn-colored moth note. Syntax tightens under pressure—“gears the size of millet seeds rolled across suede and stopped like arrested starlight.” No head-hopping; interior texture stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density with zero loops; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Rhythm accelerates during repair, breathes during reflection. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Clean mechanics, precise nouns, strong verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: clockwork heart as literal apology engine, prison workshop origin, music-box repair shop confessional. Risky conceit is fully committed and grounded in tactile detail. No derivative echoes; the moral calculus feels newly minted.</comment>
