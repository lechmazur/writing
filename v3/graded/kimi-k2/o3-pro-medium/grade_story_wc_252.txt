<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eren’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “lonely throb” and “tidal animal beneath his ribs” anchor motive. The scrimshaw’s power over others contrasts with his own sealed heart, creating credible contradiction. Final surrender is earned by prior beats and carries felt cost (“raw and exact”). Minor: the leap from “marching orders” to rowing feels slightly compressed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Eren’s renunciation of landlocked identity is dramatized on the page with visible cost (“memories…spilled out”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of detachment intensifies until surrender crystallizes. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. Whale-call coincidence complicates rather than resolves, satisfying Situational pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Setting is selective and purposeful: sublittoral fringe, kelp ribbons, black-sand shoals all constrain movement and echo internal states. The scrimshaw functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Eren’s dock-worker eye. No orientation drift; spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freedom versus duty—signaled early and tightened by each beat: unloading cargo, whale-call, island’s vanishing. One meaningful deepening: surrender to whale song narrows options and forces renunciation. Cost is visible (loss of former identity). Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of combative tenderness emerges organically through image and action—piracy turned theater, breakers that “fight by refusing to wound.” Final image of island slipping beneath ocean reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in scrimshaw’s glowing faces and whale’s “gentle yet unrelenting” chord. Resonant ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature is distinct—dock-worker’s tactile diction (“ladled patience,” “vegetal applause”). No POV drift; free indirect style clean. Compression and elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language serves pattern rather than clutter. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm mirrors emotional tide. Minor: one near-repeat of “detached” concept within two lines, but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise of violence-free world and disappearing island feels fresh, synthesized through Eren’s specific dock-worker lens. Transformation test: story would collapse if elements swapped. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off. Whale as cantor, piracy as theater—specific inflections avoid cliché.</comment>
