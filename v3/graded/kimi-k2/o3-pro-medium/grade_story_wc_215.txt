<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orin’s mute astonishment and tranquil perception are embodied through deliberate stillness and listening; the choice to accept the covenant is earned by his prior exile and need for purpose. Interior contradiction surfaces when his silence collides with the ghosts’ plea, forcing a non-verbal vow. The final image—his aged likeness in the glass—shows cost: perpetual stewardship without voice. Some emotional labeling (“solitude throbbed for purpose”) edges toward summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pattern of listening, breathing, and echo builds to resonant reconfiguration. Closure is the Charged Poise of the humming oasis and sealed box bearing his future image; cost is lifelong guardianship. Orientation is clear by line 5; no causal gaps. One micro-turn: covenant accepted through heartbeat translation. Ghost dissolution into sound reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The beekeeping oasis is rendered through pollen dust, brittle combs, and sticky echoes that guide Orin’s path; the stained glass box’s bruise-colored halos constrain his slow approach. Environment shifts from scorched to resonant under the hum he releases, charging the final image. Micro-setting (collapsed hive, emerald royal-jelly shards) directly shapes discovery. No static cataloging; every detail tightens choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: preserve unspoken vows. Pressure escalates as Orin deciphers wax indentations and feels the covenant’s weight on his ribs; no external antagonist needed. One decisive tightening—heartbeat becomes carrier wave—forecloses return to exile. Cost is perpetual muteness in service of sound. Ghost plea and humming revival make stakes visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from silence as stewardship: vows survive only through a voiceless keeper. Subtext operates in the ghosts’ eyeless glow and the box’s bruise halos. Final image of aged Orin reweights earlier solitude into sacrificial continuance. No moralizing; resonance lingers in “pollen riding wind.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Orin’s mute perception; tranquil, astonished voice colors every detail (“sticky echo,” “bruise colored halos”). Syntax slows with breath-tempo to mirror patience. No head-hopping; ghosts remain opaque. Distinct perceptual signature sustained to final buzz.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet precise: “waxen combs brittle as pottery,” “frequency rather than flesh.” Rhythm modulates from desert hush to vibrating hum. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances image or choice. Occasional elevated diction (“elegy,” “resurgent”) fits reflective mode. Closure line crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Transforms beekeeping-apocalypse trope into sound stewardship; stained glass box as resonant archive feels fresh. Ghost-beekeepers dissolving into frequency is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk of mute protagonist paying off in earned stasis. Specificity—“emerald shards of long dried royal jelly”—anchors invention.</comment>
