<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s grief-driven motive is clear and embodied; the reluctant metamorphosis shows contradictory impulses (human vs avian) under pressure. The final half-beast compromise carries visible cost and reconfigures identity. Minor drift: “paradoxically steady” is asserted rather than dramatized in body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared half-form anchors both siblings with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (spice, ash, heartbeat) tightens stakes until the final constellation release. No causality breaks; orientation is immediate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Permanent moonlight orchard is vivid, selective, and constrains tactics: the pear tree becomes altar and launch point. Sensory hierarchy (ember, spice, feather) mirrors internal shift. Micro-setting (urn, censer) directly shapes the ritual outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reforge bond beyond death—is signaled early and escalates via each spice-laden breath. The mid-story tightening occurs when metamorphosis exacts payment; final choice narrows options to shared half-form. Cost is legible in forfeited full humanity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief-transformation emerges from concrete ritual acts, not statement. Final image of spice-constellations sailing outward reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext of coexistence vs dominion lingers in beasts’ bow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled voice with distinct perceptual signature (misted rows, crescent-moon pears). Compression and elision are taught early (“after the phoenix rises”) and paid off. No POV drift; internal cadence modulates with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image advances stakes. No loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift. Minor scaffold in “paradoxically steady” label, but it does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: grief alchemy via spice-scented ritual, half-beast guardianship. Phoenix aftermath and orchard midnight-dawn feel inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking (lyric ritual, shared form) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
