<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is embodied and specific (tear on glass, lighter heartbeat), but the absence of on-page opposition keeps her choices low-stakes; the renunciation is felt yet not truly tested by another will.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: polishing spirals and light blooms tighten toward the Charged Poise of the pool lilies; orientation is immediate, closure legible, cost (empty satchel, released pearl) on the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Grotto, mist, and granite table constrain movement and supply ritual space; the turquoise shard’s evolving glow charges the final illumination. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Liora’s bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—share light without fire—escalates as each spiral of polishing intensifies the glow’s risk of stagnation; the release into the pool forecloses keeping the pearl, with visible cost (emptied satchel).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme of gentle illumination versus destructive fire emerges through tactile ritual and the final lilies; no moralizing, only reconfiguration. The pearl of stillness reweights earlier memories into shared guidance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Lyrical, consistent third-person intimate voice; perceptual signature (“zephyr bloom,” “hush pulse”) remains distinct under pressure. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Minor loop risk in “spiral” repetitions, but rhythm variation and clarity remain intact through the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Fresh synthesis of sea-glass alchemy and starless navigation; transformation of memory into shareable stillness feels inevitable. Slight risk of familiar lyric-grotto tropes, but specificity rescues it.</comment>
