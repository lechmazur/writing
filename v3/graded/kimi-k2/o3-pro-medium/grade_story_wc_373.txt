<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clara’s interiority is embodied and stakes-driven; the watch-fob taps against her sternum as a felt metronome of narrowing time. Her contradictory impulses—loyalty to her father versus self-preservation—surface in the hush-breaking moment when she chooses to seal the crack of trust in memory rather than cylinder. The final vow to keep the fob shut carries visible cost: she forecloses the easy replay of that sound. Minor slip: Cinder’s grudging loyalty is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Clara’s silent capture of the rupture reconfigures the market’s silence and her own future use of the fob. Causal chain holds—each beat (browsing, trading, confronting) tightens toward the single decisive hush. Orientation is swift and spatially coherent. One micro-drag: the “collective trust cracked again” moment edges toward summary rather than dramatized beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rotting pier, barnacle glass, and brackish steam are selective, urgent, and filtered through Clara’s stealth priorities. The market’s lantern halos and shell-phonograph anchor the final image. Environment constrains choice: the truce of hush is literally enforced by the architecture. Minor over-description in “gravelous rain” moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the sound before sunrise—is signaled early and tightened by each beat. The sunrise deadline and market’s dissolution create coherent pressure. Clara’s agency crystallizes when she trades map for silence and then withholds the cylinder’s use. Cost is visible: she loses the easy tactical advantage of the wax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of trust as fragile commodity emerges through action—bargaining, hush, fracture—never stated. Final image of “trust holding” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in Cinder’s nod and Reef’s vanishing enriches the moral murk. Slight over-articulation of “curiously steadfast” once.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, rhythmic, and salted with maritime diction (“brackish,” “flotsam”). Compression and elision (“intention rarely walks a straight pier”) are taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature is Clara’s: she notices exits, smells rum, counts heartbeats. No head-hopping; dialogue minimal but subtextual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences advance multiple jobs (“barnacles glittered like broken glass” sets danger and beauty). Rhythm modulates with pressure. Occasional purple flourish (“gravelous rain”) is the only minor artifact. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise—pirate market trading the sound of trust breaking—is fresh and fully committed to. Transformation of familiar smuggler tropes through sensory specificity and conceptual stakes. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure. No close echoes.</comment>
