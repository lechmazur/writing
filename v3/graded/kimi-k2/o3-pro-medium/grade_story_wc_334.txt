<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile curiosity and fear of forgetting collide in the bare-handed mushroom touch. The memory erosion flaw is embodied, not labeled, and the final reciprocation with the fungus carries visible cost (she gives up fresh memories). One more contradictory impulse mid-scene would have nudged this to 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the act of giving memories to the orchard re-anchors Mara inside herself and rewrites the broken sky. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory layer tightens until the final spore-constellation. Cost is on-page: “she pressed her own freshest recollections…into the cap.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The drowned greenhouse is not backdrop; its warped apple trunks and salt-eaten tools physically constrain movement and frame the mushroom. Micro-setting (the cracked lantern globe) becomes the projection surface that enables the climax. Spatial choreography is clean; every object is handled and re-handled.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—escalates when Mara’s mapped voids refuse to fill, forcing the ungloved touch. The single tightening beat (removing gloves) narrows options and exacts a felt price: she must trade fresh memories for old ones. Agency is hers; coincidence never solves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of remembrance as reciprocal stewardship emerges from the orchard’s archive and Mara’s transaction. No moralizing; the final image of spores ascending like new stars reweights the premise without statement. Subtext hums in the lullaby and snow-crunch sounds returned from the voids.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, salted with folkloric diction (“moonmilk,” “seafloor sky”). Compression and patterned elision are taught early (“chronically curious”) and paid off in the rhythmic spore-release. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays anchored to Mara’s sensory priorities.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers action, image, and interiority. Metaphors are fresh and consistent (snow flecks, bioluminescent motes). Zero loops or scaffold; the final paragraph’s cadence shift mirrors the spore ascent. One near-mixed metaphor (“sky itself had drowned”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse as memory archive is a fresh synthesis of maritime and folkloric tropes. Risky underwater botany feels inevitable in hindsight. The fairy ring librarian concept transforms a familiar motif into story engine. Specificity—Breton lullaby, lantern globe projector—anchors universals.</comment>
