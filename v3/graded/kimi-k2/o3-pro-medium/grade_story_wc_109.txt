<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The oracle’s interiority is vivid—her breath-controlled handling of the booklet and spiral-tracing in dust show embodied obsession—but the “mildly obsessed” trait never collides with a contradictory impulse; her arc is steady transmission rather than struggle. Brekan’s silent salute crystallizes a credible shift from skeptic to apprentice of quiet, yet his scarred-arm detail and helm-tuck remain ornamental, not value-revealing. The relationship crucible is present but gentle; status tilts without visible cost to either party. Overall, strong individuation and micro-choice, but the internal contradiction bar for 9+ is not quite met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final breath-bound map reconfigures Brekan’s tactical stance and the fortress’s future under an endless night, with the lone star’s fading path as undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each silence-layer thickens until the spiral dust reweights meaning. Orientation is swift (storm-tossed ridge fort by line 2) and causality intact; no teleporting props. The booklet’s flakes dissolve in a causal loop that charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Storm-ridge fort, brazier coals, and gold-leaf booklet are tactile constraints: altitude clarifies omens, flakes dissolve under breath, spiral dust becomes the map. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—oracle attends to surf pulse, Brekan to armor creak—mirroring internal stakes. Spatial choreography is clean; wind, spray, and lantern failure track across beats. The lone star above the sea charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—navigate endless night via silence-map—is signaled early and tightens through each withheld breath; the oracle’s spiral-drawing is the single decisive intensification. Agency is renunciation: surrendering speech to gain strategic silence, with the visible cost of crumbling gold and the conceptual cost of eternal vigilance. No coincidence resolves; storm merely patrols the new ramparts. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens until the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: silence as both weapon and wound, the paradox of defending dawn by abandoning voice. The ambered hush motif migrates from sea sound to star-path, reweighting its meaning without statement. Final instruction—“lead your men into its afterimage”—offers resonant, non-literal answer to how dawn survives. No moralizing; complexity lingers in the cost of perpetual quiet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined: “marbled hush,” “cindered rubies,” “goblet of teeth” are precise, never purple. Syntax modulates with pressure—long clauses for surf memory, staccato for Brekan’s stilling armor. Perceptual signature is oracle-biased: distance translated into amber, spiral matching pulse. No head-hopping; Brekan’s interiority is inferred through action and oracle’s whispered directive. Dialogue minimal, subtextual, and goal-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence layers image, stakes, or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent—storm patrols ramparts of night—without mixed vehicles. High information density: “gold flakes lifted like moths, circling the brazier before dissolving into luminous dust” performs three jobs (setting, stakes, foreshadowing). Rhythm breathes with scene tempo; final line dissolves to story with earned cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: tactical cartography drawn from silence, a premise that feels inevitable yet unexampled. Trope of oracle-and-captain is transformed through the booklet’s fragility and the inversion of noise as vulnerability. Specificity anchors universals—pebble shore, ridge fort, lone star—without generic placeholders. Risk-taking (lyric retelling via absence) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
