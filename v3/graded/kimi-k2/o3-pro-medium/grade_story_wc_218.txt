<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—accepting death yet striving for legacy—are embodied in her meticulous grafting of copper to living wood; her final renunciation of survival for resonance is earned and costly. Interiority is specific, tactile, and unflinching. The priest’s brief presence supplies external pressure that crystallizes permission without diluting single-POV focus.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard’s chord reconfigures communal perception while Mara’s pulse diffuses into the island’s breathing—cost is the surrender of her remaining time. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each copper coil and root splice layers density until the final hum reweights all prior pattern. No orientation drift; causality of wiring-to-resonance is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Utunao’s storm-ringed atoll, living stone pillars, and copper-wired canopy are rendered with selective sensory precision; the orchard itself constrains every tactical choice and charges the final luminous diagram. Micro-setting (weather-stained diary, sun-focused lens) doubles as tool and mirror. Spatial choreography remains coherent across climbs, solders, and gatherings.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—interspecies respect before death—tightens through each wiring beat; the six-month clock and failing body raise cost. One decisive intensification: the conch-tapped circuit that forces communal recognition. Agency remains with Mara; coincidence (drift-oak bones) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal listening emerges from concrete acts—copper spirals, dolphin clicks, children’s verses—never sermonized. Final diagrams silently reweight the premise: root, reef, and rib share branching math, offering resonant non-verbal answer. Ambiguity lingers without confusion; no moralizing coda.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, salted with botanical precision and tidal cadence; perceptual signature is unmistakably Mara’s. Compression and patterned elision (“salt-sweet fugue,” “brazen calm”) are taught early and paid off in the final hush. No POV leakage; dialogue is sparse but subtextual when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, action, and atmosphere without redundancy. Metaphors are fresh and coherent—“vines chimneyed through clerestory slits,” “copper roots carrying her pulse.” No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm modulates with exertion and rest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms eco-pastoral trope into wired interspecies communion; drift-oak bones and conductive roots feel inevitable yet unforeseen. Specificity of crab-pollination notes and cedar-scented acceptance anchors universals. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
