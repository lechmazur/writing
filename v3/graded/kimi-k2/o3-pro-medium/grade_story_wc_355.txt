<comment>Lysander’s interiority—catalog of silences as emotional labor—charges every micro-choice; his pacifism translates to inventive non-violent action, showing embodied contradiction when grief must be literally tuned. The emotional stake in restoring Oriel’s research (and relationship) is dramatized through the diary clasp itself, but reflection occasionally waxes self-aware, not quite cost-baring. Still, the final image of “Heart Conceding Applause” crystallizes earned stasis with visible regret and acceptance.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands as resonant reconfiguration: empathic understanding achieved via disciplined listening—decisive change of stance with felt cost in unhealed grief. Accumulative/textural lens holds: sonic increments tighten stakes from “Type VII” to “Type IX,” each catalogued silence reweighting the premise. No orientation debt; every move stems from prior causality or pattern that is taught early.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Shadowed workshop, skylight sifted star-glitter, and corroded brass clasp function as micro-setting that physically constrains tactics: Lysander must modulate frequencies instead of prying. The outside parade countdown and distant drums mark temporal pressure that tightens final decision. Environment supplies both method (acoustics) and deadline (firework launch).</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore mentor’s diary without violence—is signaled immediately and escalates one layer at a time: mechanical clasp, psychic latch of remorse, then emotional harmonics. Each tuning attempt costs sonic dexterity and emotional labor; final forgiveness is the tightening choice. Agency throughout; external timeline (fireworks) cannot solve, only press.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Emergent theme: empathy is revealed in overlapping silences. No explicit moral—theme breathes through Oriel’s found note and Lysander’s silent tears. Final “Silence Type IX” reweights prior sonic catalog into emotional truth without statement. Depth preserved by refusal of parade’s spectacle as resolution.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, rhythmic voice with textured diction (“velvet curtains… candle smoke”) stays consistent under pressure. Limited head-hop; all perception filtered through Lysander’s sensory synesthesia of sound. Purposeful ellipses and fragments taught early via sonic catalog remain legible at closure.</comment>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Rich imagery and metaphor serve momentum; each sentence layers acoustic or emotional detail without overwriting. Zero looped phrasing; every sonic label carries new knowledge. Clarity holds through final cadence lift.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of acoustic pacifism as conflict engine—non-explosive fireworks finale provides novel inversion of spectacle. Integration of tuning-fork diplomacy feels inevitable by closure.</comment>
