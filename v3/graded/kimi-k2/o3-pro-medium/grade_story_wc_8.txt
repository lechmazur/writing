<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—rational method vs savage need—drives every micro-choice; the caretaker’s grief-laden pivot feels earned because the ledger’s cost is already embodied in Mira’s trembling hands. One minor slip: “emotionally rational” is asserted more than dramatized until the final bargain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hush after confession reweights the station’s silence from suppression to possibility. Causal lens holds—each beat (petal signal → fresco hinge → ledger → photo upload) tightens options under the rescue-truth stake. Cost is palpable in the caretaker’s tremor and Mira’s unwritten future.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The ivy-choked portico and echoing concourse constrain entry and mood; the mural’s chipped handshake literally hides the crawlspace hinge, so setting shapes tactics. Final image of dawn threading ivy recharges the opening gloom with earned light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rescue truth from lies—escalates through each discovery; the caretaker’s arrival tightens pressure, forcing the digital-upload bargain that forecloses silence. Cost is the caretaker’s betrayal of his former oath and Mira’s uncertain safety.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of truth vs gilded rot emerges through embodied particulars: handshake as polite strangulation, gilded letter atop blood-edged ledger. Final dawn image offers non-literal answer—truth moving like a blackbird relearning song—without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, textured, and historian-tinged (“allegorical marginalia,” “cauterized wound”) without slipping into academic pastiche. Compression and elision (“She would find…”) are taught early and paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image does double duty (“paint chipped around their uneasy smiles”). No loops or mixed metaphors; rhythm modulates with pressure. Occasional elevated diction stays within Mira’s scholarly idiom.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: illuminated medieval marginalia meets whistle-blower thriller in a single scene. The griffin-to-ledger decoding feels inevitable yet non-obvious; risk of bureaucratic allegory is avoided by tactile grit.</comment>
