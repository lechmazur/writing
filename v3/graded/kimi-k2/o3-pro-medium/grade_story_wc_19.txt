<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the claustrophobia vs sky tension drives every micro-choice. The final reconciliation with Father is earned through the hush-vial act and carries visible relational cost. Minor slip: “bottled quiet” line edges toward label-speak, blunting the embodied moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Father’s stance flips under the weight of tasted silence, costing his prior certainty. Causal chain—gravity inversion → doll chime → vial release → Father stilled—holds cleanly. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and paid off in final hush.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The trellis, doll, and inverted sky constrain every tactical choice; the porch’s vines literally hold both bodies at climax. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—thin air, brass-tasting hush—anchoring orientation within 120 words. One hairline slip: “rooftops shimmered like distant ponds” momentarily floats without tactile tether.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—harvest silence without losing Father—tightens once when gravity flips and again when Father climbs. Protagonist’s agency (vial release) forecloses argument and risks spinal cost. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via density of hush and ticking doll chime.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of shelter growing upward emerges organically from Father’s reversal; no moralizing, only the whispered “bottled quiet.” Subtext in the doll’s cracked smile and the hush’s brass aftertaste reweights the premise without statement. Final image of joint reinforcement crystallizes the thematic shift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every image through the collector’s palate. Syntax modulates with pressure—long breaths in calm, clipped clauses during inversion. No head-hopping; Father’s interiority is inferred only through external cues, maintaining POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Metaphors are fresh and internally consistent—“sound droops upward” teaches the inversion rule. One minor loop: “intangibly tangible” appears twice within four lines, a hairline artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of gravity-inverted silence harvesting is non-obvious and fully committed to; no genre templates match. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure. Specificity of brass-tasting hush and porcelain chime makes the concept irreplaceable.</comment>
