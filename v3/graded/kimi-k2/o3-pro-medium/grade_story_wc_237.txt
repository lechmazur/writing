<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Seren’s interiority is embodied and specific; the scars-as-lanterns choice at the end is earned by the ritual of inscription and the blood-ink beat. Motivation (transform scars into stories) is dramatized, not declared. The single micro-choice—cutting her palm to mix wound with remedy—carries visible cost and forecloses fear. No secondary character pressure, but Master Yulo’s silent witness is sufficient for the scene’s crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Seren’s stance toward her own history crystallizes when she writes the unsanctioned rune and the platform descends. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each crystallized droplet layers pressure until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the blood-ink hiss and the thunder’s shift from threat to dialogue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating rock platform, obsidian tiles, and crystallizing tea are vivid and selective; the tea’s phase-change directly constrains the writing ritual. Weather (storm pause) functions as a live clock that forces the final inscription before the next deluge. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift. The micro-setting (palm scar as ink source) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turning lived pain into authored meaning—is signaled early and tightened once: the storm’s return demands completion. Escalation is accretive: each crystallized stanza increases urgency until the blood-ink beat. Agency is clear; coincidence (storm timing) complicates rather than rescues. Cost is visible in the reopened wound and the unsanctioned rune.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the ritual itself: restoration through remembering. The grandmother’s lullaby letter, the thunder-bird feather, and the lanterns-of-scars image weave into a non-moralizing resonance. Final image—storm translated into dialogue—reweights the premise without exposition. Subtext operates in silence and gesture; no thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is Seren’s scholarly sensorium fused with childhood awe. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during the cut, longer breaths during descent. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. POV remains tight; no filter-verb clusters. Non-standard punctuation is absent; rhythm is purposeful and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (tea shards as newborn stars, scars as braille) are fresh and internally consistent. No overwriting in peak beats. Minor elevated diction (“vermilion ink made of both wound and remedy”) is earned by ritual context. Final line anchors and releases tension cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The rune-ink tea ceremony is a fresh synthesis of mythic and scholarly modes; the crystallizing tea and blood-ink rune are non-obvious yet inevitable. Thunder-bird feather as quill transforms childhood superstition into tool. Risk-taking (unsanctioned rune, open storm dialogue) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity throughout prevents template drift.</comment>
