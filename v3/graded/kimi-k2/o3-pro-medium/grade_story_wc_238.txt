<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marisol’s contradictory motives—gossip-monger vs. penitent exorcist—are embodied in the lilac bait and the Tesla coil; her micro-choice to play the adagio through her own body carries visible cost (electric possession) and forecloses the path of mere voyeurism. Interiority stays concrete and character-specific, though the final “overdue apology” line edges toward summary rather than embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard reprieve and the stump offering crystallize the new moral weight Marisol now carries. Causal chain (lilac → coil → possession → song → delay) is tight under a Causal lens; no orientation drift. The final image of lilac that “still refuses to fade” is the exact sentence where cost becomes legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Archive dust, alto clefs, and the “cracked windows” constrain movement and transmit the song; the stump becomes the charged micro-setting that anchors closure. Selective sensory economy (ozone mingled with lilac) keeps pressure high while grounding the ethereal premise in tactile detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver Dulio’s apology before the orchard falls—is signaled early and tightened by the literal countdown of saws. The single decisive turn (offering her body as conduit) narrows options and exacts the price of possession; escalation is causal, not coincidental.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of absolution through imperfect, self-implicating art emerges from the lilac-and-currents ritual rather than any stated moral. The final stump image reweights the entire gossip-column premise: rumor can become fragile conduit for grace, but only if the teller pays the electric toll.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is noir-lyric, tactile, and consistent: “gossip-column exorcist,” “blue sparks crawled over filing cabinets,” “a chord missing its middle note.” Distinct perceptual signature under stress; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression and metaphor serve pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm modulates from noir clipped (“Fog clung…”) to lyrical swell during possession, then back to spare final cadence. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; high information density (“sheet music stalled here like a throat clearing”) advances both atmosphere and plot.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: noir ghost-exorcist meets municipal archive rescue opera. The Tesla-coil séance and lilac bait transform familiar ghost-atonement into something specific and inevitable. Risky premise fully commits without gimmickry; the stump-lilac payoff could belong to no other story.</comment>
