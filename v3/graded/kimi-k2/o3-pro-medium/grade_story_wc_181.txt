<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“lungs overflowing and eyes stinging”), but the final renunciation—accepting stewardship—leans on abstract summary rather than a concrete micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the curator’s promise to “remember forgetting” crystallizes a new stance with felt cost (frost rewriting his lungs). Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the orchard’s glow brightens as cadence shift and cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (“optical roots coiled overhead, drinking starlight”), and the orchard’s pollen physically alters the curator, constraining his next breath and charging the final image. Micro-setting (cameo against bark) also functions as choice-limiter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access forbidden knowledge—tightens when the curator realizes participation demands irreversible self-folding. One decisive intensification: pollen coats lungs, rewriting him. Cost is visceral and legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme of nonlinear inheritance emerges organically through the orchard’s grafted histories and the cameo’s future-story. Final image of “footnotes in someone else’s first chapter” offers non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature (“wet whisper,” “punctuation marks drifting like small white fish”) remains under pressure. Purposeful elision (“he remembered in advance”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Minor scaffold (“he wondered… he realized…”) appears but never within the closure beat. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question><comment>Premise synthesizes archival sci-fi with lyric mysticism in a non-obvious way; the pistachio-cameo-as-future-vessel feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky structure (bathroom epiphany, pollen rewrite) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
