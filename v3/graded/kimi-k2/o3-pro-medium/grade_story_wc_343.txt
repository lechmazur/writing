<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aleksei's motivation (chart the new discovery) crystallizes via tangible micro-choices—kneeling at the hopscotch, chalking numbers, noting the light-bird rhythm—while his flaw (restlessness) sustains cost: he sleeps on deck and wakes smeared with evidence ("charcoal smears streaking his cheeks like war paint"). Interiority stays embodied ("trembling solitude") and the final renunciation of normal charts arrives with earned stasis as the isle renames the sky.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens: Because Aleksei watches stranded luminance AND starlings, therefore he chalks the glowing square pattern, therefore he deciphers hidden coordinates, therefore the Zephyr banks northwest, therefore the mist island rises to greet them. Closure reweights the map—his personal grid replaces official meridians—at visible cost of accepted isolation and known geography. No causal leaks or retroactive fixes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The airship anchors are sketched via tight sensory triangulation (starling veers, chalk grit under thumbnail, sails creaking "like doorways into fables"). The hopscotch board functions as micro-setting-constraint: every luminous square narrows navigation options and ultimately maps the floating island. Consistent sky/valley geography, no floating props or time dilation breaks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“before routine dulled his skies”—tightens decisively: the moment Aleksei aligns the hopscotch grid with wheeling birds and luminous threads, the option to fly ordinary trade routes forecloses. Cost crystallizes: the world they knew (named, charted continents) is left below as they commit to an unnamed cloud-isle. Coincidence merely discovers the isle; Aleksei’s agency pilots toward it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of mapping as translation of wonder emerges organically: the dusty squares become staves for starling music, the phrasebook marginalia reweights from dead scrap to bridge-lonely-universe, the closing image ties "cloud solid with light" to sociable isolation re-coined as listening compass. No summative moral; resonance arises from concrete image of island suspended “above the world.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>First-person intimate voice remains consistent, biased toward tactile instruments (fingers chalked, heart pressed under dog-ear), perceptual signature filters sky through apprentice hunger rather than encyclopedic travelogue. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short breaths during starling veers stretch to wonder-drenched long sentences at the reveal—no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>High density, varied rhythm; each sentence performs double duty (e.g., “Thread of pale gold flickered like abandoned lantern beams caught in cobwebs” delivers atmosphere and foreshadows navigation thread). Zero loops; no filler transitions between discovery beats. Figurative language stays concrete (“ink dropped upon water,” “doorways into fables”) without overwriting the closing glow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fresh synthesis—hopscotch as ephemeral telescope, starlings as co-composers, phrasebook margin as personal prophecy—feels specific to this sky-curious apprentice and irreplaceable. The mist island feels inevitable once its pattern is danced across the deck, fulfilling risk without gimmickry.</comment>
