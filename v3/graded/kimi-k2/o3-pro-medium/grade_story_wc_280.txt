<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (synesthetic “C-sharp in my nostrils”), but the janitor’s contradictory impulses remain mostly reported rather than enacted; the final “decide to be late” is earned yet feels lightly costed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the loop snaps, Lazzaro stands rosy, and the orchard re-sets. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; however, the causal braid between coin-breath-echoes could be one sentence tighter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The hedge-maze orchard is tactile, luminous, and directly constrains the climax: the velvet curtains materialize between pear trees, anchoring the final braid of realities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mend the ghost’s stalled encore—is signaled early and tightened through the breathing-echo mechanic; the cost (being late for dawn shift) is visible but modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of time as recoverable possibility emerges from concrete sensory events; the final image of “facet-cut” eras avoids moralizing while reweighting nostalgia as earned rather than borrowed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct synesthetic perceptual signature sustains throughout; patterned elision (“breathe echoes, not air”) is taught early and paid off at closure with no POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“corridor of infinite mirrors”) risk overwriting but never stall the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of janitor-meets-phantom-opera inside a synesthetic hedge maze; the tarot-coin-as-metronome device is specific and non-obvious.</comment>
