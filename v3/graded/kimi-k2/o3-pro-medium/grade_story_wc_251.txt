<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is vivid—his odd hearing, the “forests of second thoughts” desire—but the final renunciation (“only slow-growing shade”) is slightly under-costed; we feel the grotto’s approval more than his own forfeiture. Still, contradictory impulses (applause vs. quiet rebellion) are dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: nightly window displays build pattern until the grotto puzzle completes the sequence. Closure is a Charged Poise—the town’s collective pause—whose cost is the forfeiture of quick victories. One transition (grotto return) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Cobalt library in mist” and the mineral-blue grotto constrain Silas’s tactics and charge the final image; sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“plant forests of second thoughts”—is signaled early and tightened by the nightly displays and grotto puzzle. Escalation is accretive; the cost is the town’s surrendered speed and Silas’s anonymity. One deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: chess positions, iron filings, hush. Final image of “every piece… one quiet move from transformation” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the grotto’s silence is potent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“notation paper” moon, “cathedral echo” crickets—remains controlled under pressure. POV is stable; no head-hopping. Compression (“torch darkened”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and patterned. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with scene needs. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and re-charge motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: chess pedagogy + magnetic grotto + civic light-installation rebellion. Risky quiet ending lands with undeniable pressure. Specificity of “rook-and-bishop riddles” and “glass knight” prevents template drift.</comment>
