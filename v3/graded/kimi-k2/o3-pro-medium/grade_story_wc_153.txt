<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eline’s contradictory impulses—tenderness vs. armor—are embodied in the shard’s sting and the voiced apology; the interior arc from paralysis to compassionate decision is credible and costly. The final renunciation of silence is earned by prior pain and the spirits’ staged memory. Minor: “cryptic medium” remains more label than dramatized vocation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Eline’s voiced apology crystallizes choice and reweights the stake from self-protection to shared vulnerability; the moonlight’s healing seam is the visible cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer intensifies until the overflow of liquid words forces stance change. No causality breaks; orientation is immediate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mangrove labyrinth, spirits, and shard function as micro-setting that physically tightens corridors and collects memory, directly constraining Eline’s path and the final overflow. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; brackish water, moonlight, and condensation guide choice. The shard’s tactile presence charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she voice the apology or let silence fester—is signaled early and tightened once when the shard overflows and the spirits replay the balcony memory. Agency drives the escalation; the cost is the reopened chest wound and the irrevocable sending of the final letter. No external coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of fierce tenderness emerges through embodied action: the shard’s pain, the voiced apology, and the moonlit seam. Subtext lives in condensation messages and the spirits’ laughter. Final image of moon as delivered letter reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity is preserved—no tidy absolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled compression and patterned elision; perceptual signature is consistent—“braille for the living,” “liquid punctuation.” Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating toward the voiced release. No POV drift; every metaphor is POV-filtered and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and symbolic work without redundancy. Metaphors are precise and internally coherent—“rust flakes drifting like reddish snow.” No loops or scaffold; minor elevated diction remains within Eline’s mystical register. Final paragraph cadence is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of medium, mangrove spirits, and gargoyle shard as memory vessel; the liquid-word overflow is an inventive payoff. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss. Specificity prevents trope drift; the apology-as-liquid is non-generic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
