<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aikan’s interior contradiction—visionary curse vs. grounded promise—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation of frictionless drift carries visible cost when his feet regain weight. Interiority is embodied in drifting tear-spheres and brine-scented recall rather than labels. The only drag is a brief “promise loosened its claws” phrase that edges toward summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern-building (stones, dust, aurora) tightens until the final image reweights the premise with earned stasis—friction returns gently, foreclosing the prior weightless world. Orientation is immediate; causality holds through lyrical elision taught early. Closure beat—“the ground resist his weight”—pays cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop but constraint: frictionless bluff, magnetic eddies, and aurora directly shape how stones must be anchored by desire. The tidal bluff’s grooves remain as permanent scar, charging final image. Micro-setting (painted stones, star dust) functions as tactile tools that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fulfill the childhood promise to eels—is signaled early and escalates via each stone placement; misalignment would unleash a snarling future. One decisive tightening: final stone locks pattern, trading perpetual drift for restored friction. Cost is felt in the sudden rasp of ordinary breath.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of covenant-as-knowledge emerges through concrete ritual rather than statement; the migration map of his own soul reweights earlier abstractions into lived obligation. Final image of eels dancing around grooves offers resonant, non-moral answer. Only a whisper of “sacred patterns” skirts label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure: “tears drifted…orbiting his cheeks.” Perceptual signature is eel-herder specific—magnetic eddies, brine memory, sinuous cadence. No head-hop; POV modesty holds. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” risk) stays within taught pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image, motion, and consequence. Metaphors (aurora as “trembling veil,” dust as “liquid geometry”) are coherent and payoff-linked. No loops or scaffold; minor filter-verb cluster (“he realized”) is brief and does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise—eel-herder translating storm-logic via frictionless ritual—is fresh synthesis; eels speaking primes feels inevitable after pattern set-up. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Transformation test: story collapses if eels or star dust swapped for generic tokens.</comment>
