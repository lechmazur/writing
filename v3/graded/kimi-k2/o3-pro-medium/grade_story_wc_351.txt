<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rhea’s contradictory impulses—fear vs curiosity—are embodied in her uneven breath and trembling ribs; the vow to catalog rather than plunder crystallizes her custodial stance with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and helix-specific, but the final shift to “witness” feels slightly abstract, blunting the earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard’s flare layers density until the final museum vision reweights the premise. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Rhea’s custodianship crystallizes with the stitched-constellation mirror—cost legible in her exhale with the canyon.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Moonlit canyon and periscope mirror function as micro-setting that constrains her path and charges the final image; basalt columns and bioluminescent fibers are vivid, selective, and causally active. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—custodianship vs possession—tightens when the mirror’s corridor of light forces her deeper; the cost is the irrevocable entanglement of her own past. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of custodianship emerges organically from the mirror’s visions and Rhea’s vow; final image of stitched constellations offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext operates in the mirror’s tremor and the canyon’s exhale.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“chaotically precise” rendered in syntax that coils and snaps; perceptual signature is unmistakably Rhea’s. No head-hopping; compression and elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful—“bioluminescent vines,” “sedimentary truth.” No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. One hairline slip: “quaking reverie” risks self-parody but is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of submarine relic, synaptic fiber, and dream archaeology; transformation test passed—story collapses without these specifics. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry; closure remains legible.</comment>
