<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aios’s interior contradiction—guard vs. wonder—drives every beat; his telepathic outreach, kneel among the statues, and calibrated release of smoke are embodied choices that visibly cost him certainty and re-animate the others. Motivation remains coherent and intensifies to the final garden of questions. Minor: the chorus of revived statues is sketched more than individuated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ampoule’s violet thread reweights the rule-set (certainty now admits tide-pool uncertainty) with felt cost—the statues’ centuries of erasure. Causal chain holds: ampoule → flaw → revelation → partial release → reanimation. Orientation is anchored early; transitions are legible within one continuous scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The underwater garden is not backdrop; the current, eelgrass tunnel, and coral-frond “blank pages” constrain movement and supply the literal medium for planting ideas. Micro-setting (stone pores, foxglove smoke in water) charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether certainty can survive kindness—tightens once: the ampoule’s structural weakness forces Aios to choose between total revelation (poison) and measured risk. His calibrated release narrows options and visibly pays the price of reawakening the statues. Pressure is coherent under the situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: the tension between certainty and nuance is dramatized through the ampoule’s design and Aios’s restraint. Final image—transparent seed shattering into remembered bell—offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the statues’ static murmurs deepens the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; telepathic “whispers” and “quiet blue sparks” create a distinct perceptual signature. Syntax modulates with pressure—long breaths in garden calm, clipped fragments during revelation. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Aios’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language (foxglove smoke “like guide ropes”) is selective and paid off. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“incisively kind”) is voice-motivated and consistent. Rhythm accelerates into the final bubble-bell.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusing living statues, telepathy, and pharmacological revelation in an underwater ruin feels fresh and inevitable. The ampoule’s dual function (poison / kindness) transforms a familiar trope into a specific ethical crucible. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
