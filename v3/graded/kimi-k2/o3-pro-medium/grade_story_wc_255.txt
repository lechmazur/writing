<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lio’s interior contradiction—wanting to prove beauty in broken hues while fearing pity—drives every micro-choice; the embodied shift from tasting temperature to shared breath with Goran crystallizes earned humility and cost. The “innocently cunning” trait shows in silent plant codes and the deliberate lopsided tear, not labels. Final hand-in-hand return to the furnace forecloses isolation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each added flaw—wilted bouquet, concertina pulse, shard intrusion—densifies the pattern until the asymmetrical globe reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Goran’s bow and Lio’s ash-signed gratitude crystallize new shared stance; cost is the irreversible embrace of imperfection. Orientation anchored by dawn smoke and furnace mouth within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The courtyard’s heat, furnace roar, and prismatic embers constrain every gesture; the concertina reed tongue itself becomes micro-setting that shapes breath and glass. Sunrise fractures caught in the flawed tear charge the final image. Spatial choreography from ledge to annealing oven tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving beauty in flaw—tightens when Goran’s skepticism forces Lio to risk the lopsided gather; the shard intrusion escalates stakes under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: Goran drops flawless shard into melt, surrendering prior mastery. One decisive deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the flawed glass catching sunrise—beauty nests in asymmetry—without moralizing. Subtext in plant codes and silent gestures deepens resonance. Final phoenix effigy refracts prior motifs, reweighting them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture: “smoke trapped in amber,” “cooling slag” shoulders. POV remains tightly focalized through Lio’s synesthetic perception; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates with furnace heat and shared breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops; figurative language serves pressure (“molten globe spun into a lopsided tear”). Occasional elevated diction fits ritual tone. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: colorblind painter + concertina reed glassblowing + plant-code barter. Imperfection-as-beauty trope transformed through tactile synesthesia and shared breath. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure.</comment>
