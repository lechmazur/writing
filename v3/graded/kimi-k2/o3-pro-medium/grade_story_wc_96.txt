<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rook’s hunger to “forge beauty from anarchy” is embodied in every micro-choice—scattering seed-packets of words, stacking dictionaries under beams—yet the monthly molting trait is asserted rather than dramatized, keeping him just shy of full contradiction on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s physical renewal mirrors the pair’s crystallized partnership (“Tomorrow we molt together”), cost paid in the risk of renewed arrest; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first silver fracture to final bloom.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rusted library under constellations is no backdrop; its warped shelves and bullet holes actively constrain tactics—dictionaries become beams, cracks host sonnets—while the glowing steel revealed beneath rust charges the final communal glow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can outlaw language rebuild a ruined refuge?—tightens when sirens cough and citizens drift in; the single deepening beat (Mira’s whistle calling the crowd) visibly raises the cost of exposure yet forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of language as insurgent infrastructure emerges organically from every beat; the final image of “luminous fracture” reweights earlier cracks into illuminated vines without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity about what state power will do next.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“moth wings ticking like minute hands”—with perceptual signature rooted in Rook’s cartographer gaze; compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final communal shimmer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful, with no mixed metaphors or loops. Each sentence layers image, action, and stakes, culminating in the charged final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of post-industrial ruin, outlaw poetics, and communal restoration feels inevitable yet fresh; the “blooming resistance” trope is transformed through tactile specificity—seed-packets of words, ex-inmate library cards—risking sentiment but earning its glow.</comment>
