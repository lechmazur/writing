<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—fixing vs. remembering—are embodied in the pillbox and gear; the final choice to “go west, together” is earned by the tactile repair scene and carries visible relational cost. Elias’s mirrored burns and engineer’s gaze give him credible interiority in silence. Minor slip: “unused courage waits where we decide to carry it” edges toward label-speak, blunting the contradiction at the hinge moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the repaired pillbox ticking against her pulse crystallizes the new alliance with felt cost. Causal lens holds—each glyph, gear placement, and final line follows because/therefore logic. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4. One hairline slip: the phrase “vouchsafe it” is slightly abstract for the decisive beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The bluff’s thawing snow and silver mist constrain every move—footing, visibility, and the ephemeral cipher. The pillbox-as-micro-setting charges the final image when its ticking merges with pulse. Selective sensory detail (rime on coat, brass gear as “gold seed”) keeps economy tight. Weather never resolves conflict, only complicates it—meets situational lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether trust can be repaired—is signaled early and tightened once: the gear must fit or the past stays broken. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves. Cost is legible in the burns and the audible click that “aligns a hinge inside their ribs.” Could edge higher if the price were sharper than a metaphorical hinge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Theme of repair vs. erasure emerges through the gear and the melting cipher; no moralizing. Subtext in silence and the looping curve “I remember” carries more weight than speech. Final image of “clock newly wound” offers non-literal resonance without assertion. One soft echo: “fixing what’s broken is not the same as pretending it never shattered” flirts with thesis-statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—breath-held mist, barren soil, ticking pulse—remains under precise control. POV stays locked to Mara; Elias’s interiority is inferred through gesture, never breached. Syntax modulates with pressure: long breaths in description, clipped “go west, together” at climax. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>High density: “silver hush,” “thawing secrets,” “tooth he had broken from time itself” all earn their place by charging stakes. Rhythm breathes—no template cadence. One mixed metaphor risk—“mist acceptingly folded around them”—but context saves it. Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Spy-reconciliation trope is refreshed through clockwork micro-repair and snow-cipher mechanics. Brass gear as shard of broken time feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off; no gimmickry. Slight proximity to familiar “burned spy meets ex-lover” frame keeps it just under 9.0.</comment>
