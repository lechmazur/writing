<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quillon’s prism-minded cataloguing and embodied micro-choices under pressure (e.g., “numbers became colors, colors became directions”) are vivid and consistent; the final renunciation—vowing to guard the knowledge—carries visible cost. Interior contradiction is hinted but not fully dramatized in-scene, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystalline seed’s light spells the final combination, every drawer unlocks, and Quillon’s stance crystallizes with the cost of permanent guardianship. Causal chain (doodle → threshold → cabinet → seed) holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The grotto’s inverted gravity and drifting dust motes actively constrain tactics; the doodle’s glow and the cabinet of memories charge the final image. Selective sensory detail (“stalactites rang like brittle bells”) is woven through action, never ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve forgotten combinations before the hour ends—is signaled early and tightened by the live clock; the final unlocking costs Quillon perpetual vigilance. Escalation is one sustained deepening rather than multiple reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of vigilance versus forgetting emerges through concrete particulars (seed, drawers, mnemonic colors) without moralizing. Final image of “newborn galaxy seeded by vigilance” reweights prior motifs with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—“prism-minded,” synesthetic mapping—remains consistent; rhythmic control under pressure (“He inverted his lantern…”) teaches the inversion pattern early and pays it off at closure. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>High information density, vivid specificity, and zero loops; occasional ornate phrasing (“bruise thought”) is voice-motivated and never muddies causality. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of cartographic cipher, inverted gravity, and memory vaults feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (gravity inversion as literal mechanic) heightens stakes without gimmickry; no close genre echoes.</comment>
