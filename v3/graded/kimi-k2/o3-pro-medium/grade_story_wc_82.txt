<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s grief is embodied in every micro-choice—polishing gems, folding invisible paper, sealing the lantern with “braided sighs.” The contradiction between her wish to banish sorrow and her acceptance that it must stay is dramatized, not stated. The final moment of holding her brother’s voice “without bleeding” is earned by the prior causality of pain transformed into wings. Only the acolyte’s brief appearance prevents a higher score, as status dynamics are under-used.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern cracks, cranes scatter, and mourners’ shadows rejoin their bodies—cost is the irreversible release of Jorin’s last dream. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (steam, glass, paper wings) intensifies until the final cadence reweights grief into shared light. Orientation is taught early via the “hour precise” and the basilica’s inverted ladders. No causality breaks; every beat advances the pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating tea garden’s porcelain cups and airborne koi are not mere scenery; they supply the literal raft and the kettle that receives the lantern. The basilica’s glass corridors refract starlight into ladders, constraining movement and perception. Micro-objects—gems, folding knife, paper cranes—function as setting extensions that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform grief into usable light—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Lyra chooses to release rather than hoard the dream. The cost is explicit: “untamed sorrow could shatter the basilica,” yet she bows. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence merely complicates. One meaningful deepening suffices and lands with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of giving grief wings; no moral is stated. The final image—cranes choosing to stay—offers a non-literal answer to how mourning endures. Subtext operates in gestures: the brother’s released shadow “darting among the cranes.” Complexity is preserved; sorrow is neither vanquished nor sanctified.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: “the wind was tasting for sorrow,” “knot of braided sighs.” Perceptual signature is Lyra’s—every detail filtered through lantern-maker’s craft and bereaved sister’s ache. Patterned elision (inverted ascent/descent) is taught early and paid off at closure. No POV leakage; diction remains within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. Metaphors are coherent—cranes “slender as breath,” shadows “like long-missed shoes.” No loops or scaffold; information multi-tasks. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating during the lantern release. Minor elevation in diction (“apothecary dust”) is voice-motivated and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of lantern craft, dream harvesting, and grief alchemy feels inevitable yet fresh. Familiar tropes—floating islands, paper cranes—are transformed through Lyra’s specific vocation and loss. Risky structural inversion (descending while ascending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration of sorrow into communal light is non-obvious and earned.</comment>
