<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cressida’s contradictory hunger to bottle “presence” while surrendering mastery is dramatized in tactile beats (pressing the shell to Roan’s burn, scattering colors). Interiority stays concrete—“tasting salt and star-dust”—and the final renunciation carries visible cost. Roan’s secondary pressure is clear but his interiority is thinner, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the choice to scatter the unresolved spectrum reweights the premise under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with felt cost (“the world tilt, lighter yet fuller”). Causality holds: the shell’s equations fail → they choose non-arrival. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no debt applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ember nexus, basalt slab, and pocket-sun vials constrain every move; heat and slagglass guide bodily risk. The shell as micro-setting absorbs pain and releases chords, charging the final image. Selective sensory detail—“heat shimmer,” “bronze ampoules”—keeps economy tight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the density of presence”—tightens when colors destabilize, forcing the choice to relinquish mastery. Escalation is textural: spectrum collapse and burned palm raise cost without conventional reversals. Agency remains with Cressida throughout; the final surrender forecloses the bottled-power path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the refusal to commodify immediacy; the scattered gradients reconfigure value itself. No moral is stated—resonance arrives via the shell’s dying chord. Ambiguity is purposeful: cities may yet be healed or weaponized, but that risk is now externalized, not owned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Cressida’s alchemical sensorium—“pocket-sun threads,” “curling acoustics”—with rhythmic compression that accelerates under pressure. No head-hopping; Roan’s interior is implied only through gesture and dialogue. Patterned elision (“they stepped…sideways”) is taught early and paid off at exit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary from liquid long arcs to staccato observations; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Mixed metaphors are avoided—“space sagged like warm glass” sustains physical logic. One paraphrase loop (“returning differently” echoed twice) is minor and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The alchemical-bottled-now premise feels fresh, yet emotional specificity—“density of presence” as civic wound—grounds it. Risky sideways exit transforms familiar twilight trope into ontological slippage. Synthesis of science-romance and lyric compression is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
