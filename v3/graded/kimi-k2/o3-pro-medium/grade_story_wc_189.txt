<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marella’s interiority is embodied and specific—her palm against the grotto floor, the hum that is “not aiming at the cicada but at the hollows.” The contradiction between her habitual oblique observation and the need to speak directly is dramatized in the vision-branching beat. The final micro-choice—breaking the hum to speak first—carries visible cost in Quillon’s “relief pooling like phosphorescence.” Only the slight over-articulation of “texture of time” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marella’s deliberate pause in speech reweights the council outcome and is felt in the final image of the ocean “holding breath.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (hum, cicada song, star-shift) thickens until the cadence shift clicks. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 4. Cost is legible in the relinquishing of righteous anger.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto’s cool grain, star-holed sky, and kelp-threaded air are selective and POV-filtered. The jade cicada itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice when its wings cast “darting shadows across Quillon’s eyes.” Only a touch of postcard diction in “ancient grotto under stars” prevents 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to speak at dawn—tightens through the cicada’s song that reveals two futures. The meaningful deepening is the shift from storm-surge words to gentle tide, paid for by Marella’s renunciation of immediate catharsis. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no external coincidence resolves it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: the way oblique attention (tidal pools, sideways moonlight) becomes a moral stance toward speech. The final image of the ocean inhaling offers a non-literal answer—“cosmic hesitations” resolve by listening. No moralizing; complexity remains in the cost of restraint.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined: “the sea comb its fingers through stone” teaches the pattern early; the cicada’s “memory of garden wind trapped in a shell” sustains it. Perceptual signature is consistent—Marella notices through tidal metaphors and marine textures. No POV leakage; Quillon’s interior is only inferred.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “the air seemed stitched by invisible kelp threads” does triple sensory work. Rhythm modulates—long breaths in description, clipped beats at closure. Only one minor scaffold (“she foresaw… she also foresaw”) slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of tidal lore, jade cicada, and oblique speech feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk in the lyric mode pays off: the cosmic pause becomes a usable moral instrument. No close echoes; the transformation test passes—swap the island and the insight collapses.</comment>
