<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ashraf’s contradictory impulses—hunger for answers vs. refusal to weaponize—are dramatized in the final surrender of the geode; the cost (extinguishing the last light of his bride) is embodied and felt. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The single on-page relationship (Sanaa) applies immediate pressure that alters his stance. Micro-choice hierarchy is clear: the crystal > continent > memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Ashraf completes the circuit, reversing the drain at the price of the crystal and the bride’s memory. Causal lens holds throughout—each beat is linked by “because/therefore” logic. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in the final image: “nothing felt lighter, yet everything felt less heavy.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The geode, the crater’s glassy weeds, and the floating observatory all constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: “acid clouds,” “copper spines,” “violet dust spiraling downward.” Micro-setting (the geode as compass) functions as setting that guides movement. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent continental destruction—is signaled early and tightened when the node’s pulse matches the drones. One meaningful turn: surrendering the geode forecloses both weaponization and personal remembrance. Escalation is causal and driven by Ashraf’s agency; cost is visible in the dissolution of the crystal. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between memory and survival; no explicit moralizing. The geode’s final dissolution reweights the motif of light without sermon. Subtext operates in gesture: Sanaa’s laugh “without mirth” signals the inevitability of weaponization. Final image offers resonant ambiguity—“uncertain whether he had saved a continent or merely delayed the next equation of war.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent: “the sky sang with iron,” “circuit breakers cool.” Perceptual signature is Ashraf’s—every detail is filtered through trauma and wonder. No head-hopping; POV distance remains stable. Compression and elision (“steam curled off copper spines; technicians slept”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadences for reflection, staccato for crisis. Figurative language is precise and purposeful; no purple patches. Opening and closing lines are charged and resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—quantum cartography of post-blast energy—feels fresh and specific. Tropes (survivor’s quest, scientist ally) are transformed through embodied trauma and scientific lyricism. The synthesis of drone warfare, geode crystal, and perturbation theory is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric compression, conceptual stakes) heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
