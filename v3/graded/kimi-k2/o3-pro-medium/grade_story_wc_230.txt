<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilya’s interior contradiction—rational method vs. involuntary truth-telling—drives every beat; the memory he fears is embodied and costly. The micro-choice to confess under the eye is earned and alters tactics. Secondary pressure from Mara is brief but sharp. Only the sister remains off-page, limiting relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the eye’s filter reweights empathy, cost is the spoken memory and shared secrecy. Causal lens holds—each beat because/therefore—until the final communal plan. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 5. One meaningful tightening when Mara warns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The ravine orchard’s cables and swinging fruit constrain movement and echo internal sway; storm scent and mineral-veined glass charge the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors Ilya’s truffle-trained attention. Micro-setting (glass eye under tongue) functions as setting that alters choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—psychological safety via filtered empathy—signaled early. Escalation tightens once: confession under eye forecloses solitary safety, demands communal risk. Cost is the spoken abandonment and future danger from council. Agency drives every turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of kindness as scaffold emerges from the eye’s function and the plan to seed knowledge; no moralizing. Final image of “forgiving chord” reweights prior discord without statement. Subtext in Mara’s trembling whisper carries fear and care.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: truffle-forager’s copper probe, wet-parchment scent, mineral-scarred glass. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during confession, longer cadence in orchard rocking. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density, zero loops; figurative language purposeful (“doves wrapped in cloth”). No mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports breath and urgency. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: empathy virus + antique eye + fungal spore messaging. Premise fully committed; no retreat to generic dystopia. Risky communal ending feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of truffle scent and glass veins anchors universals.</comment>
