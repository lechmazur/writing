<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the pulse-recording beat crystallizes his contradictory motives. The final choice to share the lens is earned by prior beats and carries visible cost. Mara’s late entry is under-leveraged for status tension, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the communal projection reweights the premise with undeniable social cost. Causal chain holds—ticket fragment → corridor → vault → shared light—without gaps. Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The crystal forecourt, quartz chalices, and magnetic vault constrain Silas’s movements and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; humidity as gate key is a fresh constraint. Environment directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—retrieve lens to thaw mistrust—is signaled early and tightened when the vault shelves “test” Silas. One meaningful escalation: the beam projects his heartbeat, forcing public transparency. Cost is visible in the relinquishing of secrecy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of transparency emerges organically from Silas’s choices; no moralizing. Final image of shared light reweights prior secrecy without statement. Subtext in the silent accord with Mara is deft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature (“resonant hush he could almost taste”) is consistent. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off. No POV drift; diction stays within registrar’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Minor register elevation in “communal flutter” is voice-motivated and does not obscure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of synesthetic clues, volcanic-glass lens, and post-linguistic society feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric structure pays off in the heartbeat projection. No derivative echoes; premise is transformed through specific detail.</comment>
