<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Thorne’s watchful patience and quiet resolve are embodied in tactile micro-choices (aligning the quill holder by one final degree). Interior contradiction—duty vs rebellion—surfaces in the same gesture. The shared glance with Amara crystallizes a relationship shift under pressure. Cost is felt: tomorrow he must resume his post while knowing he has betrayed it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: blackout → signal placement → recognition → dispersal. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cradle of sparks is “lit,” irrevocably changing the fort’s future. Orientation is immediate; causality is clean. Cost is legible in the final image of Thorne walking back to a post he has already subverted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Twilight sandstone, extinguished lamps, and the half-painted sundial are not backdrop; the angles of unpainted segments encode the rebellion’s map. The bronze quill holder’s reflections at dawn will trigger action—setting actively guides choice. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Thorne’s practiced vigilance. Spatial choreography is exact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: ignite silent revolution without bloodshed. Pressure tightens when blackout provides the single window to plant the signal. Thorne’s micro-choice—one final degree—narrows options irreversibly. The cost is the personal betrayal of his sworn duty, visible in his silent return to post.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete objects and gestures: bronze, angles, and hush become vehicles for non-violent resistance. Subtext lives in the wink between sentinels and the unspoken weight of the quill holder. Final image reframes the fort’s sandstone walls from prison to tinderbox without moralizing. Complexity is preserved: victory is prospective, danger real.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Thorne’s perceptions; no head-hop. Voice is textured—weathered fingers, luminous sandstone, winking hush—without purple excess. Dialogue is spare, subtextual; Amara’s single nod carries more than exposition could. Rhythm modulates with tension: long reflective sentences give way to clipped final beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is precise—“like captured fire,” “blood through a waking body”—and never muddled. No loops or scaffold; no filter-verb clutter. The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the quiet ignition it describes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Revolution via half-painted sundial angles and bronze reflections is a fresh, non-obvious mechanism. The cradle of sparks as conceptual weapon rather than object deepens the premise. Specificity of the fort’s twilight blackout and encoded geometry prevents generic fantasy drift. Risk is taken—quiet over spectacle—and fully earned.</comment>
