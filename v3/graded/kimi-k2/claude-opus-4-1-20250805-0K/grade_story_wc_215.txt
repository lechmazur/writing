<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is precise—her careful steps, the warmth of the glass, the way she “reads” the ghosts through gesture. The final renunciation (to remain guardian of silence) is earned by the remembered weight of her grandfather’s muteness and the cost of that legacy. A hairline slip: the phrase “tranquil perception” edges toward label-speak, though it is quickly embodied in the grandfather’s gaze.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara lifts the box, understands the covenant’s failure, and chooses perpetual custodianship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory return (amber light, warm glass, unsent letters) reweights the stake until the final image crystallizes. No causality breaks; the ghosts’ midnight urgency and dawn fade are coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The rotting hive frames, bleached boxes, and luminous stained-glass crate are not backdrop but instruments: the glass’s warmth guides her fingers, the empty hives dictate the ghosts’ choreography. The desert’s slow erasure is the persistent constraint that charges her final endurance. Micro-setting (the box as portable sanctuary) functions as setting and tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the unspoken—tightens once: from curiosity about the ghosts to irrevocable guardianship. The escalation is textural: each layer of documents and photographs increases the emotional cost of abandonment. Agency is renunciation; the price is lifelong solitude, legible in the final line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from silence itself: the covenant failed not from betrayal but from unsaid doubts. The ending offers no moral, only the luminous weight of preserved absence. The grandfather’s mute fidelity and Mara’s chosen echo reconfigure the premise without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is spare, desert-bleached, yet rhythmic: “broken teeth,” “captured sunset,” “phantom bees.” Perceptual signature is tactile and selective—she notices temperature, texture, the ghosts’ gestures, not their faces. No POV drift; the lyric compression is taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, high-density; every image does double duty (“luminous weight,” “honey in abandoned combs”). One minor loop: “weight of what remained unspoken” appears twice in adjacent paragraphs. Otherwise, rhythm modulates with pressure, and no figurative muddle intrudes on the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic beekeeper elegy is familiar, yet the fusion of extinct bees, stained-glass reliquary, and mute covenant feels specific and inevitable. The ghosts’ choreography and the box’s amber glow transform trope into lived ritual. Risk—the lyric stillness—heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
