<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marla’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling bow, the warm wood against her chin—but the hitchhiker’s motives remain abstract, diffusing the relational crucible. The final choice to keep playing is earned by the glass-flake epiphany, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marla’s understanding that her music is “transportation” reweights every prior bridge-song. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern taught by the scaffold-flutter notation and paid off in the reversed melody—though the hitchhiker’s re-materialization is slightly convenient.</comment>

<comment>The mountain pullout is sketched with selective sensory detail—amber evening air, wind carrying new themes—yet it never physically constrains choice. The glass flake and fiddle serve as micro-settings that do charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Marla’s need to understand the hitchhiker’s vanishing—tightens when the glass flake reveals her unforgiven selves. The pressure deepens through her backward-playing choice, with the cost being the irreversible knowledge that she must forever ferry others; escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of self-forgiveness emerges organically from the pixelated amnesty image; no moralizing statement intrudes. The final image of “doorways waiting for the right melody” offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights every bridge she’s played.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“notes scattered like silver light”—with a perceptual signature rooted in musical metaphor. Compression and elision are taught early (“dissolved like morning frost”) and remain legible at closure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, each sentence layering image and idea; only minor scaffold (“she’d seen such patterns… dismissed them”) loops. No mixed metaphors or purple patches mar the climax; rhythm accelerates naturally under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of bridge-songs as literal transportation, pixelated self-forgiveness, and scaffold-flutter notation feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risk-taking in the magical-realist frame heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; no derivative echoes detected.</comment>
