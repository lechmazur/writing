<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kira’s barefoot stance and inherited opera glasses anchor her in tactile memory; the humming stones externalize her interior shift from exhausted observer to resonant conductor. The awkward confidence is embodied—bare toes gripping steel, off-balance grace—rather than labeled. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: she forfeits the safety of private grief to become the circle’s amplifier. One slip: the grandmother’s backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, muting the inherited motive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (rust, starlight, hum) thickens until the circle reweights the rebellion’s pause into inhalation. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Kira’s decision to “bring the others” crystallizes new stakes with felt cost (the private sanctuary ends). Orientation is swift; causality is lyric rather than linear, taught by pattern and paid off in the final image. Minor drift: the archaeologists’ notes are off-stage exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The repair bay’s broken skylights and half-assembled engines are not backdrop but resonators; every abandoned tool vibrates to the circle’s frequency, constraining Kira’s choice to use them as amplifiers. The barefoot contact with cold steel and stone grounds the cosmic stakes in bodily risk. Specificity is selective—no catalog, only the textures that serve the hum. Final image: the forgotten engine coughs to life, proving the setting has agency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to reignite a stalled rebellion—tightens when the circle’s hum offers a non-violent frequency. Escalation is accretive: each pulse deepens the cost of keeping the discovery private. The decisive turn is Kira’s renunciation of solitude; the price is the sanctuary she enjoyed. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens; coincidence is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the opera glasses’ reprise: revolution as generational song, not single explosion. The circle’s star-maps literalize this inheritance without sermon. Subtext hums in the stones’ silence—older rebellions echo. Final image reframes graffiti and broken promises as orchestral warm-up, not failure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is textured, tactile, and slightly off-kilter—matching Kira’s awkward confidence. Syntax lengthens and breathes with the hum, then tightens at the decision beat. No dialogue, yet the prose carries subtext in every metallic echo. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and symbolic weight without redundancy. Metaphors (cathedral of rust, thunderous serenity) are precise and earned. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with scene pulse. One mixed metaphor—“exhaustion dressed as peace”—is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: pre-colonial stone circle as revolutionary tuning fork inside a rusted spaceport. The opera glasses transform from nostalgic relic to cosmic lens. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final engine cough. No derivative echoes; the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
