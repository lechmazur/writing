<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied; the medium’s contradictory impulses (protection vs. connection) are dramatized through micro-choices like pressing the shard and touching the window. The final renunciation of silence is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost—the shard’s dissolution. Minor slip: “armor she’d built around her gift” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the apology is spoken into dream-space, the shard crumbles, and the mother’s stance crystallizes with felt cost. Causal chain holds: shard summons spirits → windows reveal unsent letters → message sent via dream → shard spent. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mangrove labyrinth and singing spirits are rendered with selective sensory detail that guides choice—spirits literally carry the message. The shard functions as micro-setting that constrains the final act (it must be destroyed to release the apology). One minor drift: “moonlight pooled like mercury” is lovely but slightly generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she speak the apology—tightens when the third window forces her to confront the exact withheld words. Escalation is causal: each window narrows her options until the only remaining path is to send the dream-message. Cost is legible in the shard’s dissolution and the irrevocable exposure of her fear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability versus protection emerges organically from the medium’s choices; the final image of dust in her hand reweights the gargoyle’s original purpose (channeling storms) into a metaphor for channeling fear away from love. No moralizing—resonance arises from the particulars of Marina’s lullaby and the shard’s fate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature is consistent—spirits “breathed against the water’s surface,” condensation “settled on invisible windows.” Syntax modulates with pressure: longer sentences in reflection, clipped fragments at the climax. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored to the medium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and patterned (shard as channel, moonlight as mender). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. One mixed metaphor—“time folded backward” followed by “space expanded, elastic”—is minor and does not cloud the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Familiar mother-daughter estrangement is transformed through the specific triangulation of gargoyle shard, singing spirits, and unsent letters. The synthesis feels inevitable: a guardian stone becomes a conduit for apology. Risky lyric mode is sustained without gimmickry; closure remains legible.</comment>
