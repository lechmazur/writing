<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s interiority is specific and embodied—“trembled with cautious exuberance,” “laughed, a sound both nervous and exhilarated”—and her micro-choice to risk mistranslation rather than repeat failed caution is credible. The arc from isolated scholar to bearer of restored harmony is earned; the only gap is that her flaws remain more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the manuscript and ink well glow, the summit looms, and the cost—her sleepless seven nights and the gamble of public revelation—is felt. Causal lens holds: each beat (recognition, translation, ink response) tightens toward the summit fork. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The archive’s dust-thick air and pearl-shimmer ink are selective, sensorily rich, and directly constrain her choices (ink glows only when truth is exact). The micro-setting of the ink well itself functions as environment that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent war by restoring mutual understanding—is signaled early and escalates through one decisive deepening: the ink’s glow confirms her translation will work, tightening the summit countdown. Cost is visible in exhaustion and the public gamble.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: language as living covenant, silence as broken instrument. The final image of “tuning fork, struck clear and true” offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the ink’s pearl-light carries the weight of sincerity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“symphonies of truth,” “carefully reckless”—and stays within Elena’s scholarly lexicon. Rhythmic control under pressure: short, breathless clauses during discovery, longer cadences in reflection. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances knowledge or stakes. Figurative language is sparse enough to avoid clutter, and the final “tuning fork” metaphor lands clean. No loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The extinct promise-language that binds reality is a fresh, non-obvious frame; the ink well’s pearl-ink that glows at truth is a specific, irreplicable device. Risk-taking in the lyric mode pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
