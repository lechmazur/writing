<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coachman’s layered motive—memorializing by erasure—drives every micro-choice; the embodied ritual of pressing seeds into shrapnel-charged soil crystallizes his contradictory role as both undertaker and midwife. Interiority stays concrete via sensory translation of gull-calls into planting sites. Final renunciation (leaving the garden to grow unseen) costs him witness and legacy, earned by prior scenes of linguistic communion with the dead.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers fertility onto violence until the closing image reweights the battlefield as soil. Closure is a Charged Poise—coachman walks away while seeds split, a visible foreclosing of human memory. Orientation anchored by twilight jetty within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Jetty, reef bones, and salt-sweet air constrain planting choices; the rotting planks and phosphorus water literally feed the seeds. Micro-setting of the satchel’s rattling pods functions as extension of character body. Final image of stars above/below mirrored water charges the “narrow vastness” motif with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will war’s memory be erased by garden—tightens as seeds are pressed into shrapnel. One decisive deepening: coachman accepts invisibility of outcome, paying the price of erasure. Escalation is accretive fertility replacing violence; no external coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of forgetting as mercy emerges through action: seeds digesting metal, language loss enabling new growth. Subtext in gull-calls and extinct tongues reframes violence as compost. Final image of “especially fertile soil” offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is archaic, precise, and sensory—coachman’s lexicon of dead languages colors perception. Rhythm modulates from ritual cadence to quiet release. No dialogue; internal monologue stays character-bound. Distinct perceptual signature: translating bird-calls into planting maps.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“pods rattled like old bones”) serves texture without clutter. No loops or scaffold. Sentence variety mirrors emotional arc—long incantatory lines compress to stark final walk. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fusion of post-war ecological reclamation with linguistic necromancy feels fresh and inevitable. Transformation test fails if coachman or seed types swapped. Risk in using extinct languages pays off by charging the garden’s amnesia with cultural cost. No derivative echoes.</comment>
