<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers moving with the deliberate care of someone threading memories through needle eyes”), but the alchemist’s contradictory impulses remain implicit; her final smile and walk home feel earned yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the completed brass plate reconfigures the world’s hidden cartography with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases until the final collapse—yet one causal beat (uncorking the first vial) could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Subarctic crater, inverted trees, and crystallized flash-paper are rendered with tactile specificity; the orchard’s slow heartbeat constrains timing and charges the final map. Spatial choreography is flawless, anchoring every object placement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate the crater’s pulse into a portable map—tightens through each placement and uncorking. Agency is present but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally paid; pressure deepens rather than narrows live options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of mapping impossible geographies emerges organically from the alchemist’s patient labor; the final image of “directions to everywhere that shouldn’t exist” reweights all prior debris into resonant cartography without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the alchemist’s patience (“slow as growing crystals”). Perceptual signature is distinct; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“mercury made of dawn”) risk overwriting yet serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances pattern or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy, cartography, and inverted arboreal physics; the conceit of flash-paper preserving starlight feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure pays off in a resonant final image.</comment>
