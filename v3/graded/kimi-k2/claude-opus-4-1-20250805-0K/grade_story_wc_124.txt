<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her grief and transformation are anchored in sensory detail and micro-choices (uncorking the vial, recorking it). The shift from broker to living archive is earned through the perfume’s catalytic action and her mother’s legacy. One slip: “understood what she was becoming” edges toward diagnostic summary rather than embodied discovery, keeping it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s tear-charged perception reweights the greenhouse from empty to haunted-garden, with the cost of perpetual grief-as-archive. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each scent layer deepens density until the final crystallization. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. A hairline slip: the lantern’s “shouldn’t exist” flowers are revealed late, though the mother’s authorship retroactively justifies them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse, lantern glass, and perfume vial function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the vial’s scent forces transformation, the lantern’s hidden flowers foreclose sale. Sensory specificity is selective—ultraviolet roots, opalescent shimmer—filtered through Elara’s professional eye. One minor drift: “crystal shadows” recurs without fresh inflection near the end, blunting the final image’s charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to metabolize grief into purpose—tightens when the perfume catalyzes irreversible transformation. Agency is present: uncorking the vial is a decisive act with visible cost (tears, permanent olfactory archive). Escalation is accumulative; each extinct scent deepens the irreversible shift. The price is felt but could be sharper—no concrete forfeiture beyond perpetual sensitivity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation as grief’s luminous twin. The refrain “Some things must be lost to be truly held” is earned through the mother’s archive and Elara’s tear-translation. No moralizing; the final image of invisible garden blooming in darkness reweights the premise without dictating meaning. Subtext in the lantern’s unsold status quietly signals maternal foresight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled compression (“trafficking in the light of lost things”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices scent spectra and crystalline refractions. Syntax modulates with emotional crests; no head-hopping. One near-slip: “understood now” momentarily lifts to explanatory register, but recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, memory, and light. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (“tears weren’t endings but translations”). Rhythm breathes with the perfume waves. Minor register drift: “conceptual integrity” in Q8 note is evaluator language, not story flaw—text itself stays clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of olfactory memory, starlight preservation, and tear-activated archive feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (extinct flowers, memory vial) are transformed through Elara’s specific grief and her mother’s lantern craft. Risk in lyric density pays off; closure remains legible. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
