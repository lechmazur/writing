<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—tasting memories, hiding the seed in her mouth—yet the “informally wise” label is asserted rather than dramatized. Her final stance crystallizes with felt cost (“Let them try to burn this down”), but the contradiction between gentle rebellion and absolute certainty is not embodied in a micro-choice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the neural garden becomes living memory-art that reweights the Ministry’s forgetting. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each remembered fragment layers density until the greenhouse itself is reconfigured. Cost is legible in the dawn image: Mira’s quiet acceptance that destruction would only seed deeper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is not backdrop; its broken panes and vines constrain pruning choices and later host the neural network. Synapse-shaped rust blooms charge the final image, making the setting indispensable to closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve memory against forced forgetting—is signaled early and tightened through the triple-moon deadline. One decisive intensification: the seed sprouts horizontally, foreclosing secrecy and exposing the garden to discovery. Cost is visible in Mira’s acceptance of inevitable reprisal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as subversive beauty. The final image of breathing-in memories offers a non-literal answer—revolution via shared sensation—without moralizing. Subtext operates in synaptic rust patterns and the quiet “beauty from ruins” refrain that reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in gustatory perception; “taste the memories” is taught early and paid off. Syntax modulates with pressure—short declaratives during sprouting, longer reflective cadences in stillness. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored to Mira’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers sensory or emotional information. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (rust as synapses, memories as honey) are coherent and purposeful. Rhythm accelerates during the sprouting sequence, then settles into a charged poise at dawn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of culinary craft, neural botany, and quiet rebellion feels fresh and inevitable. The knowledge-fruit seed transformed into a horizontal neural garden is a specific, non-obvious payoff that grows from established rules. Risk-taking (synaptic greenhouse graffiti) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
