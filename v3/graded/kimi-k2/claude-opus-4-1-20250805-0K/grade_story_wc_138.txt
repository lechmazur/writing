<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vex’s immortal fatigue and her hunger for “what happens after goodbye” are embodied in the tactile handling of the amulet; the final step through the door feels earned because her millennia of boredom and the fragment’s pull have been dramatized, not declared. Interior contradiction is present—she both clings to existence and longs for its end—but the pivot from observer to participant could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the fused amulet opens a quiet door and two immortals step through, foreclosing eternal stasis at visible cost (“leaving the prismatic escondite empty”). Causality under a Causal lens holds—each beat because/therefore links the storm, the fragments, and the final crossing without gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The escondite’s crystalline walls bend light and gravity in ways that directly shape tactics—Vex threads magnetic field lines through translucent barriers to admit Thorne. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; the solar storm’s charged particles act as both clock and cover, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape immortal imprisonment—is signaled early and tightened once: the fragments’ reunion narrows options from passive observation to irreversible crossing. Cost is legible in the emptying of the sanctuary and the amulet’s final hum, though the price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: immortality as cage, death as undiscovered country. The amulet’s reassembly reweights the premise from curse to key; the final image of the vacant escondite offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to “what happens after goodbye.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—measured, ancient, faintly sardonic (“even auroras… had become mundane”). Compression and lyric patterning are consistent; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-laden (“We know you’re watching”) and advances the plot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; metaphors serve rather than stall. Occasional stacked modifiers (“sheets of electromagnetic fury”) flirt with excess but never obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar tropes—immortal ennui, cursed artifact, dimensional mutiny—are reconfigured through the prismatic escondite and the quiet door beyond death. The synthesis feels specific and inevitable; risk is taken in the understated ending rather than spectacle.</comment>
