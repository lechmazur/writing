<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sarah’s prosopagnosia and artistic method are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (charcoal gradients, ribbon on finger) that reveal interior contradiction; the final renunciation—portraits as evidence—carries visible cost. Interiority stays embodied, never diagnostic. One slip: “seventeen proofs” edges toward summary label in the last paragraph, blunting the earned edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the circle of portraits reweights the premise from “find masks” to “recognize fractures,” with the quarry’s lifting mist charging the cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each portrait adds density until the composite mind emerges. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. Only the phone call feels slightly tacked on, not fully woven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Limestone walls, ribbon, charcoal dust, and mist are filtered through Sarah’s tactile bias; the quarry’s geometry constrains easel placement and sight lines. Final image of “cupped hands holding water” recharges the mist motif. Weather and stone subtly mirror internal fragmentation without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the killer’s logic—tightens via each portrait’s revelation of duality; the seventeenth portrait crystallizes the killer as composite self. Pressure escalates through pattern accumulation rather than causal turns, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in Sarah’s trembling hand and the final renunciation of conventional evidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of fractured identity seeking dangerous unity emerges organically from portraits and quarry shadows; no moralizing. Final image of “seventeen proofs that we are all divided selves” offers resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in ribbon’s silk weave and charcoal’s dust layers deepens without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and filtered through Sarah’s haptic perception: “charcoal moved in measured strokes,” “texture and movement.” No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“lancing through private vice like light through prisms”) is earned by artistic POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and insight. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors stay coherent: “architecture of a shattered mind.” Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrase, but it fits the final conceptual turn.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: face-blind detective who paints masks to see identity fractures. Tropes of serial-killer profiler and abandoned quarry are transformed through tactile art process. Risky accumulative structure pays off in final composite image. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
