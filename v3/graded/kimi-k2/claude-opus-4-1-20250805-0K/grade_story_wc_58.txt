<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—writing others’ living obituaries while clinging to the thread’s map of healing—are embodied through micro-choices: winding thread round her wrist, recording Marcus’s ghost-vigil. Her interior contradiction crystallizes in “understanding the precise topography of loss”; the final refusal (renouncing closure for others) carries on-page cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story holds an Accumulative/Textural lens: threads pulled → pattern beneath → renunciation. Closure’s Earned Stasis (“she was its humble cartographer”) arrives with visible (felt) cost of perpetual witness. Occasional orientational blur (“three autumns ago”) is forgiven because it feeds the dreamy cadence and reweights final poise.</comment>

<comment>Garden shadows, frost-edged roses, dry basin—details anchor who/where and evolve from passive backdrop to charged constraint: frost “that would never quite commit to killing them” mirrors Elara’s own refusal to finish Marcus’s story. The thread itself becomes micro-setting; its pulse against her wrist constrains the final cartographic act.</comment>

<comment>Stake: the obligation to map absent but living grief. Pressure tightens once when Elara “prepare[s] to weave their endings into something that might, perhaps, resemble peace,” trading resolution for ongoing witness. The cost—perpetual custodianship—is legible in her synchronized heartbeat with the crimson pulse.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from particular absences and threads; “healing was not a destination but a map” is earned via Marcus’s translucent walk and Elara’s renunciatory act. Ends with non-literal wisdom: “the garden held its breath… while Marcus counted stars.” Avoids moralizing statement; the emotional afterimage lingers in silence.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The lyric third-person close voice remains disciplined: perceptual signature is Elara’s slow synesthetic noticing (“pulling a single crimson weft thread between her fingers”). No unmotivated head-hopping; compression and ellipses (“merchant ship slipped beyond…”) are patterned early and legible by closure.</comment>

<comment>Prose sings: “shadows pooled… absence now a kind of presence” is vivid and new. Occasional lyric layering (“lonesome splendor of endings”) risks slight purple but stays just shy of overcooked. Zero scaffold loops; rhythm modulates with scene urgency and no closure-blotting artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: obituary writer for the living, cartographer of unmourned presence. The transformation test holds—“pulling the palace carpet apart thread by thread” is irreproducible word-for-word. A sliver of thematic echo (“map of healing”) trends template-adjacent but is overtaken by specificity of Marcus counting long-dead starlight.</comment>
