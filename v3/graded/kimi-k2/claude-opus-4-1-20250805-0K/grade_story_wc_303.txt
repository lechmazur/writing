<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—career ambition vs moral duty—play out in real time; the choice to forge papers while encoding truth is a sharp micro-choice that costs her the empire she coveted. Interiority is specific (mulberry-wine taste of the lie, jasmine’s whisper) and embodied. The final renunciation feels earned because the violin’s justice mechanism was seeded early and her flaw (over-cleverness) drives the trap she sets for Marcus.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the violin’s sublimation rewrites the Chen legacy forever, cost etched in nightly dreams. Causal chain holds—because Elara forges papers, therefore Marcus touches the violin, therefore the curse ignites. Orientation is swift (velvet drapes, bruised twilight) and the single-scene default is respected. No teleporting props or retro patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory’s velvet darkness and ice-cold violin constrain every move; the jasmine vine literally whispers stakes. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Elara notices temperature, transparency, plant telepathy—never tourist catalog. Final image of evaporating ice reflecting alien stars recharges the opening constellation charts, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs career—tightens when the coffee stains reveal genocide; the forgery is the irreversible act that narrows options. Escalation is causal: each beat (research, offer, lie, touch) raises the cost until the violin’s wail makes the price undeniable. No coincidence resolves the conflict; agency is Elara’s throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the specific theft of the ice-singers’ music; no abstract sermonizing. Subtext in Marcus’s “Have you reconsidered?” carries dynastic guilt. Final image—stars reflected in meltwater—offers a non-literal answer: some legacies dissolve so memory can survive. Moral complexity lingers; Elara’s victory is also her exile from the academy she wanted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet precise: “mulberry wine, sweet and bitter” matches Elara’s sensibility. No head-hopping; POV stays locked. Compression like “bruised twilight” teaches the color palette early and pays off in the final “mulberry blood.” Dialogue is sparse but subtext-rich; Marcus’s three words carry generational weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical without purple drift; every line advances stakes or atmosphere. Metaphors are coherent (ice sings, velvet absorbs sound). No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm modulates with tension. The final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the violin’s fading note, a deliberate echo that charges closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Ice-singers of Thule, plant telepathy, and coffee-stain prophecy synthesize into a fresh mythos that feels inevitable. The violin’s self-activating justice is a non-obvious twist grown from established rules. Specificity—jasmine’s whisper, mulberry ache—prevents generic fantasy gloss. Risky lyric compression pays off in the resonant final image.</comment>
