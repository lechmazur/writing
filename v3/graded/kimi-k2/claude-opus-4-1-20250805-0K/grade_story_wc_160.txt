<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is specific—her tremble, the chain’s history, the mask-of-pragmatism credo—but the elders and youth remain off-page abstractions, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is muted. Her contradictory impulse (cruel kindness) is dramatized in the carved plans and the anonymous note, earning the renunciation of credit with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the anonymous note and carved plans crystallize a new interdependence while the cost—Mara’s deliberate self-erasure—is felt. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of breathing stones, chain, resin converge in a final image that reweights the entire premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The amphitheater’s thermal breathing and volcanic husk constrain Mara’s stealth and timing; the chain and mixed-resin envelope act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory selection (stone lungs, brass links, resin scent) is filtered through her engineer’s bias and braided into action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconcile water rights without open war—tightens when Mara’s “purely technical” plan forces collaboration via dual-operator gates. The cost is her anonymity and the risk of discovery; escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, sufficient for 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of encrypted compassion emerges from the resin-mix envelope and the hidden irrigation logic; no moralizing statement intrudes. The final image of water remembering how to flow together offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—engineer’s tactile precision, volcanic breathing as meditation rhythm, slyly heartfelt diction (“dappled resolve,” “star-drunk night”). No dialogue, so compression and lyric elision are taught early and paid off in the closure cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density; figurative language is selective and patterned (stone lungs, encrypted compassion). No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with heat expansion and night exhalation. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized,” “interdependence”) stays within Mara’s reflective register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Floodgate diplomacy disguised as engineering, volcanic amphitheater as living council chamber, resin-mix envelope as cryptographic key—each synthesis feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking (anonymous benefactor, non-confrontational resolution) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
