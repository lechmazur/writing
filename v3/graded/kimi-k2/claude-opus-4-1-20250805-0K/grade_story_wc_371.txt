<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“smelling of rosemary and time”), but the final epiphany—“her strange gift…was not madness but ministry”—leans toward diagnostic label-speak rather than earned contradiction. Micro-choices (planting seeds, accepting tea) align with motive, yet the cost of her new vocation is asserted more than dramatized. Still, the grandmother’s eyes and the seeds in Lila’s palm give a tactile, character-specific anchor that forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lila’s stance crystallizes when she accepts perpetual guardianship of hidden gardens, with the cost of lifelong attention. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each impossible breadcrumb thickens pattern until the tea house materializes. Orientation is swift; causality is lyric rather than linear, taught early by “reality bent in small, merciful ways.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The jasmine hedge, thornrose gap, and candle-lit tea house are rendered with sensory economy; the palace wall and ghost-echo birds constrain Lila’s path and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the courtyard’s decay-to-abundance arc mirrors interior stakes. One slip: “birds flying south, though autumn had long since passed” could be sharper in temporal cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—tending unseen sacredness—tightens when Lila realizes attention itself is the price. One clear deepening: accepting seeds means perpetual vigilance. Cost is felt but lightly; the grandmother’s smile softens the bite. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: witness as sacrament. Subtext lives in gesture—the bread uncloaking memories, the seeds pressed into skin. Final image of bread tasting “of forgiveness and time” reweights all prior anomalies without moralizing. Complexity lingers: is Lila blessed or burdened?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded; perceptual signature is Lila’s synesthetic noticing (“shadows that fell upward”). Syntax modulates with wonder and fatigue. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays clean. Dialogue is spare but carries subtext: “You’re the gardener,” not asking.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, texture, or motion. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“heuristic kindness”) fits the fabulist register. Metaphors are coherent: bread as anchor, gardens as doors. Final cadence slows to crystallize cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fabulist premise feels inevitable: guerrilla gardens as portals for displaced sacred. Tropes (ghost bread, secret tea house) are transformed through Lila’s tactile stewardship. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. No close echoes; synthesis is singular.</comment>
