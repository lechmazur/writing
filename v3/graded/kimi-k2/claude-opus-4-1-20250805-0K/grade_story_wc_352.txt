<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orin’s prism-mind and archivist vocation are vividly embodied; the final choice to seed new warnings is earned by the grotto ordeal. Interiority is specific, but the “civilization’s immune system” line edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Orin’s return to the desk with new purpose carries felt cost. Causal chain from doodle map → grotto → memory node → reentry knowledge holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One minor ellipsis: how Orin exits the grotto as gravity rights itself is elided but not disruptive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto’s mist, inverted water, and crystal nodes are rendered with tactile specificity and directly constrain navigation and discovery. The “fossilized throat” image recharges the final sense of swallowed danger. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite gravity flip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the hidden combination before gravity normalizes—is signaled early and tightened when the largest node’s obscured memory forces a mnemonic burn. Cost is visible: the knowledge sears into Orin’s mind. No extraneous reversals; pressure stays coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of custodial vigilance emerges organically from the grotto memories and Orin’s final act of drawing new warnings. The ending image of faintly glowing ink reweights the doodles from map to legacy without moralizing. Complexity is honored: knowledge must neither die nor run rampant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is dense, lyrical, and consistent with an archivist’s prism-perception; phrases like “threshold effects” and “probability streams” feel native to the POV. Rhythm modulates under stress—short clauses during inversion, longer ruminative sentences in the node flash. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive and information-dense; figurative language is selective (“water droplets fell upward like silver rain”). One scaffold loop: “seeds of vigilance” is repeated in close proximity. Otherwise clean, with no mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The inversion of gravity as archival access, crystalline memory nodes, and luminous blood-ink warnings synthesize familiar fantasy tropes into a fresh custodial myth. The prism-mind gift feels inevitable for the task. Risky structure—lyric accumulation rather than causal plot—pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
