<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Anya’s interiority is vivid—her palm on the waterfall, the ruby’s warmth—but her contradictory impulses (seek power vs. reject it) surface only in summary. The final renunciation is earned by the mural reveal, yet the cost is more conceptual than embodied; we feel awe, not personal loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the throne is understood as a deliberate unclaimable monument, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the quest. Causal chain is thin—mural simply appears—but under an Accumulative/Textural lens the pattern of seeded fragments holds. Sunrise deadline tightens the final listening beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The orchard’s bioluminescent leaves and singing bark are sensuous and specific, anchoring Terra-9. Yet the setting constrains choice only atmospherically; the shed interior matters more. Final image of glowing roots recharges the orchard as keeper of memory, nudging toward 8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find the stairway”—is signaled early and reframed by the mural’s revelation. Pressure tightens once: the sunrise triggers the orchard’s song, forcing Anya to choose interpretation over possession. Cost is intellectual surrender of power, visible in her quiet sitting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of democratic restraint emerges organically from murals and song; no explicit moralizing. The unclaimed throne as anti-monument resonates without being named. Final image of dissolved ruby seeding collective memory offers non-literal answer: ascend by refusing to sit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical-scientific (“kaleidoscopic waterfall,” “chromium oxide signature”) consistent with a lore keeper. Compression and elision are purposeful; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates from wonder to hushed revelation, supporting the tonal shift at dawn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet propulsive; occasional stacked modifiers (“genetically modified bark resonating with harmonic frequencies”) flirt with excess but stay tethered to sensory immediacy. No loops or scaffold. Final paragraph’s cadence slows gracefully to mirror Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The conceit of a throne designed to remain empty, encoded in scattered data seeds, feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes of lost colony and hidden map are transformed through democratic refusal. Risky lyric structure pays off in the orchard’s dawn song.</comment>
