<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s embodied somatic compass and willowglass hope are vivid, contradictory, and drive every micro-choice; David’s skepticism softens through tactile wonder, creating a crucible that alters their bond. The static-shock backstory is anchored in present gel-powder action and tilts her stance without summary overload. Cost is felt when she risks permanent exposure of hidden pathways. Minor slip: David’s interiority is slightly ventriloquized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene; orientation (who/where/when) is clear by line 3. Causal lens holds: recalled pills → revelation of pathways → studio demonstration → David’s participatory shift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—light corridors crystallize empathy’s architecture with felt social cost: pharmaceutical secrecy exposed. No teleporting props or causal gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Studio’s prismatic light and muscovite refractions are not backdrop but active constraint—beam angles must be adjusted to bodily tingles. Micro-setting of geode sliver and projector tether every gesture. Sensory hierarchy favors light/heat over visual catalog. Final image recharges the opening fractal motif, constraining the closing stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reveal hidden empathic pathways despite FDA recall. Tightening occurs when Maya crushes pill mid-scene—risk of exposure escalates. Agency is hers; David’s wonder is earned consequence, not coincidence. Cost is social/professional jeopardy legible in “recalled” context.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: empathy as tangible architecture, not slogan. Subtext in David’s hand on shoulder shifting from restraint to participatory wonder. Final image refracts earlier fractals, reweighting premise without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers in pharmaceutical fallout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s perceptual signature—somatic tingles guide syntax. No head-hopping; David’s awe is filtered through her goosebumps. Diction is precise yet lyrical (“fractally precise reflections,” “willowglass hope”) without purple drift. Rhythm modulates with projector adjustments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density—each sentence advances light, body, or stakes. Metaphors are coherent (geode splitting light into “impossible geometries”). No filter-verb stacks. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: telepathy pills as empathy revelation, not mind-reading; muscovite as connective mineral; light painting as pedagogy. Risky concept committed fully; transformation test passes—story collapses without these specifics. No derivative echoes.</comment>
