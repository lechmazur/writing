<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s whimsical tinker persona is sketched in adjective clusters; interiority is lyrical but generic, not bespoke to her quirks. The climactic choice—hum instead of tinker—is believable yet telegraphed by the premise. Contradictory impulses (faith vs rationalism) aren’t dramatized on-body.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens selected; resonance builds through iterative song-planting. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the communal singing re-configures meaning with a felt return-of-tradition cost. Orientation is cleanly anchored early, no orientation penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arbor atmosphere is sensorial but broad; dew, gold leaf, and moonbeam read as set pieces rather than pressure agents. The resurgent vine itself finally constrains the closing ritual, barely meeting the 9+ gate requirement, so capped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore the ritual or it stays hollow”—is clear and escalates toward the moon’s rise. Tension grows by accumulating voices joining Elara, not by a single beat reversal. Cost is communal catharsis; no further tightening feels missing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of cultural memory revived through sound emerges organically; no moralizing finale weakens punch. Subtext glimmers in villagers’ wordless gathering, but the thematic aftertaste remains gently generic rather than piercing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Sensuous, elevated diction evokes folklore without slipping into purple overload. Rhythm modulates well between hush and communal swell. Single POV holds cleanly; free-indirect style is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Metaphoric phrasing occasionally loops (“hush that preceded sunrise echoes the gathering hush...”), creating micro-scaffold. Dense lyrical sentences never obscure action order or fracture clarity, yet sap crisp momentum in two places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Plant-resurrection via song is not conceptually novel, but the integration of craft identity with non-craft ritual feels fresh. Emotional specificity grounds it against genre clichés, but transformation isn’t stark enough for higher rungs.</comment>
