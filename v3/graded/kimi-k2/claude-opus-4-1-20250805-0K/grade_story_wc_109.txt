<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied—"ambered hush" and "flaking gold leaf booklet" act as tactile extensions of her obsession. Yet the final realization (“the star would not die tonight”) is narrated rather than dramatized, softening the cost of her endurance. No contradictory impulse is shown in-scene; she simply accepts delay, so the renunciation feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: she redefines the endless night as process, not destination. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of silences thickens until meaning reweights. Cost is subtle but legible: she shoulders another cycle of lonely vigil. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Storm-battered fort, crumbling parapet, and dying star are vividly selective, filtered through her vigil. The booklet’s flakes and the cliff’s tremors ground the metaphysical stakes. Environment doesn’t alter tactics, but it charges the final image of descent into wind that “had returned to their fury,” tightening the cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the final darkness—remains coherent. Pressure tightens once: the expected extinction stalls, forcing patience. Agency is endurance, but the visible price (another night of isolation) is understated; escalation is more cadence shift than causal narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mapping absence is itself an act of presence. Subtext lives in the booklet’s decay and the star’s refusal to cooperate. Final image of “another page waited to be filled” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“marbled hush,” “grammar of things that were no longer there.” Syntax mirrors her slowed perception; no head-hop or register drift. Patterned elision (“to retell…by summarizing silence”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Metaphors stay coherent—“ambered hush” remains sticky, not decorative. Minor filter verbs (“she could feel”) are rare and voice-motivated. No loops or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Premise—astronomer of extinction via silence—is fresh and fully committed. Familiar tropes (lone watcher, dying star) are transformed through the booklet’s archaeology of darkness. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
