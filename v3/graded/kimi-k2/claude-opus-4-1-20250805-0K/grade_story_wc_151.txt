<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her chalk choices embody her client’s unspoken longing—but the final beat is a gentle smile rather than a choice that costs her anything. The “careful invention” trait is shown, not told, yet the arc is observational, not transformational. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (turquoise, amber, brass, marble) tightens the mood until the final photograph reweights the whole ritual. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mira locks the gate, foreclosing the night’s work with the felt cost of impermanence (“rain will wash it away”). Orientation is swift and coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The golden arcade’s brass and skylight light constrain Mira’s ritual footprint; the chalk code sprawls only where cameras once watched, making the empty mall a silent witness. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her professional eye. The setting’s nostalgia charges the final image as she smiles at tomorrow’s erasure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Stakes are the private act of naming another soul before dawn; pressure tightens as trucks warm up, but the beat is more atmospheric than decisive. Agency is present—she chooses the symbols, photographs the code—but the cost is conceptual (impermanence) rather than tactical. Escalation is a single cadence shift, sufficient under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from the friction between authentic and performed identity, crystallized in the chalk constellation that is both true and false. The final image of tomorrow’s rain erasing the code offers a resonant, non-moral answer: connection is made precious by its inevitable vanishing. No overt thesis; complexity is honored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to texture and light (“brass fixtures catching the first light like memories of a future that never quite arrived”). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Compression is purposeful and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical without purple overload; metaphors are coherent and grounded. Occasional filter verbs (“she could hear”) are minimal and voice-motivated. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or character. A few elevated phrases (“conceptual repricing”) nudge register but remain within Mira’s reflective lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>The conceit—postal pseudonym artisan in a derelict hologram mall—feels fresh yet inevitable. Children’s chalk as cryptographic medium is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk is taken in the quiet, accumulative structure, and it pays off in the final image of erasure. No close echoes detected.</comment>
