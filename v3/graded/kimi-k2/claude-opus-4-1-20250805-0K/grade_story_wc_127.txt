<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the tension between her professional detachment and the pull to “subsume” gives her contradictory impulses in-scene. The choice not to consume the merchandise is a credible renunciation with felt cost. The widower’s need is told rather than dramatized, slightly blunting the stakes, but her micro-choice at the end—tucking the petal away—reads as earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each petal press deepens the pattern of harvested half-truths until the dusk-seal tightens the stakes. Closure lands as a Charged Poise—Vera’s refusal to absorb the emotions reconfigures her stance with visible cost (“small mercy in a world that often loved too sharply”). Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The amber grotto is rendered with tactile specificity—crystalline walls, static crackle, loosening molecules—that constrains the harvest window and charges the final image. Light-shift and permeability are learned through action, not exposition. The setting’s dusk transformation is the literal timer that forces the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harvesting usable half-truths before the grotto seals—is signaled early and tightens as the petal darkens. One meaningful deepening: the pull to subsume versus the rule never to consume. Cost is felt in the renunciation, though external stakes (the widower) remain off-stage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of merciful incompleteness emerges organically from the harvest process and Vera’s refusal; no explicit moralizing. The final image of “merciful lies that are truer than honesty itself” reweights the premise without stating a thesis. Subtext in the static yearning of severed emotions is effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with controlled rhythm and sensory specificity (“liquid gold,” “static electricity still tingled”). Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off. No dialogue, but the narrative voice remains consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors are fresh and integrated (“amber grotto…pools of liquid gold”). No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“merciful detachment”) stays within Vera’s lexicon. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The counterfeit-emotion premise is transformed through the half-truth mechanic and dusk-grotto specificity. Harvesting partial, authentic feelings feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode is sustained without gimmickry; the concept commits fully.</comment>
