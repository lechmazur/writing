<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific; the brass pull anchors contradictory impulses—vengeance and mercy—under pressure. The micro-choice to hand the pull to Thorne crystallizes her value hierarchy and forecloses easy revenge with visible cost. Reflection is brief, anchored in the object, and tilts her present stance. No slips in motivation or knowledge state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara accepts the apology as “down payment,” foreclosing immediate retaliation while retaining the right to forgive later—cost is the deferred satisfaction. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of inherited object + moon wisdom reweights the stake at the end. Anchors who/where/when within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mist-softened parapet and brass pull together constrain movement and visibility, forcing the intimate, perilous negotiation. Micro-setting (the drawer pull as “setting-in-hand”) directly shapes the final exchange. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara’s urgency. Weather and object jointly charge the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to use the exchange for revenge or wisdom—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: handing over the pull redefines the conflict from retribution to conditional mercy with felt cost (delay of forgiveness). Escalation is textural: the inherited object and moon lore accumulate pressure until the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme of recycling sorrow into wisdom emerges organically from the object’s history and Elara’s choice; no explicit moralizing. The drawer pull’s lineage and moon phases reweight meaning in the final paragraph without statement. Subtext in Thorne’s apology and Elara’s measured response deepens complexity. Resonant aftereffect lingers in the mist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the hush before exchange. Compression (“furrowed hush,” “recycled sorrow”) is taught early and paid off. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot naturally.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances character or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>The inherited brass pull as negotiating talisman is a fresh, non-obvious device; its lineage transforms a familiar prisoner-exchange scene. Synthesis of moon lore, inherited guilt, and conditional mercy feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of object and ritual anchors universals. Risk in quiet lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
