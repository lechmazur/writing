<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elsa’s reticence and comfort in solitude are dramatized through her stone-reading habit and her unhesitating ascent; the final acceptance of guardianship is earned by these traits. Interiority is concrete (“sea glass… pulsing with captured moonlight”). The ghost chorus is sketched lightly yet exerts pressure, keeping cast within scope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elsa’s choice to tend the living and dead reconfigures her life with felt cost—perpetual isolation in the tower. Causal chain holds: letters lure → stones warn → ghosts reveal need → Elsa accepts. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Beacon Point’s dead eye, phosphorescent foam, and the lantern room’s breathing stairs are vivid, selective, and tied to Elsa’s perception. The sea glass and stacked stones act as micro-settings that constrain her final choice. Spatial choreography is clean; weather and darkness pressure the approach.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—loneliness versus guardianship—tightens when the ghosts reveal the lamp was snuffed to force her decision. One clear escalation: lamp relights only when Elsa channels bottled safety, narrowing her future to eternal vigil. Cost is visible in her silent stone message “You are not alone.”</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inverse equation of solitude and service: isolation transmuted into purposeful protection. Subtext lives in stacked stones and the ghosts’ tears. Final image of stones spelling “I am here” offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the loneliness question.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Elsa’s perceptual filter; reticent, observant diction (“worn smooth by decades of tides”) matches her character. No head-hopping; ghost dialogue is filtered through her awareness. Rhythm modulates with tension—short clauses on the stairs, longer reflections in the lantern room.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical, each sentence advancing image or pressure. No loops or scaffold; “the lamp blazed to life, its beam cutting through darkness and death alike” carries double duty. Metaphors are precise and internally consistent. Clean grammar and tense throughout.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar lighthouse-ghost trope is inverted: ghosts seek not rescue but a keeper who can endure solitude without being devoured by it. Stone-message language and bottled safety give fresh specificity. The synthesis feels inevitable—only a reticent, stone-reading skipper could answer their need.</comment>
