<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mae’s interiority is vivid—camera weight on shoulder, copper taste of inherited heartbreak—but the ghost woman’s sudden co-presence dilutes Mae’s agency in the climax; the final renunciation still lands with felt cost, yet the joint pilgrimage muddies whose stakes we’re closing on.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a luminous Conceptual Repricing: Mae’s emptied camera becomes the key that unlocks the repository, reweighting every prior photograph as sacrificial offering. The causal chain—memory → tear → breathing pattern → door—holds cleanly, and the cost (loss of years of captured solitude) is on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The viaduct’s wisteria-choked arches and twilight phosphorescence are not backdrop but aperture: the blooms’ thickness determines where the door appears, and the camera’s wooden body functions as micro-setting that literally frames reality. Sensory selection stays urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where unused love is stored”—is signaled early and tightened when Mae realizes she must give, not take. One clear escalation beat: uncorking the tear narrows options from observation to surrender. Cost is the forfeiture of her archive, visible in the rising ribbons of light.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: love unused is not waste but latent healing energy awaiting release. The final image—Mae walking away “empty and full simultaneously”—reweights every prior photograph as seed rather than souvenir, avoiding any final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with tactile diction (“festooned,” “ground glass,” “compressed starlight”) that stays within Mae’s perceptual range. Rhythm modulates with breathing shifts, and no head-hopping occurs; the ghost’s whisper is filtered through Mae’s understanding, keeping focalization clean.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold, though “like a prayer written in stone” flirts with cliché yet earns its keep by echoing the repository’s sanctity. Metaphors remain coherent and physically legible.</comment>

<comment>The synthesis—camera obscura as spiritual aperture, Kwan Yin’s tear as literalized compassion, repository of unloved moments—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring causality; no derivative templates detected.</comment>
