<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and profession-rooted; her decision to document rather than repair the timer crystallizes her arc. Yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral—no embodied price is shown on the page. Contradictory impulses (fix vs. preserve) are present but lightly dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of reflected images tightens toward the final “blueprint of malfunction.” Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara’s ascent with tomorrow’s echo confirms the path foreclosed. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The marble cavern and its quartz veins are tactile, mirrored, and time-bending; the mirrored surfaces literally constrain how Mara interacts with the timer. Light, echo, and water function as micro-settings that shape tactics. Final image of the timer left “in its marble cradle” recharges the setting’s hold on her.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserving wonder by chronicling its escape—is signaled early and deepens as Mara chooses documentation over repair. Pressure tightens once: the wounded season’s end forces the choice. Cost is conceptual (loss of direct wonder) but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of wonder leaking through cracks in reason emerges organically from the timer’s broken state and Mara’s refusal to seal it. Final image reweights the premise: damage as revelation. No moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and slightly arcane—“marble cavern,” “temporal locks,” “camera obscura”—all filtered through Mara’s locksmith perception. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“frozen lightning,” “wonder leaked through cracks”) is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances. Occasional elevated diction fits the reflective mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of time-harvesting via antique locksmith craft; the broken timer as prism for wonder is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risky temporal mechanics are taught early and paid off at closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
