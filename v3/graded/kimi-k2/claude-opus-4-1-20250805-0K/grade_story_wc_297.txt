<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s root-bound trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices (pressing the clipping, tracing scars) and drives her to anchor the timeline; the final “roots and wings” crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost. Interiority is specific, but the future-self mirror beat edges toward convenient exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira signs the covenant, sealing the intersection and foreclosing her old fixed-point life. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat adds density until the maze blooms. Cost is legible in the last line’s irreversible fusion of roots and flight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt glade’s blue grass and light-shifted dusk are selective, sensory, and purpose-built; the living maze grown from the clipping constrains Mira’s final gesture. Spatial choreography is clean, and the environment evolves causally with each root that stitches scar to sky.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Dominant stake—repair the eclipsed covenant—tightens once: the maze’s growth forces Mira to accept eternal anchorship. Pressure intensifies through pattern accumulation rather than causal turns; the cost is the loss of unrooted freedom, felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Theme of rootedness as both cage and conduit emerges from concrete actions; the final image reweights “root-bound” from limitation to transcendence without moralizing. Subtext operates in scars and silver cat’s-cradle light, inviting reflection on time’s sutures.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and consistent—compressed diction under pressure (“electricity through water”) without purple drift. POV stays tightly interior; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature in scar-reading and plant-touching metaphors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned early (blue grass like sapphires) and paid off in the starlight signature. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Minor elevated register (“luminous covenant”) stays within Mira’s visionary lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of quantum-future bleed and botanical magic feels inevitable; the root-bound visionary trope is inverted into cosmic anchor. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Fresh inflection: scars as readable braille across time.</comment>
