<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is textured and embodied; the “preemptively nostalgic” trait drives her micro-choice to write memory into crystal. The final stance—choosing to archive the present as it vanishes—earns its cost by the prior realization that every moment is already memory. The single POV holds without drift; no second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lyra’s act of writing crystallizes the survivors’ future identity while accepting perpetual loss. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each remembered image layers density until the final cadence reweights the premise. Causality is lyric but legible; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory, crystal pillars, and fog-stone below are vivid, selective, and filter through Lyra’s archivist gaze. The crystals and lightning constrain the only viable action—memory preservation—charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving human identity via shared memory—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: Lyra shifts from observer to active archivist, foreclosing passive nostalgia. Cost is felt in the irrevocable loss of the world below. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: identity is sculpted from collective experience, not grand history but quiet wonder. The final image of survivors gathering to “become” by remembering offers resonant, non-moral reweighting. No thematic echo in final paragraph; complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture: “summer-quill,” “fog-stone,” “alabaster seas” create perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in closure cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sensory detail is integrated into action; no filler. Final third remains clean, supporting 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Fog-stone and memory-crystal synthesis feels inevitable and fresh. Premise transforms familiar “last sanctuary” trope through specificity of archivist vocation and preemptive nostalgia. Risk in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
