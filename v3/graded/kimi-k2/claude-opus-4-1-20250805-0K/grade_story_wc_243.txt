<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—duty to truth vs mercy to Eleanor—drives every micro-choice; the codicil beat crystallizes her hierarchy of values with visible cost (stained fingers, locket left behind). Flawed compassion feels earned, not declared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant handed over is simultaneously act of grace and act of indictment. Causal lens holds—each beat (discovery of arson → codicil → delivery) tightens options until the final image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Wisteria jetty constrains the scene’s choreography and perfumes every beat; the locket-as-micro-setting presses against ribs, charging the final exchange. Sensory selection mirrors urgency—petals catch last light as darkness settles over the moral reckoning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to deliver a “pure” restoration or encode the erased names—tightens once when Mara begins the microscopic codicil. Agency is decision with felt cost; no coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: archival duty collides with human mercy. Final image of two women in wisteria perfume offers non-literal answer—some covenants regenerate through remembering everything. No moralizing, only charged poise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—archival precision filtered through olfactory memory (“steep through her lungs like rare teas”). Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Dialogue minimal but subtext-laden (“Thank you” carries entire moral ledger).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Zero loops; high density (“walnut-ink stains…near-black” does triple sensory, character, plot work). Figurative language disciplined—no mixed metaphors. Final sentence cadence mirrors wisteria’s last perfume release, crystallizing closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: archival restoration as moral reckoning. Risky choice to encode hidden indictment within a mercy act feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of 40-year-old courthouse arson as catalyst prevents trope drift.</comment>
