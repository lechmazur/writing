<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>single sustained interior portrait is vivid; loneliness vs generative drive is shown without labels; centuries-long endurance strains credibility and person continuity</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>lyric accumulative lens: spiral motifs, seed cycles, and lullabies form a repeated textual pattern; closure is resonant reconfiguration—poet’s epiphany reweights wornness as portal—yet cost is felt less as pain than lyric affirmation</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>gargantuan shell and galaxy postcard act as micro-settings whose calcium shadows and star pinholes physically constrain the final act of illumination; sensory density is lush and internally consistent</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>stake—“can pain become seed, can beauty outgrow wars”—escalates by multiplication of arrivals until the greenhouse of grief becomes global refuge; pressure built through cumulative accretion instead of single sharp turn, costing actual lingering insomnia</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>theme of transformation-through-damage blossoms via concrete material practice (charcoal, cracks, light through decay) and lands on a non-literal but endlessly resonant last image—wormholes of light from waste</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>voice is dense and poetic yet distinct; patterned repetition in cadence taught early and reinforced by shell acoustics; hallucinated global chorus kept coherent through alternating internal/lyric distance</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>prose achieves high density without scaffolds for most of its length, but occasional stacked metaphors in peak paragraphs approach purple and small paraphrase loops (“slowly, shyly…”) emerge</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>premise (calcified shell as centuries-long siege-resolution greenhouse) feels fresh; traditional tropes of art-healing-wars fused into a concrete, idiosyncratic practice; risk-taking with lyric time compression pays off</comment>
