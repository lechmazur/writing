<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—mentor vs. walking-backward reflex—are embodied in micro-moves and charged dialogue; Kess’s grief and dawning agency are likewise concrete. The final choice to annotate together is earned by prior causality and carries visible relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the act of annotating crystallizes a joint stance with felt cost (Elara’s forward step, Kess’s aged eyes). Causal lens holds: each beat (“because shadow responds to leaves”) tightens toward the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Library, prism, tea-cup, and drifting swing all constrain choices and charge the final stillness; sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reversing exile—tightens once when Kess grasps the spiral break; agency drives the escalation. Cost is legible in Elara’s relinquished secrecy and Kess’s raw anger turned resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “resilience as weapon” emerges from embodied choices, not statements. Final image of the stilled swing reweights earlier hush into earned poise; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—archivist’s “rust on iron” laugh, Kess’s sharp edges—without register drift. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot; free-indirect style is clean and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Shard-mirror library, reversible exile, and tea-leaf geometry synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious whole. Risky compression pays off in a resonant final image that feels inevitable.</comment>
