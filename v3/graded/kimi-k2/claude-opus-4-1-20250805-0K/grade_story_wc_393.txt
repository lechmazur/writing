<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eliza’s embodied grief and micro-choices (threading copper, selecting tools) reveal inherited grace vs. Thomas’s rage; the final decision to play the box is earned and carries visible cost. Marcus’s motivation to “bridge chasms” is clear, though his interiority is thinner. The sibling mirroring is specific and character-bound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored box crystallizes a new stance—neither forgiveness nor forgetting but deliberate repair. Causal chain holds: Thomas’s notes → Eliza’s labor → shared listening. Cost is felt in Eliza’s admission “he deserved worse” and the twenty-year wait. Lens is Causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shop’s brass, dust motes, and fractured light constrain mood and echo the broken heart; the music boxes serve as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial anchors arrive early; weather shifts mirror internal states without cliché. Light through storm clouds is integrated, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the apology can become something “she can hold”—tightens when Eliza chooses to follow Thomas’s instructions. One meaningful escalation: the first hesitant notes growing stronger. Cost is the emotional exposure of hearing her mother’s melody resurrected by her brother’s design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: repair as an active, ongoing form of reckoning. Subtext lives in silence, tool selection, and the final “vibrant hush.” The ending reframes the broken past without moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “maybe we deserve better.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Eliza’s sensory filter; light “breaking across her face” is character-specific perception. Dialogue is spare and subtextual (“I might need—another perspective”). Rhythm modulates with tension; no head-hopping. Voice is consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective (“mechanism remembered its purpose”) and never muddies causality. Strong verbs and tactile nouns dominate. Final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familiar premise—restoring a broken heirloom to process grief—is refreshed through clockwork specificity and the chaplain’s mediated absolution. The synthesis feels inevitable: prison workshop knowledge channeled into posthumous atonement. No gimmicks; risk lies in quietness.</comment>
