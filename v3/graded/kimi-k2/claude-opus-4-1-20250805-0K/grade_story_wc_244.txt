<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sadie’s contradictory impulses—mocking jocularity masking genuine loneliness—surface in every micro-choice (offering the phone, pocketing the vial). Marcus’s arc from passive collector to active connector is earned through the single beat of accepting the phone. Both remain flawed, specific, and their interaction crystallizes a status shift under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the moon-rock trade reweights the “economy of human need” and Marcus’s new purpose carries visible social cost (monthly calls). Causal chain (rumor → meeting → catalysis) holds without contradiction; the ivy station frames the before/after of connection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ivy-choked station is more than backdrop; its “green cathedral” constrains movement and mirrors the theme of abandoned connection. Sensory detail is selective—metallic otherness of moon rock, thermos as peace offering—anchoring POV priorities. Micro-setting (platform pillars) shapes the staging of the exchange.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—loneliness vs purposeful connection—is signaled in Sadie’s first line and tightens when the phone is offered. One decisive turn: Marcus accepts the catalytic role, foreclosing his isolation. Cost is legible in the monthly commitment and the irrevocable loss of the moon rock heirloom.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete transaction: reciprocity as the only sustainable economy. Final image of the station “holding its breath” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (thermos, phone) and silence after Sadie’s disappearance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—Sadie’s jocular desperation, Marcus’s hesitant earnestness—each line carrying subtext and goal. Syntax modulates with pressure: clipped exchanges under ivy shadows, lyrical final cadence. No head-hopping; POV stays tight to Sadie then widens to Marcus at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every line advances character or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language (“grin sharp enough to cut glass”) is sparse, purposeful, and never muddies clarity. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—banter quickens, final paragraph slows to crystallize.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—loneliness cured by catalyzed reciprocity via moon-rock rumor chain—is fresh and specific. Tropes (mysterious fixer, magical object) are transformed through grounded logistics jargon and the concrete phone contract. Risky structural choice (fade-out disappearance) pays off by reinforcing Sadie’s mythic role.</comment>
