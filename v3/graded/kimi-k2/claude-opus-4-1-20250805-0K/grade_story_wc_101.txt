<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marta’s interiority is concrete and embodied (“weathered hands paused on the bell rope”), her motives (dignity over charity) drive every micro-choice, and the final renunciation of credit is earned. Samuel’s presence supplies relational pressure that alters tactics. Minor slip: “gently persistent wisdom” is label-speak, not dramatized contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each midnight bell layers density until the pattern breaks into self-sustaining community. Closure is a Charged Poise—Marta’s final toll reconfigures meaning without claiming victory, cost legible in her fatigue and the unified silence that protects her anonymity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor and bell are micro-settings that constrain every distribution route; their weathered texture mirrors the community’s endurance and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (midnight quiet, ridge wind) and filtered through Marta’s ritual focus. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—community survival with dignity—tightens via nightly anonymous exchanges that foreclose the need for external saviors. One decisive intensification: the first returned basket shifts Marta from sole provider to catalyst. Cost is visible in her depleted stores and eventual exhaustion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of invisible mutual aid emerges from concrete acts, never sermonized. Final image of unnamed footsteps gathering beneath the arbor offers a resonant, non-moral answer: identity dissolves into collective heartbeat. Subtext in Samuel’s whisper and the crowd’s silence deepens the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Marta’s perceptual filter; diction is spare, rhythmic, and age-weathered. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext (“need has no face”). No head-hopping or register drift; the amplified quiet is sustained through cadence and white space.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, and image-dense without overwriting. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or motive. Occasional elevated phrasing (“benevolent shadows”) is earned by context. Final paragraph’s breath-length variation mirrors the bell’s fading echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise—clandestine mutual aid—feels fresh through the antique bell’s ritual and the refusal of heroic credit. Specificity of terra-cotta arbor, midnight runs, and generational weaving transforms trope into lived system. Risk in quiet ending pays off via resonant collective silence.</comment>
