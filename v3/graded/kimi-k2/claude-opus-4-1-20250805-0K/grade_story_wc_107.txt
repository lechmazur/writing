<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Marina’s grief-driven vocation and her father’s memory are clear, but interiority occasionally slips into narrated epiphanies ("glass remembers heat") that skate over active contradiction. The final choice is tender yet risks tidy moral calibration: containment becomes a safe metaphor rather than a costly stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story lands Earned Stasis: her choice to stay and invite newcomers crystallizes the shift from evacuation to patient, glass-held return. Causality—abandoned plant → glass sanctuary—holds cleanly, with the thaw both literal and emotional constraint. Cost is felt in her exile from previous prestige; closure carries the weight of continuous tending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Control-room detail (broken tiles, radiation signs, cold glass) is selective and physically constrains action—glass fragments must be swept, meltwater pools where it shouldn’t, torch heat becomes scarce refuge. The thawing ice threads through as ticking clock: dripping shifts to surrender, mirroring internal thaw without authorial nudge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</question><comment>Dominant stake is safe containment of human questions within literal poison. Pressure stays low but coherent; arrival of couple tightens the loop from solitary craft to communal risk. Cost is implied (lifelong stewardship), yet escalation flattens because their fears remain off-page abstractions rather than tested threats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme—how to breathe safety into a ruined place—emerges through image (warm sphere resting on cold console) and through act, avoiding sermon. Bookmark and reactor shutdown button reprice memory without overt allegory; final invitation avoids tidy moral, letting ambiguity linger like radiation counts below speech.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is contemplative-mythic, consistent with Marina’s self-narrated ritual. Lyric compression—“water pooling where warning signs once stood”—teaches reader to parse elegy as working space. No POV drift; each observation keeps her sensibility at the fore.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose rings rhythmically—“blue at its heart, like hope itself”—but avoids purple overload; metaphors lean glass, ice, and radiation without mixed collisions. Only faint loop: repeated “glass remembers heat” twice risks mantra; otherwise sentences carry variable stresses that echo slow craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion—glassblowing studio inside Chernobyl control room, thaw as both hazard and mercy—never feels gimmick; each element springs from Marina’s lived paradox. Final image of torch-light in derelict darkness carries fresh, earned resonance; no known equivalent scene.</comment>
