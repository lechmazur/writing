<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elena’s reticence and etymological obsession are embodied in micro-choices—holding the crystal, pocketing it, choosing silence—showing interior contradiction between institutional obedience and linguistic faith. The final refusal to testify in expected form crystallizes her arc with visible social cost. Yet her emotional range stays slightly narrow; more embodied contradiction mid-scene would lift the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the “silence between words” reweights the Committee’s authority and Elena’s stance, with the felt cost of professional exile implied by their stern faces. Causal chain—crystal discovery → pattern recognition → refusal to conform—holds cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; no temporal or spatial drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn is filtered through Elena’s scholar gaze; dust motes, breathing shelves, and refracted light constrain her choices—she hides the crystal in its gloom and later uses the dawn beam to reveal truth. Micro-setting (crystal-as-lens) functions as environment that charges the final image. A sharper sensory anchor (temperature, smell) would edge it higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—language’s living future versus institutional stasis—tightens once when Elena decides to testify by silence; the cost is the Committee’s disapproval and her career risk. Pressure escalates via pattern accumulation (new words glimpsed) rather than external reversals, fitting Accumulative lens. One more beat of direct institutional threat would nudge it up.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: language as uncontainable life versus codified death. The crystal’s refracted “grief-tender” and “time-drunk” reweight this theme without moralizing. Final image of silence sprouting words offers resonant non-literal answer. No thematic drift or late exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature—precise etymological diction, hushed cadence, light-splitting imagery—remains consistent and character-bound. No POV leakage; Committee voices stay external. Compression and lyric elision are taught early and paid off at closure. One stray elevated phrase (“institutional authority”) slightly jars Elena’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; each sentence layers image and idea (“books breathing like sleeping animals”). No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with tension. Occasional soft filter (“she realized”) is minor and does not dull closure.</comment>

<grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-dictionary linguistic stasis observed via sonically reflective crystal—feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes of rebel scholar and forbidden knowledge are transformed through etymological obsession and sensory metaphor. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
