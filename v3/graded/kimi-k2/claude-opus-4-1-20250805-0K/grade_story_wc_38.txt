<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s embodied decryption and the inherited dance-memory are vivid and specific; her micro-choices (each splash, the dice landing on its corner) reveal motive and stakes. The final recognition—“Welcome home, granddaughter”—earns its emotional cost through prior causal setup. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic label-speak. A hairline slip: the phrase “destiny settled on her shoulders like an old coat” edges toward cliché.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s backward dance unlocks the lab and reconfigures her identity. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each movement layer tightens stakes until the spiral water and glowing dice crystallize meaning. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are set by line 3. Persistent constraint (flood, dice refusal to show numbers) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The flooded lab’s green-filtered light, knee-deep water, and broken skylights are selective and purposeful; water eddies mirror on-screen spirals, constraining Maya’s footwork. The dice as micro-setting object charges the final image when it glows and reveals engravings. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible positions. One minor over-description: “shafts of green-filtered sunlight that danced across Maya’s shoulders” could lose “danced” without loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlocking the sealed knowledge—tightens via each dance phrase; the dice’s impossible balance signals rising cost. Agency is continuous: every splash and turn narrows options until the backward sequence forces the final reconfiguration. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the spiral water and dice glow are earned consequences. Cost is visible: Maya’s bodily exertion and the irreversible revelation of her lineage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—inheritance as encryption, vulnerability transmuted into strength—emerges through concrete action rather than statement. The final image of the spiral water holding shape crystallizes the thematic reweighting without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: the dice’s refusal to show numbers implies resistance to deterministic reading. One near-cliché “smelling of memories she’d never lived” slightly blunts specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Maya’s perceptual signature; sensory hierarchy (light on shoulders, water resistance) reflects her dancer’s priorities. Syntax modulates with pressure—long lyrical sentences build, then compress during the reversal. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“mathematical poetry”) is justified by her intellectual lineage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors. Minor loop: “each splash deliberate, each turn measured” borders on template cadence but serves rhythmic mimicry. No artifacts in closure beat; final paragraph is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of dance-as-decryption and consciousness-encoding is fresh and fully committed; no obvious antecedents. The inherited-dance premise transforms the familiar “descendant unlocks secret lab” trope into something specific and inevitable. Risky lyric structure pays off: the backward dance as undoing/affirmation feels both surprising and prefigured. Specificity of the dice’s corner-balance grounds the speculative element.</comment>
