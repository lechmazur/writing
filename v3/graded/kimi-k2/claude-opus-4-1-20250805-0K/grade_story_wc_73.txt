<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s grim-optimist stance is embodied in every micro-choice—rolling the dice, counting steps, carving proofs—so motivation stays legible. Interiority is concrete (“texture of the missed opportunity was rough against his fingers”) and contradictory impulses (hope vs. proof) coexist in scene. The final renunciation—climbing on because mathematics guarantees rupture—earns its cost through prior causality. Only the off-page Sarah remains a faint silhouette, limiting relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dice will show snake-eyes, the staircase will remember, and Marcus will still climb—cost crystallized in “patient urgency.” Causal lens holds: every roll and step tightens toward inevitable rupture. Orientation is taught early; the infinite staircase is anchored by tactile detail and mathematical rule. No causality breaks; the loop-length proof is foreshadowed and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The staircase itself is a living constraint—each step’s momentum dictates the next—so setting actively shapes tactics. Micro-setting (the chipped die, stone step, carved equations) functions as charged object and spatial anchor. Sensory selection is urgent: “probability itself had fractured” narrows perception to the die’s corner. Final image reweights the setting as both prison and promised escape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape via mathematical rupture—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates through each roll and carved proof. One meaningful tightening: realization that the loop equals Sarah’s lifetime heartbeats raises the cost of every step. Agency remains with Marcus; coincidence never resolves. The price is felt in the eternal climb and the irreversible loss of Sarah.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: entropy as freedom, imperfection as feature. The chipped die reweights from flaw to seed of rupture without authorial commentary. Final image offers non-literal answer—mathematics will remember choice—without moralizing. Subtext lives in silence about Sarah’s death and in the dice’s accumulating wear.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is mathematically precise yet haunted: “probability itself had fractured,” “ruthless logic of perpetual motion.” Syntax mirrors the staircase’s recursive rhythm. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly Marcus-bound. Compression (“three months now, or perhaps three minutes”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Density is high: “the system conserving even chance itself” compresses physics and theme. Rhythm accelerates with climb, breathes with roll. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful; no mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The infinite staircase as closed-loop lifetime is a fresh synthesis of mathematical theology and human regret. Tropes (eternal climb, deterministic prison) are transformed through the chipped die and heartbeat metric. Risk-taking—no antagonist, no dialogue—heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
