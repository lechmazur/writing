<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to flee yet tethered by duty—are embodied in her compulsive handling of the walnut and her practiced lie. The final renunciation (handing over the seed) is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she remains bound. Interiority is specific and embodied (“graceless beauty of someone who’d learned efficiency over elegance”). Minor slip: the father/child are sketched more as functions than crucibles.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara’s refusal to abandon the orchard is crystallized in the last paragraph with felt cost (“tonight, she’d saved two more lives, and that was enough”). Causal lens holds: each beat (guiding travelers, surrendering the seed) tightens her trap. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props. Blueprint’s secret remains unresolved, but that deferred knowledge is part of the stasis, not a flaw.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth, frost clock, and mechanical birds constrain every move; the inverted orchard itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (“copper wings catching the last amber light”). Spatial choreography is coherent; the western gate and eastern entrance track cleanly. Weather directly alters tactics (“three hours until frost”).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mara’s freedom versus the valley’s survival—is signaled early and tightened when she gives away the walnut. Agency drives escalation: each guided traveler costs her another piece of herself. The final beat narrows options to a single path—endurance. Cost is legible on the page (“she would remain here”). No coincidence resolves the tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of reluctant guardianship emerges through action, not statement; the inverted orchard literalizes the cost of caretaking. Subtext operates in the walnut’s silent reprise and the mechanical birds’ “approval.” Final image reweights the premise: salvation for others equals perpetual exile for the savior. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Voice is distinct and textured: precise yet weary (“offhandedly exact precision”), tactile diction (“boots scraping against worn stone”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices temperature, gear, mechanical sounds. No POV leakage. Compression in final paragraph heightens poise without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful (“branches burrowing deep while roots reached skyward”). Rhythm modulates with urgency. Minor filter verbs appear but do not stall momentum. Final line lands with crystallized cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>The inverted orchard, mechanical birds, and blueprint seed form a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Tropes of cursed caretaker and labyrinth are transformed through grounded specificity. The walnut’s reprise feels inevitable yet surprising. Risk-taking (lyric compression, deferred blueprint secret) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
