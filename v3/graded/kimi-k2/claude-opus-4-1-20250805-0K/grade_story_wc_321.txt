<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is specific (Hourglass ‘hummed’, sideways clocks) and his resilience modulates into choice at the end, but the final moment—using the hourglass as catalyst—doesn’t feel like a hard choice Marcus makes; it shifts to universal convergence, diluting personal agency to a witness-role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early, but Closure is a soft Conceptual Repricing of parallel timelines rather than a decisive change anchored in Marcus’s earlier beats; the ending lacks visible local cost that reconfigures his immediate stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The spectral grotto is evoked through shifting limestone cliffs and starlight that reweight scene stakes by fluxing between solid and ethereal, constraining docking tactics—tight, lyrical, and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Escalation is driven by the ferry’s coherence dissolution and final merger; Marcus chooses convergence protocol at the climax, narrowing possibilities and accumulating poetic cost in a single intensifying image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of merging timelines emerges concretely through the hourglass signal and grotto’s starlight, culminating in a resonant final image—passengers walking into unified possibility—that reweights earlier strands without moral summation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Dense lyrical syntax supports an idiosyncratic multiversal register; occasional template cadence in early descriptions mildly dulled flow, yet rhythmic control under pressure (e.g. the ‘folded-into-never-and-always’ line) is strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmic but suffers from micro-redundancy (‘vanishing’ multiples early) and a couple stock-phrase elisions; dramatic need slightly outweighs the artifact penalty in closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The scenario synthesizes quantum-ferry and hourglass into a fresh, non-obvious lens; the minute-long ferry ride reconfigures infinite worlds with earned, specific stakes and a charged final image.</comment>
