<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s guilt and tentative re-engagement are embodied in tactile micro-choices (pocketing the compass, counting poles). Interiority is specific, but the final pivot to “teaching kayak navigation” feels slightly under-motivated—more stated than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the pattern of pole-counting and compass handling tightens toward a Charged Poise at pole nineteen and the final offer to teach. Closure lands with felt cost (accepting a humbler form of guidance), though the causal jump to the teaching decision is compressed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Coastal launch, weathered brass, and numbered utility poles are vivid and selective. The poles evolve from backdrop to active navigation system, constraining Marcus’s route and charging the final image; the compass’s tarnish mirrors interior state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Marcus can re-enter the world without repeating catastrophe—escalates through each pole. The tightening at pole nineteen (site of past failure) forces a micro-choice: keep the broken compass as witness rather than tool. Cost is visible but modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of salvageable brokenness emerges organically from compass, poles, and Marcus’s halting laugh. Final image of “learning to swim in shallower water” offers resonant, non-moralizing reweighting. Avoids explicit thesis until the last exchange, and even that is tempered by Sarah’s soft echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Marcus’s sensory filter; diction is weathered, salt-stained, consistent. Dialogue between Marcus and Sarah carries subtext of mutual recognition without collapsing into therapeutic speech. Rhythm modulates with paddle strokes and memory intrusions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; occasional mild scaffold (“perhaps… perhaps…”) but no loops or mixed metaphors. Sensory specificity (“whiskered face” of the seal) enlivens without overwriting. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar redemption arc by replacing celestial navigation with humble utility-pole waypoints. The broken compass as talisman rather than tool offers fresh inflection; risk is modest but coherent. Avoids clichéd sea-as-metaphor through grounded detail.</comment>
