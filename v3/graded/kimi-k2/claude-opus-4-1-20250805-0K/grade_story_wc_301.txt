<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s guilt-driven compulsion is embodied in tactile micro-choices (pressing ivy, drawing on the wall) and culminates in a credible renunciation of map-making for witness; the interior contradiction between methodical science and frozen paralysis is dramatized, not told. One slip: “frozen on the bank” is summarized rather than re-lived in scene, blunting the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Marcus forecloses the absolution-through-data path and accepts forward motion without maps. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each graffiti line and ivy tendril layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the phrase “raw solace,” a felt forfeiture of certainty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The station’s decay and the ivy’s patient reclamation physically constrain Marcus’s movements and mirror his internal state; the bellows and graffitied wall function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; only the off-page train whistle feels slightly convenient rather than earned.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens through the escalating pattern of failed documentation; the decisive shift occurs when Marcus chooses witness over measurement, forfeiting the safety of data. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no external reversals, only deepening recognition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between stasis and flow; the river/ivy metaphors accumulate meaning without overt statement. Final image of “green overtaking gray” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to live with unfixable guilt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—scientific precision laced with penitent lyricism (“dust wheezed out like a confession”). POV remains stable; perceptual signature filters every detail through Marcus’s guilt-sharpened lens. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One minor loop: “ivy tapped…like patient fingers” echoes earlier “ivy…like a man trying to disappear,” but the reprise reweights meaning, so the artifact is minimal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The transformation of obsessive river documentation into a quiet act of witness feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of the patched bellows and graffitied bathroom rescues familiar grief-recovery terrain from cliché. Risk in the quiet, non-confrontational ending pays off through charged image.</comment>
