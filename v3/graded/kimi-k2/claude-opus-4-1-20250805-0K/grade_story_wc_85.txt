<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias’s internal contradiction—manufacturing false histories while living one—is clearly rooted and embodied in scene, but the grandfather motive feels imported (brief reflection) rather than lived. The decisive shutdown of his business is motivated, yet the personal guilt’s source is never dramatized; it arrives as summary, dulling emotional purchase.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as earned Resonant Reconfiguration: the watch hand placed among driftwood ends a family legacy under chosen Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds—each piece re-weights the moral choice—yet late exposition about the grandfather betrays pressure into summary instead of scene, costing top-band clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and salt-etched driftwood provide tactile specificity and a spatial anchor that constraints visibility and secrecy. Weather details serve mood, but their direct constraint on final action remains modest; they set rather than shape the decisive move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silence vs confession about manufactured memories—escalates steadily as each driftwood fragment increases factual density and internal cost. A single deepening suffices: renunciation of the business carries visible, irrevocable consequence under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars without sermon: carved initials and false genealogies converge in the question of who owns memory. The final image refracts rather than resolves, leaving the reader with weighted ambiguity rather than a neat moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Voice is textured: genealogist’s professional detachment fractures into sensuous coastal observations. Filter-verbs and long syntactic crests occasionally dilute immediacy, but register stays consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and ear-tested; sentences carry dual freight. Minor scaffold: “dusk painted the sky in bruised purples” followed by “salt-worn wood” creates soft repetition without renewed pressure; occasional elevated diction edges outside POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh fusion of genealogical forgery with coastal driftwood evidence; refugee betrayal reframed through micro-relics feels new despite familiar family-guilt territory. Specificity of carvings over generic beach detritus makes inheritance unavoidable.</comment>
