<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is textured—Methodist skepticism collides with reverence for place-memory—and his micro-choice to photograph rather than pocket the valve wheel crystallizes a believable shift. The swallowed-truth motive is dramatized through radio fragments and embodied alertness, not labels. Cost is felt in the closing image of metal dust settling into bone. Minor: the “drowsy alertness” refrain edges toward label-speak once too often.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus’s refusal to remove the valve wheel reweights the premise—confession without absolution—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: each radio fragment layers density until the psychic’s “meant to be witnessed” line reframes prior beats. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in the final exhale of the tunnel.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tunnel’s sweating brick, oxidized valve, and radio static are selective, sensory, and filtered through Marcus’s urb-ex priorities. Environment constrains the final choice—leaving the wheel in situ—charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. One minor drift: “recycled air” is generic amid otherwise sharp detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bearing witness to swallowed truth—is signaled early and tightens through accumulating radio confessions. The meaningful turn is Marcus’s renunciation; the cost is the permanent weight he now carries. Pressure escalates via Accumulative density, not causal reversals. Coincidence (radio clarity at the right moment) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of collective guilt and unabsolved memory emerges from concrete particulars—beaded valve, radio voices, tunnel dust—without sermonizing. The final image of “some shifts never really end” offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in the psychic’s silence and Marcus’s refusal deepens complexity. No late thematic echo or moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s perceptual signature—selective attention to machinery, radio static, bodily fatigue. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer sentences in calmer beats, clipped fragments as he nears the valve. No POV leakage or register drift. Dialogue fragments feel authentic to late-night call-ins.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; each sentence advances atmosphere or character. Figurative language is spare and purposeful—“metal tombstones,” “DNA strands of prayer beads.” No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. One minor filter-verb cluster (“he knew,” “he understood”) in the penultimate paragraph dulls immediacy slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The ghost-shift conceit is refreshed through radio confessions and the beaded valve, avoiding trope clichés. Specificity—1982 closure, Methodist skepticism, union newspapers—grounds the premise. The synthesis of industrial decay and unabsolved guilt feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky quiet ending lands with conceptual cost.</comment>
