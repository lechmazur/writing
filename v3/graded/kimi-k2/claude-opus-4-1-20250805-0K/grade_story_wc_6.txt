<comment>Maya is fully inhabited; gestures embody past scars and present resolve, but the interior conflict between inherited fire and chosen compassion is occasionally summarized (“She understood fire's hunger...”) instead of performed in beat. The grafting act provides visible cost and renunciation, yet the final stance arrives more narrated than earned in micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer reweights the stake until the final charged poise beneath the coin at her sternum. Closure is clean—“ready”—with legible before/after shift and felt cost. Orientation and causality obey the lyric drift without lapse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Lagoon, dunes, volcanic sand, kelp: each element is tactile, biased through firefighter perception, and carries mirror/emotional charge. Coin, thread, and sand together form a micro-setting that constrains the graft choice and charges the final talisman image.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transforming paternal legacy—is established early and presses every micro-beat. Escalation occurs as the graft ritual narrows options, forcing an explicit renunciation with visible price: sand sealed in coin over heart. Tension is maintained through sensory deepening rather than external reversals.</comment>

<comment>Theme of inheritance-as-rupture and renewal emerges through ritual action, not statement. Final “proof that even the deepest burns can become doorways” is implied by image of coin resting on sternum and footprints erased—resonant without moralizing. Subtext operates in the kelp’s forgiveness and the lagoon’s accepting stillness.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice blends lyrical compression with muscular verisimilitude of firefighter craft (“moves with gracefully alert precision”). POV remains single and coherent; sensory perception consistently biases toward heat-dark-obsidian palette, supporting accumulative texture. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off in closure.</comment>

<comment>Prose is near-flawless: every sentence multiplexes sensory, thematic, and causal functions. Rhythm modulates from contemplative to decisive. No loops, no mixed metaphors, precise diction. One minor drift—“firefighter’s hands—scarred from both profession and inheritance”—leans summary but does not slow momentum.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar “child redeems parent’s sin” arc is wholly re-rooted in volcanic lagoon ritual. Synthesis of firefighter craft, volcanic sand talisman, and kelp imagery feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is emotional rather than structural; specific inflections make the retelling fresh.</comment>
