<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marina’s endurance-turned-prayer is credibly embodied; the bronze foot anchors her micro-choices under crisis and delivers a renunciation that costs her the return she still desires. Contradictory motives (duty vs yearning) act simultaneously, never summarized out loud. Only the child-call tips toward sentiment—minor but survivable slip.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A clear Accumulative lens: each midnight call layers pressure; the waning moon shrinks her strength until the final refusal (Earned Stasis). The last paragraph reconfigures meaning—she becomes permanent signal, never migrant—cost felt in the bronze’s warmth: “holding her to this place.” No causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The signal station, broken hydraulics, and poisoned corridor feel tactile and lived-in. The bronze foot becomes micro-setting, literally levering the crank and absorbing new scars—environment that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography clean throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: shepherd others through lethal territory before she herself succumbs to the same pull. Each call escalates stakes: Diego’s position in sulfur fields raises the visible price. One tightening beat: final refusal to leave anchoring station—cost crystallized. Coincidence withheld from resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of caretaker vs inheritor emerges from concrete acts; no sermonizing. The geography of loss becomes legible in instructions like “carry salt in your left pocket.” Final image offers nonliteral answer: bronze foot warms as if answering back—resonant reweight without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice remains controlled under pressure: clipped sentences during calls, longer lyrical arcs in reflection. Distinct perceptual signature: Marina notices moon phases with body-shudder immediacy. Compression of midnight calls avoids monotony; rhythm modulates with tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances character, tool, or atmosphere. Metaphors disciplined: “her strength fluctuated with moon phases” is specific and causal. Micro loop detected—“they’d left her with strangers while they scouted ahead” echoes twice—minor blemish, does not touch closure.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Reverse migration as genetic haunting gives the familiar disaster arc a biological angle. Bronze foot reused as heirloom, lever, relic, and anchor without cliché. Risky compression of multiple voices into cryptic calls is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
