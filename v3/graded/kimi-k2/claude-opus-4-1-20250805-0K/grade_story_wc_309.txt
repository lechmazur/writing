<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—failure at the Academy yet refusal to surrender wonder—remains embodied and specific; the keystone’s warmth and the act of unstrapping the medallion crystallize her values under pressure. The final renunciation (returning to the world below) carries visible cost: she forfeits institutional validation for an unquantifiable magic. However, the grandmother’s whispered advice is slightly abstract, softening the causal hinge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s mist-walk rewrites her stance toward magic and machines, with the lingering luminance trail serving as felt cost. Causal linkage holds—failure → rejection → mist → revelation—without teleporting props. Orientation is anchored early; the spire and cloud-sea remain spatially coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The icebound spire and cloud-sea are not postcard backdrops; altitude restricts motion (stepping into void) and the keystone’s roughness literally charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—frost, bite of wind, warmth of stone—filtered through Mira’s bias. Micro-setting (the keystone as handled object) constrains her choice to trust mist over machine.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether imperfect human magic can matter beside perfect automation—is signaled early and tightened when Mira steps onto mist. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the conflict. Cost is legible in the forfeiture of Academy status, though the external stakes (machines’ dominance) remain more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the sacred resides in imperfection, not algorithmic certainty. Subtext is carried by image—rough keystone vs. flawless constructs—rather than statement. The final image of “brilliant dimness” reweights the premise without moralizing, offering conceptual repricing of value itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature (“brilliant dimness,” “lingering luminance”) belongs to Mira’s heightened sensitivity. Syntax modulates with altitude—longer cadences in reflection, clipped fragments during the step into void. No head-hopping; POV remains intimate and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; metaphors are precise (“needle through silk,” “cape woven from dawn”) and never muddle causality. Rhythm breathes with emotional beats—mist catching her “as if it had been waiting” slows the moment before the luminous trail accelerates. No loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of automated perfection vs. flawed human wonder feels fresh; the mist-walk as primitive magic subverts typical power-escalation tropes. Specificity of the keystone and “brilliant dimness” anchors universality. Risk-taking in quiet, lyric closure pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
