<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vera’s solitude and curiosity are embodied through tactile ritual (tracing Tycho, mixing regolith chemistry) and the hourglass grain anchors her lineage of watchers. Her final act—leaving the hourglass—crystallizes a renunciation whose cost is the abandonment of her life’s purpose. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic self-talk. One slip: “purposefully curious” is stated rather than dramatized early.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: because the ice will exhale once more, therefore Vera descends, documents, and relinquishes her post. Closure is a Charged Poise—camera secured, hourglass left—whose cost is permanent exile from the Moon. Orientation is immediate; lens (Causal) holds without contradiction. No teleporting props or retro patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lunar vacuum, Tycho’s rim, and the green-glow chemical timer are not backdrop but tactical constraints: the airless silence forces Vera’s chemistry, the crater walls dictate descent lines, earthlight wavelength calibrates the photosensitive burn. The hourglass becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: bear final witness to vanishing ice. Escalation is one tightening—vapor emerges, camera must capture before evacuation rocket arrives. Agency is Vera’s deliberate descent and exposure choice; cost is irreversible departure. No coincidence resolves; luck only complicates timing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of retreat versus witness emerges from the ice’s last breath and humanity’s retreat; no direct statement. Subtext lives in the hourglass grain’s return and the green chemical burn that counts down to absence. Final image reweights the premise: we leave, the Moon keeps its silence. Resonance is earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays inside Vera’s perceptual bias—she notices seismic fissures, silver-nitrate spectra, the pregnant Earth. Syntax lengthens in reflection, compresses under descent pressure. No head-hopping. Register is scientific-poetic without drifting into lecture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “sublimating ice released periodic wisps of vapor” compresses physics and mood. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with action—short clauses for descent, longer cadences for reflection. Final paragraph earns its lyric lift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: Apollo-era Hasselblad repurposed with lunar regolith chemistry to photograph the Moon’s last secret tear. The hourglass grain—Earth flung by Tycho impact—reverses the colonial gaze. Risky quiet ending lands as inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
