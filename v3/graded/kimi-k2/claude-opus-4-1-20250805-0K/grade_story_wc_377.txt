<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mariel’s silence and vocation ground every moment; yet interiority remains abstract ('wonder itself', 'capacity for enchantment') rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. We feel her resolve but not her fear or regret. Enough presence to pass, short of visceral cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: iceberg melts, bronze absorbs, world re-ignites—Decisive Change with felt cost (final ice drop). Causal lens holds: “when the ice fully melted...” triggers “the bells began...” Linkage is present and unbroken. Exceeds threshold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Bell-tower and cloud-sea provide immediate spatial anchor; micro-setting (bronze bell surface, wind-driven gimbals) constrains the exact method of absorption. No single object re-configures at closure, so just under 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Stakes—loss of wonder—arrive early and intensify with each melt-droplet. Single tightening: bell modification is the last possible path; cost is the final ice-fragment vanishing. Agency is strong, though external wind finally disperses the new symphony.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from action rather than statement: "wonder itself" transforms from fragile object into renewable frequency. Final image reweights earlier silence and bell symphonies—Conceptual Repricing accomplished without moralising.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question>
<comment>Prose has tactile rhythm (“bronze bodies, when tuned... absorb the color”) and controlled lyric pulse; no POV leakage. Distinct perceptual signature sustained through muted vigour; cadence tightens during absorption sequence, paying off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Sentences do double duty—image propels plot, never stalls. Minor overwrite: “color that pulsed like a heartbeat” and “glististen” near-synonym loop, but these never obscure cause/effect. Compression admirable for length.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Premise—bell tower as instrument that broadcasts pure, non-verbal truth—is fresh and fully pursued. Transformation of seasonal muteness into gift rather than curse is non-obvious synthesis. Risk taken and paid off.</comment>
