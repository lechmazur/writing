<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marlow’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her synesthetic perception is shown through concrete sensory choices (“Elena’s name rippled outward in concentric rings of deep violet”). The luminous vows and hotel key function as charged objects that reweight her stance. The final acceptance of her sister’s legacy is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost: she forecloses ordinary life to become a beacon for others. Minor slip: the phrase “pretending our perception was madness” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marlow’s public vow reconfigures her future and Elena’s dispersed consciousness is acknowledged. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each glowing lantern, journal page, and phosphorescent mast layers density until the final image crystallizes. Cost is legible: she commits to lifelong wandering and teaching. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drowned library and lantern-lit harbor are rendered with tactile specificity (“barnacle-crusted hatch,” “ankle-deep brine”). The setting constrains movement and supplies the journal that changes tactics. The sky lantern release functions as a live clock tightening decisions. Final image of lanterns drifting toward stars recharges the opening hatch descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—accepting the synesthetic gift and continuing Elena’s work—is signaled early and tightened by the ascending lanterns. One meaningful deepening: reading the journal shifts Marlow from hiding to public vow. Cost is visible: she forfeits anonymity. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (glowing masts) only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of hiding transcendent perception versus communal responsibility. Subtext operates in the phosphorescence and the key’s silent promise. Final image offers non-literal resonance—lanterns as dispersed consciousness—without moralizing. No thematic drift; complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is synesthetic, lyrical, and consistent: “meteor hush,” “copper and jade” lanterns. Perceptual signature is character-bound and never head-hops. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm accelerates during the vow. Occasional elevated diction (“alchemical treatment”) fits the lamplighter’s archaic milieu. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: synesthesia as secret society initiation, drowned libraries as meeting grounds, lanterns as preserved consciousness. Premise is non-obvious and fully committed. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure. Specificity anchors universals; no derivative echoes.</comment>
