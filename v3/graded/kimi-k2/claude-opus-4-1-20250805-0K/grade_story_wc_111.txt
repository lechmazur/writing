<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta’s dovetailing decisions to mend fate with cracked marbles, lie to plants, and refuse to yield to the Luck Index create a coherent arc of earned stasis. Internal conflict is embodied through her ritualistic polishing rather than exposition. Flaws (determination shading into delusion) compound visibly and cost her social standing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal drive: every garden rebellion stems from a deliberate “mended deception”; the closure—Marta passing on a fresh crack to the young woman—narrows future options with visible cost. Lens clarity present throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Garden maze’s copper loops and living vines constrain movement; crack formations on marbles mirror plant growth, charging the ending. Micro-setting—apron pocket, training wires—functions as setting objects that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove gardens can defy luck. Escalation tightens as Ministry index drops but roses bloom, forcing Marta to double-down; visible price is renouncing institutional legitimacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from Marta’s paradox: lies become true when believed completely. Final image—new cracked marble passed on—reweights “luck as measurable” without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct aged-voice with tactile diction (“gnarled fingers trailing,” “clouded marble”); perception degrades under Ministry gaze. Dialogue lines pursue goals—Marta persuades the young gardener, subtext packed into gift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm propels; each sentence layers tactile information (“whispered secrets,” “lightning-crack”). No loops; metaphors stay within character lexicon (plants, copper).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cracked marbles as talismanic currency for lies-become-truth. Garden astrology re-framed through lived horticultural detail. Final gesture feels inevitable.</comment>
