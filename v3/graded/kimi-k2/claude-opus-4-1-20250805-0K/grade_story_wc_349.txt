<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Merrick’s interiority is vivid—his habit of “quantifying absence” is a concrete, character-specific lens—but the child’s motivation is delivered in a single declarative burst rather than embodied contradiction; the final renunciation (“some shops open not to sell…”) is earned yet stated more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each droplet, bottle, and glass apple layers density until the final image reweights the premise; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where endings dissolve into perpetual beginning, cost legible in the transformed inventory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass orchard, cloud sea, and crystalline fruit are not mere backdrop; the setting’s story-nature trembles when endings are excised, directly constraining Merrick’s choice and charging the final image with “impossible to tell” sunrise/sunset.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—what it costs to un-know endings—tightens once when the child’s request forces Merrick to incise; pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the ethics of narrative closure versus endless possibility. The final image of perpetual beginning reweights every prior bottle and droplet without moralizing; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“parole-glow,” “mindfully scattered”—sustains a controlled, elevated register that never drifts into purple; perceptual signature is Merrick’s throughout, with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor scaffold in “droplets form and fall, quantifying absence” (near-paraphrase) but no loops or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of a floating library that metabolizes stories is fresh; the inversion of a forgettery into a perpetuity shop feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
