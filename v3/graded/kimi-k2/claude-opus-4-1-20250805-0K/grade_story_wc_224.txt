<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Oracle’s interiority is vivid, contradictory memories-versus-prophecy clash in scene, and final planting choice credibly renounces visions for tangible growth; mercury blindness adds embodied specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dream substitutions escalate into causal renunciation; lily-to-language-stone reprise at climax reweights past visions; mercury bowl remains coherent constraint under accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mountain chambers as rich micro-settings press choices—soil chamber forces kneeling, mercury pools constrain tactics, stone texture feels tactile; specificity earns high band.</comment>
