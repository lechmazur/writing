<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s silence is credibly rooted in vocation; her micro-choices (mirror angle, shutter choreography) reveal hierarchy of values. Thomas’s interior shift is embodied in breathing sync with canal, not told. Final gift of mirror crystallizes earned change with visible cost—loss of her tool, gain of his release. No contradictory impulses shown in scene, so 9+ test narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of light/shadow deepens until final image reweights meaning. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Thomas’s stance toward grief crystallizes; cost is Mira’s relinquished mirror and her perpetual vigil. Causality intact: each shutter opening tightens the lesson. No orientation drift; anchors set by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, wet planks, puddles, and shutters form micro-setting that actively constrains choices—mirror needs reflective surfaces, shutters modulate light. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Final star reflections in canal water charge the closing image. Weather and spatial choreography remain coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Thomas’s frozen confession—signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each shutter pattern tightens the emotional vise until the secret dissolves. Cost is legible: Mira gives away her mirror, Thomas walks away lighter. No external coincidence; pressure is situational and coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silent empathy emerges organically from action, never stated. Subtext carried in gesture, light, and withheld speech. Final image of stars “spoken in the language of light” offers non-literal, resonant answer. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about Mira’s own unspoken losses.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Mira’s perceptual signature—selective attention to water, light, and the boy’s breathing. Prose texture is lyrical yet disciplined; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats, accelerating during shutter sequences, breathing at close. Distinctive without overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences are dense, propulsive, and free of loops. Figurative language is purposeful—“spiralingly calm,” “stillwater tension”—and paid off in closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Micro-variations in syntax mirror the shutter choreography. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: dental mirror as silent teaching device, shutters as narrative loom. Familiar grief trope transformed through tactile light-play. Specificity of canal guardian role and cobalt dock anchors universals. Risky lyric compression succeeds; closure remains legible. No derivative echoes.</comment>
