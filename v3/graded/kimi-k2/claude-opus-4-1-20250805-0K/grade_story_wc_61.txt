<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Keeper’s motivation—tending stars to “share light without using fire”—is stated early and reiterated, but her interiority stays abstract (“troubling serenity,” “made peace with it”) rather than embodied. No contradictory impulse is dramatized; the gear and the sonar pings are handled, yet they never force a choice that costs her anything. The final beat is a static acceptance rather than an earned renunciation or decisive act. Characterization is atmospheric, not crucible-level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Charged Poise: she will “remember them all” when the last star dies. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern repetition with cadence shift from red-giant countdown to newborn star. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Cost is conceptual (eternal solitude) but only asserted, not dramatized on the page; hence the ceiling below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The nebula garden is rendered in luminous, selective strokes (“clouds of hydrogen…stellar flowers”). The gear and starlight bottles act as micro-settings that constrain her method of light-sharing. Spatial anchors hold through the folds-of-space transit. The setting never physically obstructs or endangers her, preventing 9-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: witness and preserve starlight across cycles. Pressure is existential/time rather than antagonistic; no tightening choice narrows options—she merely continues. The red-giant countdown offers a clock, yet its 3–4 kyr span doesn’t alter her tactics. Escalation is tonal, not tactical; cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical beauty and inevitable loss emerges through imagery rather than statement. The final image of the gear “turning, turning” reweights the earlier mechanical motif into a meditation on endless approximation of infinity. Avoids moralizing, but the conceptual cost of eternal solitude is more asserted than felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyrical, with controlled cosmic register (“quantum bottles,” “gravitational ripples”). Perceptual signature is ethereal yet precise. No dialogue; free-indirect texture remains coherent. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure—longer cadences for reflection, clipped clicks for the gear. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and imagistic yet clear; metaphors are coherent (“starlight like dew on spider silk”). Occasional stacked modifiers (“quiet sigh of falling petals”) flirt with overwriting but stay within pattern. No loops or scaffold. High information density; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cosmic-gardener trope is refreshed through tactile detail (gear as worn artifact, quantum bottles). Synthesis of astrophysics and elegy feels inevitable. Risk lies in the quiet lyric mode; it mostly succeeds but edges toward familiar cosmic melancholy. No derivative echoes detected.</comment>
