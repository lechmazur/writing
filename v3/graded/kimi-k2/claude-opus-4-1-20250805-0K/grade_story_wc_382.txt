<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her tactile memory of the cornerstone, the brass seal in her pocket—but the final “teach me” beat feels slightly under-motivated; we haven’t seen her hesitate or weigh cost, so the shift to mentor reads smooth rather than compelled. Marcus’s pressure is gentle yet legible, and their shared flaw (hearing buildings) crystallizes the relationship crucible. The earned cost is present but diffuse: she relinquishes solitude without dramatized fear of loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rooftop becomes a classroom, the meteor shower a living text, and the building’s murmur the first lesson. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (meteors, tea steam, shifting brick) tightens the cadence until the final image reweights the premise. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4. Cost is felt in the unspoken risk of shared knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The rooftop garden, meteor shower, and antique seal function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the open sky invites cosmic scale while the seal’s brass weight tethers Elara to human time. Sensory hierarchy is character-biased—she notices mortar temperature, not star magnitude. Final image of the building “adjusting its weight” charges the closure with embodied cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will Elara share her secret lexicon?—is signaled early and tightens once when Marcus asks to be taught. The deepening is subtle but causal: her refusal to remain sole translator forecloses isolation. Cost is legible in the unspoken fear of dilution, though it could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “architecture as agreed-upon lie” emerges through concrete particulars—wet mortar palm print, brass seal inscription—never abstract assertion. Final image of the building beginning its “midnight recitation” offers a resonant, non-literal answer: shared listening dissolves the lie into living truth. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—precise, tactile, slightly archaic without pastiche. Free indirect style stays clean; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s philologist bias. Dialogue carries subtext (“What did it say?” already knowing). No head-hopping; compression taught early (“celestial display seemed almost mundane”) and paid off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “meteor shower had begun precisely when…wax” packs time, action, and motif in one clause. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for reflection, fragments under meteor flash. Zero artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—buildings speak in dialects only certain people hear—is fresh yet grounded in sensory detail. The synthesis of dead languages and structural linguistics feels inevitable. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final rooftop lesson. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
