<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—reckless idealism vs. the orchard’s warning—are dramatized in the trembling reach for the apple; the final fusion of destinies is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (loss of singular self). Interiority is embodied and specific, though the keeper’s dialogue edges toward thematic exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bite reweaves two fates into a third path, ash of The Fool becoming promise. Causal linkage holds—each descent step narrows options until the decisive act—under a Causal lens. Cost is legible in the crumbling card and the irrevocable merger.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid, selective, and purposeful: roots threading bone constrain movement and choice, while the phosphorescent apples charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; the setting evolves with action rather than stalling it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mending the soul-hole via bartered destiny—is signaled early and tightened when Mara must choose between singular grief and fused purpose. Escalation is driven by her agency; the keeper’s warning raises cost without resolving conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: destiny as negotiable, love as transformative fusion. The final image of ash reshaping into promise offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture—the trembling reach, the crumbling card—rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet grounded; perceptual signature filters every detail through Mara’s fierce idealism and grief. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping or register drift. Keeper’s diction is slightly elevated but remains within ancient-keeper idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Occasional elevated phrasing (“dusky resolve settling into her bones like sediment”) risks overwriting but fits the heightened moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—destiny-apples grown from the dead—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Tropes of afterlife commerce and tarot are transformed through specific, embodied choices. Risk-taking (fusion of two souls into a third path) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
