<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—bone-conducted song, trembling hands, ancestral weight—yet the final transformation (“became what the artifact needed”) is asserted more than dramatized, blurring the cost of her renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira disperses into the beacon, a felt cost paid in her vanished body and folded coat. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each harmonic layer tightens until the final image reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is tactile—groaning platforms, frozen rivets, honey-blood sunset—and the lighthouse itself constrains every move, culminating in the beam that now carries Mira’s song. Micro-setting (vault door, suspension field) directly shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the artifact or lose the covenant—is signaled early and tightened by the Collectors’ boots on the ice. The final resonance forecloses return to human form, a visible price etched in the melted key.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of custodianship versus possession emerges through sonic covenant and ice-memory; the ending’s wordless song offers a non-literal answer that reweights earlier motifs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, tactile, and musically cadenced—“flesh could become a tuning fork”—with perceptual signature sustained even as Mira dissolves. No head-hopping; lyric compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“wings of forgotten birds”) is selective and purposeful. One minor loop—“the artifact responded, its light intensifying” followed by “could feel every molecule aligning”—slightly dulls the peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transforms lighthouse-keeper trope into sonic transubstantiation; the ice-covenant and vibrational absolution feel inevitable yet fresh. Risky dissolution ending is fully earned and heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
