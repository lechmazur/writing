<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“ice crystals formed on her eyelashes”), but her contradictory impulses remain abstract; the final surrender feels pre-destined rather than wrestled with, so the cost is legible yet not fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the astrolabe’s final turn releases trapped creativity and Lyra dissolves—an earned stasis with visible cosmic cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each meteor’s coordinate is seeded early and paid off in the white-hot auroral flare.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway and brass astrolabe function as micro-settings that constrain choice; temperature drop and ice on lashes ground the body. Selective sensory detail mirrors internal stakes, though the Viking echo is more postcard than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and tightened by the astrolabe’s warming pull. Agency is surrender rather than fight; the cost is cosmic dissolution, felt but slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of creativity as wild, dangerous necessity emerges through concrete action rather than statement. Final image of “river of stars” reweights the premise without moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether humanity is ready.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet controlled, with a stargazer’s perceptual signature—“liquid emerald,” “pulsars and quasars”—that never breaks POV. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“velvet darkness that seemed to breathe”) flirt with overwriting but pattern is taught early and paid off. No loops or scaffold; final cadence crystallizes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar cosmic-lyric tropes are transformed through tactile specificity and the fresh conceit of creativity imprisoned by ancient astronomers. Risky dissolution ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
