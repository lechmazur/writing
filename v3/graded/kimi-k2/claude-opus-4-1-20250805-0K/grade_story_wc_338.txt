<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s internal contradiction—precision vs. intuition—remains vivid; her micro-choice to film herself embodies shielded openness. Yet because no second character shares the vault the status bullets remain latent. Backstory is woven via the torn map cue; no knowledge leaks. Final cost is palpable when she presses palm to parchment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern accumulation reweights meaning to closure). Synchronizing the videos and the ultraviolet reveal function as because/therefore links culminating in Charged Poise: Elara’s act of filming her own silent testimony crystallizes the centuries-old ritual. Closure is on-page with visible cost; lens never wavers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault, the torn map edge, and the skylight drips become micro-settings that constrain Elara’s posture and tools; at closure the oil-stained tear itself guides her palm-print ritual. Anchors arrive by 2nd paragraph, spatial choreography remains clean. Environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—continuing the chapel’s wordless communion—tightens once with the UV reveal and again when she decides to reopen not the doors but the purpose. Escalation rides on pattern accretion, not reversals; cost is the decision to enter the ritual permanently. Agency is clear and escalation legible under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Communication through presence rather than words” arises organic from the monks, the homeless teens, and Elara’s final gesture. Theme is unsullied by direct statement; the fresco and map sustain a charged echo cycle that resists simple messaging. Emotion feels earned, not asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Narrative stance stays close-third, percussive rhythms echo rainfall and heartbeat. Word choice—“shielded openness,” “pigment into prophecy”—remains character-grounded. No POV drift; elision (1961 interior off-stage) is purposeful and closure-paying. Distinct perceptual signature intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Slight scaffold around “understand,” “understood,” “understanding” forms a minor loop but never muddles the final image. Density remains high without purple drift; metaphors (“peeling like old skin,” “continents across the walls”) stay local. No clarity loss at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The ancient henge as a silent congregation tool, transmitted through human skin oils and archived footage, feels fresh and specific. Quiet rebellion against literal cartography—using the map’s tear as path—creates a resonant synthesis rather than a twist. Emotional truth outweighs gimmick.</comment>
