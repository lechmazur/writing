<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is vivid—his “architecture of silence” and deliberate footfalls reveal a mind that weaponizes stillness. The possessed woman’s single line (“I am assumption”) crystallizes the demon as habit, not monster, but her agency is muted; she’s more canvas than character. The micro-choice—adjusting the loop pedal to sculpt absence—earns the exorcism, yet the cost to Marcus feels conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each loop layer thickens the “mandala of words” until silence itself becomes the decisive instrument. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the indigo palette clattering to reveal “the color of questions finally asked”—with the woman’s gasp as audible cost. Orientation is swift; cathedral acoustics and dimensional anchor are anchored by line 3. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cathedral’s resonance is treated as a living instrument; stones “confess their hidden tensions” under Marcus’s footfalls. The dimensional anchor and palette are micro-settings that constrain the exorcism’s geometry. Sensory hierarchy favors sound and color, narrowing to the indigo bleed that reweights the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from nave center to fallen palette.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Marcus un-possess the woman before the 17-minute mark without violence? Escalation is textural—each loop tightens the noose of silence around the demon’s “unexamined certainties.” The decisive turn is Marcus’s rhetorical spiral that forces the demon to articulate itself into dissolution. Cost is the woman’s reclaimed breath and the indigo’s revealed spectrum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the inverse relationship between silence and truth: stillness as active interrogation rather than absence. The palette’s indigo shift from concealment to doorway embodies the conceptual repricing. No moralizing; the final image of “decorated silence” invites reflection without dictation. Subtext lives in the loop pedal’s clicks and the woman’s muffled voice clearing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is ecclesiastical yet tactile—“cassock,” “nave,” “mandala”—with rhythmic control that mirrors the looping device. Compression is purposeful: “He decorated with silence the way other priests adorned with gold leaf.” No POV drift; perception stays strictly within Marcus’s sensorium. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-laden; the demon’s single line carries the weight of confession.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sound, color, and concept without redundancy. Metaphors are precise—“rooms within rooms of sacred silence”—and avoid mixed vehicles. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. Minor elevation in register (“conceptual repricing”) is voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The inversion of exorcism as acoustic architecture rather than violent expulsion feels inevitable yet fresh. The loop pedal as liturgical tool and the demon as “habit dressed in terror’s clothing” transform familiar tropes. Specificity of the indigo palette and dimensional anchor grounds the metaphysical conceit. Risk-taking (silence as weapon) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
