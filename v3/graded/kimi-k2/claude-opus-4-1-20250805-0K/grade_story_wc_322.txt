<question>1</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Chosen POV offers fever-state interiority and embodied emotion, yet interior risk/want hierarchy stays abstract until near end; the architect’s calm unsettles and choices alter gallery space, but final renunciation feels somewhat pre-declared rather than earned under escalating pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Apparent Causal lens via “as memories alter” holds; closure lands as Charged Poise reconfiguring perception, though orientation anchors (who/where) drift slightly until late. Cost (fever, body state) is visible yet feels summarized, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Gallery becomes living pattern medium; specific stairs and triangles constrain weaving choices in climax, charging ending image. Micro-setting of sinew-thread body-tool meets environment-body overlap.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can architecture remodel perception—tightens through erupting tapestries and spatial collapse. Mid-scene decision to weave memory-doubt narrows options; cost (liver flush, endurance) legible yet abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of texture of connection grows organically from repeated sensory shifts; final image reweights what “real” means without overt moralizing, leaving charged reflection rather than tidy conviction.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, oscillating syntax mirrors delirium without head-hop; perceptual signature (walls “breathe”) stays consistent; sinew-thread pulse and gallery distortion crystallize under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm propels; occasional over-ripe metaphors fade in density. Zero loops or scaffold, but indelible near-restates (“sinew thread sang / silvery filaments…”) verge on redundancy, shaving half-point.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fever-state architect defies stock “mage” cliché; combined motifs (weaving illusion-built structures) feel inevitable in hindsight, no close echoes in other texts. Risk of abstraction controlled by embodied cost.</comment>
