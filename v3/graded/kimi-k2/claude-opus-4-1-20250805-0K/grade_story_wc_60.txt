<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is vivid—his shift from skeptical tracker to ritual participant is embodied in the feather’s tremble and the box’s glow—but the woman remains a cipher; her “patient fury” is asserted, not dramatized, so relationship pressure is muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fountains’ first flow reweights the premise, and the cost—Marcus stays while the geese leave—is legible in the final image. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each fountain beat thickens pattern until the cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dry fountains as “mouths that had forgotten how to speak” and crystallized time as “thick and viscous as amber” anchor the surreal city; the stained glass box projects ghost-constellations that charge the final image, constraining Marcus’s choice to remain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—tightens once: each fountain touched narrows options until the final flow makes return impossible. Cost is felt in Marcus’s renunciation of departure; pressure escalates via pattern accumulation rather than causal reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory as compost emerges organically; the feather’s release reweights earlier anomalies without moralizing. Final image of “tomorrow’s constellations” offers non-literal resonance, though the woman’s line about “nourish something new” flirts with thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Luminous skeptic voice is distinct—compressed, lyric, and internally coherent; “sidereal patience” and “defiant hush” recur as patterned diction. No head-hopping; POV filters every detail through Marcus’s selective awe.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors (“compass needle refusing north”) are precise. Minor scaffold in “together, they walked to each fountain” could tighten, but no loops or register drift in peak beats; rhythm accelerates with the fountains’ awakening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of time-amber fountains and memory-feather keys feels inevitable; the geese as temporal snag is a non-obvious angle. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration without gimmickry.</comment>
