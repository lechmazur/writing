<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses (quest vs lingering loss) are fully embodied; her belief that thresholds feel holy is dramatized by the earth’s temperature shift and her decision to map her own codes. The cost—accepting a liminal existence instead of reunion—is visible on the page. Minor slip: “three degrees cooler” leans toward diagnostic weather-talk rather than embodied awe.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The story teaches an Accumulative/Textural pattern early (corn stalk language, grain mirroring wood) and returns a Charged Poise closure: Marina remains in the threshold circle, mapping codes that reconfigure possibilities instead of rescuing or burying a body. Orientation anchors inside the first 80 words; causality intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The drifting terrace glass, 7-foot row widths, 21-foot intersections, and 3-degree micro-climate all constrain her navigational choices and appear in the final image. Sensorial specifics (wood counter-spirals, ground-temperature palm feel) fuse setting with motive. No generic farm field; location specificity is vital.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why sacred distance exists—tightens when Marina must choose to honor her father’s crossing or demand return. The price is her own indefinite residence. Escalation lands when she kneels and feels the threshold, foreclosing the “find Dad” option. Cost is felt, not stated.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of sacred absence emerges organically; the final whisper–back reconfigures “loss” as continuous conversation across thresholds. No explicit moral. The pattern of mirrored spirals and pressure differentials gives the concept social and emotional weight without pronouncement. Resonant, non-literal.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Compressed lyric prose tracks Marina’s precise observational filter (“wood spiraled counterclockwise… corn whispered in fractured hush”). No head-hopping; narrator bound by embodiment. Slight drift into elevated diction at “sacred geometries” and “meteorological moment,” but the voice sustains intensity throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rich, musical syntax never falls into paraphrase loops. Information-dense lines (“the soil spiraled here, its grain matching…”) advance sense without filter verbs. One mixed metaphor—“corn exhaling in fractured hush”—slightly muddled, forgiven in the final rush.</comment>

<grade>8.6</question>
<comment>A 17-acre weather-encoded maze crossed by a drifting glass terrace is highly non-obvious. The central invention—loss as a literal atmospheric differential—resists re-skinned tropes. Risk is taken: no body, no ghost, only pressure thresholds. Resonates uniquely.</comment>
