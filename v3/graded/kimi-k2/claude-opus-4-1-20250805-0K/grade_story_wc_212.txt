<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (furiously tranquil precision) manifest in micro-choices under pressure. The arc from cautious heir to active steward is earned through her handling of the acorn cap and the vortex, with visible cost as she accepts the garden’s weight. No secondary characters on page, so relationship crucible not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the garden re-opens under Mira’s agency, crystallizing her stance with felt cost (“ready for the next keeper”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of seed-images and cadence shift reweight the stake. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint (temporal entropy) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Icebound atrium and crystalline dome anchor space early; the oak panels beneath the ice physically constrain the reopening and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—starlight, velvet texture of time—filtered through Mira’s seed-saver priorities. Micro-setting (acorn cap, suspended seeds) functions as active setting that constrains choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—reopen the sealed garden—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: spiral of seeds slows, ice sublimes, shoots appear; each intensification narrows options and raises cost. Agency is Mira’s alone; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful tightening: placing the cap reconfigures spacetime with irreversible commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of inheritance-as-continuation emerges through seed-memory and temporal stewardship, never stated outright. Subtext in the grandmother’s “protection” reframed as trust. Final image of new oak remembering both past and future offers resonant non-literal answer. Complexity preserved—power is gift and burden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual signature—seeds “hummed with summers that never were,” time “like velvet worn smooth.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadences under reflection, clipped precision during action. No head-hopping; diction remains within her lexicon. Distinct voice sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no scaffold. Metaphors are precise—seeds “compressed time,” “velvet of borrowed time”—and cohere. Occasional elevated diction (“sublime directly into vapor”) fits the lyric mode. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Temporal seed-saving as inheritance is fresh; combines Cherokee Purple tomatoes with pocket-dimension gardens without gimmickry. Transformation test passed—story would collapse if elements were generic. Risk in lyric time-bending pays off: closure remains legible and emotionally grounded. Specificity of “Glass Gem corn reflecting stars that might have been” feels inevitable.</comment>
