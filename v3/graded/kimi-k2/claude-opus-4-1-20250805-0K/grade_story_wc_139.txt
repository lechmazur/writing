<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s interior contradiction—honest daughter of a con artist—drives every micro-choice; the final “everything” lands as earned renunciation. Wei’s confusion and thaw feel credible under pressure. Minor slip: Wei's shift from rage to understanding is compressed almost to convenience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: Maya’s waiting, Wei’s breach, the envelope/ink-pot reveal, and the ash-for-ink reconfiguration all link cleanly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—ashes as ink—whose conceptual cost is unmistakable. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The prep-room’s chemical light, steel counter, and embalming tools constrain Maya’s ritual precision; the ink pot’s lacquer gleams under that same light in the final image, charging closure. Sensory selection stays urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—how to settle inherited guilt—tightens once when Wei appears and again when the envelope’s contents reweight the debt. Maya’s agency drives every beat; the cost is the father’s literal erasure into apology ink.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of “honest mathematics” emerges from concrete objects and choices; the final image of ashes-as-ink reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in gesture and silence carries the generational reckoning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and emotionally restrained; free indirect style stays consistent. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext (“That’s not enough”). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective (“liquid mercury,” “deathly vitality”) and never clutters high-pressure beats. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise—stolen heirloom, posthumous atonement—is transformed through the ashes-for-ink reversal and the honest-daughter angle. Specificity of embalming ritual and Chinese calligraphy history grounds the concept.</comment>
