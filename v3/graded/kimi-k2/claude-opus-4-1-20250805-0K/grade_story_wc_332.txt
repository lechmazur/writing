<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to resurrect her grandmother’s love yet sensing the personal cost—are dramatized in the final beats when she lowers the palette. Interiority is specific and embodied; the warmth leaving her chest is a concrete price. The renunciation is earned and forecloses the path of further vitalizations, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Only the slight abstraction in “luminous absence” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara’s refusal dissolves the figure and costs her the dream she has pursued for seven years. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each dawn’s light-painting session layers density until the final palette-set-down crystallizes the reconfiguration. Causality is intact; no teleporting props or retroactive patches. The cost is legible in the sentence “she felt something leaving her own chest.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The archipelago’s copper water and breathing air are vivid, selective, and filtered through Mara’s perceptual bias. The palette itself functions as micro-setting, constraining her final choice when she sets it down. Spatial choreography across the skiff and island edge is coherent. Only a touch of postcard phrasing in “molten copper” keeps it shy of 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—complete the vitalization or keep her own heart open—is signaled early and tightened once: the figure’s outstretched hand forces the choice. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency under the Accumulative lens; the cost is unmistakable as her own capacity for love drains away. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the refusal is hers alone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: some longings are meant to remain luminous ciphers. The final image of the dissolving figure offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the silence after the whispers soften. The insight is earned through the concrete sacrifice of her own warmth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature—“the air itself seemed to breathe.” Patterned elision (no direct dialogue) is taught early and paid off at closure. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; the final paragraph’s cadence slows into acceptance. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective—“molten copper,” “cipher of longing”—and never muddles clarity. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. A single mixed metaphor risk in “luminous absence” is minor and does not obscure the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of memory-vitalization through dawn light feels inevitable yet fresh; the grandmother’s unlived love encoded in landscape is a non-obvious angle. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors the universal—“salt-stained pages,” “weathered hands”—preventing template drift.</comment>
