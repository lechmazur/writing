<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is textured and embodied; the contradiction between pacifist creed and strategic scheming is dramatized in the tactile handling of the music box and the silent plan. The Magistrate’s cellular-memory epiphany is earned by prior cueing and carries visible cost (the loosening grip). Minor slip: “scheming mind already three moves ahead” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the Magistrate’s stance crystallizes with felt cost (soundless weeping, cradling the box). Causal chain holds: broken pin → cellular memory → fever breaks. One seamless scene, anchored early, no orientation drift. Lens is Causal with Accumulative texture; pattern taught and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sanctuary’s absolute silence is not backdrop but active constraint—communication by touch, rage visible as warped air. The music box’s metal memory and the stones’ confessional imprint charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis. Meets 9+ gate: the setting’s rule-set directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teach release of inherited resentment—signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the Magistrate’s arrival forces the test. Escalation is one meaningful deepening: cellular memory rewrites rage into grief, foreclosing vengeance. Cost is legible in the father’s silent tears and the unbroken fever’s imminent break. Agency remains Marcus’s throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the cellular memory conceit and the broken music box: violence is a transmissible pattern that can be unlearned only by releasing the old melody. Final image of the box cradled like a child offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in touch-based dialogue and silent weeping deepens complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through tactile silence. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer cadences in reflection, clipped fragments during the Magistrate’s entry. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Marcus. Dialogue-free design is consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and patterned (“reality bent like water around stones”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm breathes with emotional beats. Minor elevated diction (“cellular memory,” “metamorphosis”) stays within Marcus’s scholarly lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses speculative cellular memory with monastic pacifist strategy; the soundless sanctuary and touch-only communication feel fresh yet inevitable. Broken music box as teaching tool is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk in silent dialogue pays off through embodied subtext. No derivative echoes.</comment>
