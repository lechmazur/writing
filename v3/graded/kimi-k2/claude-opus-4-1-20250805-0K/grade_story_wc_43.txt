<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “decisively kind hands that never tremble” crystallizes her stance under terminal pressure. The broken vinyl and the album project externalize her contradictory impulses (serene vs. fractured) and force a costly choice: spend her last weeks on a gift that will outlive her. Motivation stays rooted in her vocation; the final bow is earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor slip: Dr. Williams functions more as sounding board than crucible, so relationship pressure is thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the framed vinyl circle reweights the premise—every ending is continuation—while the cost is Maya’s literal departure. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of recorded hospice sounds intensifies until the final montage reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift; rooftop, dawn, test envelope all anchored by 120 words. One transition (weeks later) is clean. No causality breaks; the album’s creation is the tightening beat.</comment>

<comment>The Radiant Haven is more than postcard: its glass walls, bamboo rustle, and eye-level clouds constrain the gathering and amplify the final sunlight “like an anthem.” Micro-setting objects—harp, broken vinyl, tea scent—are handled repeatedly and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible positions. Environment subtly mirrors Maya’s split self (earth/sky, cracked/whole). Could edge higher if weather or altitude had altered tactics, but still strong.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—how to say goodbye while teaching the living—signaled early and tightened by the four-week countdown. Escalation is accumulative: each recording session layers stakes until the final playback forces communal recognition. Cost is Maya’s finite time and her literal exit; no coincidence resolves anything. One meaningful deepening suffices; the album premiere is the decisive intensification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty in transience, continuity in fracture. Subtext lives in gesture—the vinyl halves fitting “cracked but whole” speaks louder than any thesis. Final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Complexity is honored; no tidy uplift. The scent of hope and the rooftop light become non-literal answers to mortality’s question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in hospice detail; perceptual signature is Maya’s synesthetic caregiving ear. Syntax modulates with emotional crests—long breaths in garden stillness, clipped phrases when she says “I have a different kind of timeline.” No head-hopping; POV stays locked. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext (“You’re early”). Compression in time skips is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective—“sunlight filled the space like an anthem” lands because it’s earned. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; paragraph cuts are purposeful. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise—hospice soundscape as farewell art—is fresh and specific. Broken vinyl as metonym for fractured/whole life is transformed through action, not symbol tacked on. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in communal listening moment. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; no derivative echoes. Bold yet coherent.</comment>
