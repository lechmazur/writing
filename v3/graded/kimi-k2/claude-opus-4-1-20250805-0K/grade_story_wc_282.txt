<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira’s interiority is vivid—her fingertips “taste” temperature, the fossil’s warmth against her chest—but the final choice to “teach others to hear” is asserted rather than dramatized; no micro-choice in-scene shows the cost of that commitment. The contradiction between her solitary mapping and communal mission is stated, not embodied in a beat that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fossil crumbles, unlocking perception of the alien presence, and Kira’s role pivots from observer to translator. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each thermal layer deepens the pattern until the final reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the fossil’s dissolution and the implied burden of bridging species.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The coastal cave breathes with tide and limestone memory; the electromagnetic harness and bioluminescent constellations are tactile constraints that shape Kira’s floating movement. The fossil’s warmth against skin and the alien thermal palette charge the final image, making environment, tool, and body inseparable from choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping the unknown consciousness—tightens when the alien signature appears; Kira’s agency shifts from documentation to translation, foreclosing pure observation. The cost is the fossil’s loss and the unspoken burden of interspecies dialogue. One clear escalation suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of post-human continuity emerges through thermal residues and the fossil’s bridge-function; no moral is stated. The final image—Kira drawing “maps of tomorrow’s emotions”—reweights the premise without didacticism, letting the alien presence remain ambiguous yet consequential.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is sensorily precise—“fingertips that could taste temperature variations”—and rhythm modulates with Kira’s drift from curiosity to solemn acceptance. Compression and lyric elision are consistent; no POV leakage. The perceptual signature is distinct and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers sensory data and concept without redundancy. Occasional elevated phrasing (“emotional topology”) fits the augmented POV. No loops or mixed metaphors; the fossil’s crumbling is rendered with tactile economy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-hibernation Earth, thermal emotion science, and emergent non-human consciousness feels inevitable yet fresh. The fossil-as-key and caves-as-mind are transformed tropes, not ornaments. Risky speculative leaps land because grounded in sensory specificity.</comment>
