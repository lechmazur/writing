<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Marcus’s calm rebellion and Elena's discovery drive the beat sequence; their embodied micro-choices (cobblestone fog entry, pawn forward) link motive to final image. Interior monologue avoids therapy-speak while Elena's sobbing body anchors emotion. The earned “Checkmate” moment seals renunciation with visible social cost foreclosing the old order. A hairline slip: education-director threat remains offstage, so status dynamics rely mostly on Elena's line about father. Overall high but not exemplary at the 9-test bar.</comment>

<comment>The closure is a resonant reconfiguration—townwide awakening crystallized in “Checkmate”—fulfilling Conceptual Repricing with social cost. Causal linkage (pawn → window display → chorus of parents) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One minor drift: late off-page arrival of the education director weakens concrete escalation compared to earlier on-page pressures. Still, cause/effect chain supports the uplift and earns its end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Cobalt-blue stone wall fog and starlight magnetic grotto are vivid, selective, and purposeful; the grotto itself levitates pieces to enable the closing tableau, fulfilling 9-gate test. Spatial anchors (church bells at nine, window sequence) keep town choreography legible. Sensory detail narrows under rising stakes, always filtered through Marcus’s teacher-gaze. Fully integrated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—free thought versus systemic suppression—is introduced at “They’re watching” and tightened until Elena’s “He says you're teaching us to overthrow.” Final image forecloses the old compliance: townspeople physically move with boards in hand, a felt price. Escalation accumulates through the 9-o’clock cascade, not reversals, consistent with lens. Clean cost visibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>The theme of mental rebellion emerges from concrete choices (hovering knight in pharmacy window) rather than explicit statement. Quiet reprise of “Checkmate” reweights the premise with conceptual—now political—cost. Subtext in Elena's whisper carries irony: “but we learn to question why anyone should lose.” No tidy moral offered; instead the silence after the last line provokes enduring reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Warm, rhythmic free-indirect style (“They know”) stays consistent; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature in Marcus’s synesthesia-esque hearing of the library heartbeat. Pulsing cadence syncs with escalating 9-o’clock sequence, breath matching urgency. Final line crystallizes without external voice creep; lyric compression remains purposeful and legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dense but clean: every sentence does double duty (magnetic grotto breathes with stakes). Minor tightening needed: “carrying... carrying” in two adjacent clauses is a synonym loop—penalty offset by overall propulsion. Figurative logic stays coherent; cobalt mist never contradicts magnetic lift. Read-aloud euphony strong with strategic breathing pauses at paragraph cuts.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.4</question>
<comment>Rebellion-as-chess-lesson is a non-obvious synthesis that remains locally fresh. Transformation test shows premise would collapse without precise details—magnetic grotto and starlit town synchrony. Risky lyric structure heightens meaning without gimmickry; 1930-photo feel of windows recalls Soviet dissident tactics but lands as unique. Closure recharges earlier motif in one seamless breath.</comment>
