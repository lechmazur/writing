<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Vera is etched sharply: ruthless designer who can still softly tremble over an egg. Interiority vividly tracks the gulf between public genocide and private grief, fueling every beat. The contradiction—cancelling rain yet burying life—drives her final renunciation with earned, bitter cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot compresses a single, chronological scene of burial-at-drought to hammer the closure image: salvation looking identical to annihilation. Each step advances because/therefore causality under a Causal lens; pressure tightens as each manipulation forecloses another water source. The ending’s conceit—thunder diverted north—pays off the setup with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Salt flat functions as both grave and loudspeaker, its crystalline acoustics amplifying the parakeet’s absent song. Cracks provide legs for the drought-drawn map, dictating where Vera kneels. Specific sensory sandblasts skin and conscience, anchoring stakes in tactile desiccation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Escalation coils around manufactured drought: each redirected storm constricts agency and raises the stakes of extinction. Cause/effect linkage narrows options—rivers cracked open, storms stolen—culminating in the hard choice to salt-entomb the egg. Cost is legible: loss of rainfall, of future birds, and of moral reputation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of grace-through-devastation refracts every action: conservation driven by catastrophe, sorrow routed through sabotage. Vera’s monuments—scars, salt, thunderless sky—provide a charged image that reweights both hope and indictment. No tidy moral, only a resonant, crystallized sadness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is cool, exacting science dropped into elegy: “manufactured catastrophe,” “impossible stamina” of satellites. Filtered grief colors every observation—thunder “that would never arrive.” Syntax modulates between terse commands and reverent softness, keeping the amoral philanthropist’s cognition intact and singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive—compressed through elliptical weather-tech jargon salted with mournful lyricism. No loops; each clause sharpens stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“acoustic fossil beds”) is voice-motivated, legible under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh twist on eco-horror: drought as deliberate archive of extinct songs. Specific inscription—fissure map, egg entombment—renders the concept unique and irreplaceable. An astonishment that sorrow must be built like a weapon.</comment>
