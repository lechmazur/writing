<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Amara’s interiority flickers between awe and vertigo under the retrocognitive split, and her embodied micro-decisions (palming glass, anchoring the zeppelin, walking the shore while constructing the message) reveal motivation rooted in a historian’s compulsion. Marcus as ghost-guide is cleanly tethered to 1961 without drifting into exposition. Cost shows: she accepts that preserving the movement’s myth demands swallowing specific betrayals. A slight abstract drift in “courage required to face the truth” drags it down from top tier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hinged on the Accumulative/Textural lens, retrocognitive lock-up becomes the persistent constraint forcing new tactics: the diary’s encrypted pages are read, parley initiated, debris cipher enacted, and closure crystallizes as mirrored lagoon libraries multiplying “an infinity of floating…”—a resonant reconfiguration that makes the before/after legible. Cost endures: the betrayal names remain unnamed in the archive but burned into Amara’s stance. One minor seam in the cause-effect chain: no overt cue how “arrange the debris” bridges to diary decryption mechanics on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is re-anchored as hidden beneath Saharan dunes, but every mention serves plot: surface mirroring zeppelins, black water reflecting the past, shore furnishing cipher stones—in every case the setting constrains the cipher pattern itself. Z-axis choreography (three-thousand-foot float, descent, anchor, lagoon’s black mirror for the final CR) remains spatially airtight. Sensory richness is selective—sand, wood, water, glint—biased through Amara’s archivist attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: will the archive admit messy betrayals at the cost of its heroic myth? Pressure tightens only once—when Amara accepts the burden after Marcus’s last fade—but that suffices under an Accumulative lens; the cost is the archive’s forever-complicated catalog. No escalation externalities; one crystallization, cleanly under the chosen lens.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme emerges organically in the tension between history and hagiography; no overt theme statements until the closing lines, and even there the language stays scene-linked. The mirror-river ending recasts prior stakes as an “infinity of floating libraries”—a Conceptual Repricing that forces audience to re-read betrayal as choice rather than indictment. Emotional aftereffect is specific, not didactic.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question>
<comment>Free-indirect archivist voice is consistent, with diction that mirrors activist vernacular (“surveilled”, “myth survive intact”). Retrocognitive POV slips are deliberate and paid off—a seamless temporal braid rather than head-hop. Syntax flexes under temporal vertigo without losing clarity; one clunky “concealment-resumed-eternal” cadence slightly deadens rhythm.</question>

<comment>Sentence propulsion is generally smooth: concrete nouns, active verbs, no paraphrase loops. One line-level hiccup: “a tear inside her mind” edges therapeutic rather than embodied. Otherwise density is high without clutter; paragraph cuts are purposeful and visual rhythm balanced.</question>

<comment>Encryption = history itself is a fresh inflection on diary tropes; placing the movement’s secret meetings beneath Saharan dunes via retrocognitive archivist is non-obvious. Some inherited scaffolding (magical lagoons, floating zeppelin libraries) borders fable, and risk is muted by lyrical execution. Nevertheless, the specific reweighting of betrayal-as-forgiveness makes it feel inevitable in hindsight.</question>
