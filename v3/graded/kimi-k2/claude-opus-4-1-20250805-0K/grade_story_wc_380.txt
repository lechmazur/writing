<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses—yearning to reclaim Elena yet choosing to re-bury the memories—are dramatized through tactile micro-choices (digging, lifting, returning the vial). The final renunciation carries visible cost: she keeps only one vial, accepting the ache. Interiority is embodied, not labeled. Minor slip: “crystalline clarity” edges toward diagnostic speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Marina reseals the grave, foreclosing reunion with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned images (coffee, salt, flowers) tighten until the final lantern-flame reconfigures meaning. Causality is intact; no orientation debt. One hairline slip: the whale’s causal role is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The salt-crystal chamber, cemetery gravity pockets, and lantern flames are vivid, selective, and directly constrain Marina’s movements and choices. The whale’s body functions as macro-setting that warps micro-settings. Final lantern image recharges earlier motifs. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to reclaim or release Elena’s memories—is signaled early and tightened by the exhume act. One meaningful deepening: Marina’s realization that grief was surgically removed. Cost is visible when she reseals the grave and pockets a single vial. Agency drives the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory, grief, and the ethics of forgetting emerges organically from Marina’s choice; no moralizing. The pressed wildflowers and salt vials reweight each other in silence. Final image of lanterns bending toward hidden graves offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Marina’s perceptual signature—salt spirals, gravity-tilted headstones, lantern flames bending. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Occasional elevated diction (“crystalline clarity”) slightly jars but does not rupture voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise and internally consistent. Minor overwriting in “gleaming silence” phrase repeated, but it serves pattern. Rhythm accelerates during dig and slows for closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-extraction as literal gravity surgery, whale as grief-magnet, coffee-ground divination—all grounded in Marina’s specific loss. Risky structure (lyric accumulative) pays off in charged final image. No derivative echoes; concept commits fully.</comment>
