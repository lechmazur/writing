<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kira’s interiority is vivid (“Words are prisms” whispered to bone) and her motives intensify from childish curiosity to deliberate sabotage. The contradiction between forgiveness and destruction is embodied in her final act, not merely stated. Yet the Silencers remain off-page abstractions, so status dynamics and secondary pressure are absent, capping depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ossuary becomes a transmitter of irreducible multiplicity, costing the Silencers their monopoly. Causal chain—childhood echo experiments → canyon acoustics → resonance chamber hijack—holds. Orientation is immediate; no temporal drift. The cost is legible in the final image: “the sound of a world learning to speak again.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon acoustics are not backdrop but tactical infrastructure: handholds, resonance chamber, echo multiplication. Sensory selection is urgent—cold bone, visible breath, spiraling mist—filtering through Kira’s artist-perception. The setting constrains every move and charges the final image of the spire pulsing with new purpose.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shattering the Silencers’ monopoly—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is accumulative: each added voice refracts the forbidden truth, tightening the noose around the single narrative. The final cost is conceptual rather than corporeal, but unmistakable: the ritual space is already lost to polyphony.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the refractive action itself: truth as prismatic water, not blade. No moralizing speech; the canyon’s new song is the non-literal answer. The ending reweights “forgiveness” from Silencer currency to collective risk, with lingering ambiguity about whether the Silencers will ever “understand.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating from hushed awe to incantatory climax. Syntax mirrors acoustic layering: short clauses echo, longer sentences refract. Compression (“They would find…”) is taught early and paid off. No POV leakage; perception stays anchored to Kira’s artist-sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and concept (“morning mist coiled around its pale surface”). Metaphors are coherent—light through water, sound through bone—without purple overload. No loops or scaffold; rhythm accelerates toward the final pulse. Occasional elevated diction (“ossuary prison”) is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise fuses dystopian silencing with acoustic physics in a way that feels inevitable yet fresh. The bone-tower ossuary reframed as amplifier is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk is high—lyric mode, conceptual stakes—but coherence never wavers. Specificity (“carved handholds that previous prisoners had left”) grounds the invention.</comment>
