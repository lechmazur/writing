<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her quiet rebellion encoded in rhythmic tapping, her simultaneous fear and resolve embodied in the crystalline barrier. The contradiction between compliance and subversion is dramatized in real time, culminating in the earned renunciation of individual survival for collective dream-life. The only drag is a slight drift toward diagnostic self-awareness (“she knew what they didn’t”) that edges into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s dissolution births a living collective dream, cost paid in her physical death. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each drummed pattern and memory shard layers density until the final auroral bloom reweights the premise. Causality is intact; no late rule changes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are not mere backdrop; their acoustic flowers and memory-waters constrain tactics and ultimately absorb the laboratory itself. Sensory specificity is selective—heartbeat-synced pulses, auroral sorrow—filtered through Mira’s dying perception. The garden’s final bloom charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Mira preserve individual identity or seed a collective dream?—is signaled early and tightens once: the moment she releases the encoded rhythm, foreclosing escape. Cost is visceral: her body fails as the dream proliferates. Agency drives escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as living creation rather than extractable data. The final image of the garden singing with undying voices offers a non-literal, resonant answer—no moralizing, only transformation. Subtext in the drumming and the scientists’ refusal to meet her eyes deepens the critique.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating from clinical detachment to incantatory surrender. Perceptual signature is distinct—Mira notices resonance patterns, auroral sorrow, the hush between heartbeats. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language serves pattern rather than ornament. Minor loop risk in “auric lagoon under starlight” echo, but rhythm accelerates under pressure. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—harvesting dying memories—feels fresh, yet the inversion into collective dream-generation is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of encoded drumming and acoustic flowers anchors the concept. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
