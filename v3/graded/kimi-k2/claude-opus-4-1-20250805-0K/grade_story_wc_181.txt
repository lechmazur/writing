<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“temporal vertigo,” “tongue felt thick”), but the final choice—biting the apple—leans on inherited epiphany rather than a fresh micro-choice that visibly costs her something new. The contradiction between duty and wonder is present yet never forces a fork in her path; she simply accepts the loop. Still, the curator’s perceptual signature is distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the apple bite crystallizes the closed causal loop with undeniable cost—she now inhabits paradox as vocation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each image (blossoms, shell, orchard) accrues meaning until the final reconfiguration. Orientation is deliberately disorienting but taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The astral orchard is no backdrop; its vacuum-blooming trees and upward-falling petals physically stage the temporal paradox, constraining movement and perception. Micro-setting (the bark-grown lavatory) provides the only refuge where reflection can occur. Every sensory detail is filtered through the curator’s trained eye, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—whether to accept recursive inheritance—tightens once when she carves the message she will later find. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt until the final bite. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge precedes itself, inheritance is a circle. The refrain “Inheritance follows no timeline” is earned through the shell’s blankness and the apple’s paradoxical taste. Final image reweights all prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under temporal vertigo. Compression (“simply complicated”) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains singular and curator-specific throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image, concept, and motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors are coherent (“juice ran silver like liquid starlight”). Line-level craft supports the accumulative design without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The pistachio-shell time-loop is a fresh synthesis of museum curation and ontological paradox. Risky structure pays off: the orchard, the bathroom epiphany, and the apple bite feel inevitable in hindsight. Specificity anchors the speculative conceit.</comment>
