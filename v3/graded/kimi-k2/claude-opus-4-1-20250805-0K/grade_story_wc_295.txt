<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is specific—her fingertip on the telegram, her fatigue, her “strange resonance” when speaking—but the moment of choice (placing the memory card) is under-dramatized; we see the gesture but not the internal contradiction that would make it cost. The previous chronicler’s madness is reported, not embodied, so the inherited burden feels second-hand. Still, her voice is distinct and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain—telegram → shared dreams → star pattern match → communal realization → archival act—lands a clean Conceptual Repricing: the “ancient relay” re-weights their isolation into stewardship. Closure is on the page and carries cost: they accept an endless vigil. Orientation is swift; the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The observatory dome, brass telescope, and starlight whispers are vivid and selective; the daylily’s “orange petals translucent as stained glass” returns at the end to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear; bodies and tools track cleanly. Environment constrains choice: the dome’s silence and the star clocks force the communal stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—shouldering cosmic truth without madness—tightens when the star pulses match the dream symbols; the cost is the acceptance of perpetual witness. One clear deepening suffices. Agency is collective rather than individual, but the shared burden is dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the relay of knowledge across generations; the daylily and telegram embody transience versus stellar permanence. The ending’s image of “listen with your dreams” offers resonant non-moral wisdom. Subtext is present but occasionally nudged toward the explicit (“we were wrong about everything”).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mira’s perceptions; diction is precise (“lucid dream chronicler,” “morse code written across millennia”) without purple drift. Dialogue is minimal but natural. Voice is consistent; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective (“whale song” for star audio). No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual loneliness”) is earned by context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of lucid-dream archives, variable-star Morse, and generational relay feels fresh; the daylily as one-day bloom is a specific, non-obvious emblem. The premise commits fully without gimmickry.</comment>
