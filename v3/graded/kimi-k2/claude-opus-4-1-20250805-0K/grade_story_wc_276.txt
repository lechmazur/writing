<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kova’s cool-headedness is embodied in micro-choices—steady breath, deliberate zigzag cast, refusal to panic—yet the interior contradiction (heart hammering against practiced stillness) is dramatized rather than labeled. The rail spike’s warming and the echo’s transliteration of her emotions make the cost visible. The final acceptance of the goddess’s echo reconfigures her voice, foreclosing the old fisher identity with felt cost. Only the grandmother backstory is summary, not re-weighted, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Kova gains the goddess’s echo, her voice now “ready to be cast forward into the world’s wounds,” a crystallized stance with undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern break of dawn, star-drifts, and transliterated blooms intensify until the final lullaby blooms winter flowers. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. The only hairline slip is the off-stage grandmother anecdote, but it doesn’t touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The sound-wave garden is not backdrop but active constraint: Kova must step between emotion-made-thorns, cast lines through vertical rivers of resonance, and endure phosphorescent star-rain that re-tunes frequencies. The rail spike’s iron song and the transliterated amber/violet currents charge the final image. Spatial choreography is exact; no white-room syndrome. Environment, tool, and body together force tactics and shape closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—catch the goddess’s echo—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened through each transliterated emotion and star-drift. Agency is exercised in the zigzag cast and the sustained voicing of silence; the echo’s choice to be held is earned, not given. Cost is visible: the rail spike burns, her own emotions externalized and judged, identity altered. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between pattern and wildness: “some songs never die, they just learn to swim in different seas.” No moralizing; the final lullaby reweights every prior pattern-break without statement. Subtext lives in gesture—silence voiced, iron bending, stars dreaming. The ambiguity lingers: is the gift cure or curse? Complexity embraced, no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to acoustic texture and star-movement. Syntax modulates with pressure—long languid clauses in calm moments, clipped fragments as the echo bites. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Kova’s sensorium. The diction (“feral lullaby,” “departed music”) is character-bound, not ornamental.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image, emotion, and world-rule. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene needs—silence shaped into syntax. Only one near-repeat (“patterns break themselves” echoed in “when patterns break themselves”) but it serves as deliberate reprise, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</question>
<comment>The synthesis—fishing for echoes in a sound-wave garden under sleepwalking constellations—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Tropes of celestial dreaming and goddess-whispers are transformed through Kova’s tactile, occupational practice. Risk is taken with lyric non-linear escalation, but coherence never wavers. The final winter-blooming lullaby is unforeseeable yet earned.</comment>
