<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina’s ghostly altruism is vivid and embodied, but her interiority is sketched more than dramatized; the brass bell’s final materialization is a powerful earned cost, yet her contradictory impulse (linger vs. fade) is stated rather than enacted in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly with Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s fall and engraved message crystallize communal unity at Marina’s expense. Causal chain (messages → soil sharing → network discovery) is tight; only a slight ellipsis in how the mycologist’s insight spreads weakens the final beat.</comment>

<comment>The floating stone arches and crimson sky anchor early and return in the final image; the orchards’ soil networks and chalked sidewalks are tactile and choice-constraining. Sensory selection is purposeful, though “brambled hope” verges on label.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—orchard survival—tightens as fences fall and root systems interweave. One clear escalation: discovery that blight resistance requires cross-boundary cooperation, forcing collective action with visible communal cost.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of collective vs. suspicion emerges organically from grafting and shared soil; final chalk line “Strangers built this world…” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the bell’s warmth and children’s play carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person omniscient ghost-POV is stable; diction is lyrical yet controlled, e.g., “nebula of respite.” Compression and patterned repetition (“watched them all…”) are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective—“despair made visible”—and never muddles causality. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors fading light and bell chime, charging the image.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Altruistic ghost + orchard blight + chalk messages is a fresh synthesis; the living fungal network as social metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky choice of ghost narrator pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
