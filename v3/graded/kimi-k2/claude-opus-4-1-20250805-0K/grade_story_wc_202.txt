<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—protective reverence vs. the need to expose—are dramatized in the scrape of palette knife on canvas; the cost is the irreversible alteration of the painting and the burden of carrying the map. Interiority is specific, embodied, and tied to her grandmother’s indigo-stained hands. The final renunciation (museum vs. between-worlds) is earned and forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira pockets the transformed painting, accepting the lifelong task of projection. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each scraped flake adds density until the map is legible. Cost is visible in the ruined canvas and the weight of “permission to unfasten the past.” Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rope-bridge market, chimney stacks, and indigo-stained hands function as micro-settings that constrain movement and supply the palette knife. The lighthouse’s painted constellation is a charged object that guides the final choice. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira’s translator’s eye; no static cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor erased histories—tightens when scraping the painting becomes irreversible. One meaningful deepening: the realization that the stars exist only in art forces the choice to project stories in fog. Agency is Mira’s; coincidence complicates (the fragment’s survival) but does not resolve. Cost is the destroyed canvas and the lifelong burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of scraping paint to liberate encoded light; no explicit moralizing. The final image—stories dancing in fog—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how erased voices can resurface. Subtext lives in the indigo stains and the grandmother’s hand-signs. Complexity is preserved: colonial erasure is not tidily reversed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a translator’s perceptual signature: “read the spaces between languages,” “constellation that appeared only in paintings.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences for reverie, clipped fragments during scraping. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to Mira’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers meaning without redundancy. Figurative language is controlled—no mixed metaphors. “Unfasten what time has bound” is earned by the act that follows. No loops or scaffold; high information density sustains momentum to the final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy, rooftop markets, and light-encoded language feels inevitable and fresh. The lighthouse lens as translator-device transforms a familiar maritime relic into a vessel for erased narratives. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure pays off: the painting becomes map, key, and burden without gimmickry.</comment>
