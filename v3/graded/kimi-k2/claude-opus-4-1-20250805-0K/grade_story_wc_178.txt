<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s frugality and devotion are embodied in tactile choices (barley bread, rainwater, saved coins) and culminate in the final sealing act; the interior contradiction between poverty and purpose is dramatized, not stated. The cost—her entire life of deprivation—is legible in the smile that closes the covenant. Minor slip: “empirically ironic” is used as label rather than dramatized contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the palace awakens, the covenant is sealed, and Mara’s lifelong frugality is repriced as the price of first contact. Causal chain holds: deciphering → tile removal → harmonic resonance → beacon activation. One micro-turn—tile warming under planetary alignment—tightens options decisively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The palace’s star-cut ceiling, phosphorescent mortar, and resonant stones are not backdrop but active encryption engine; the magic square tile physically constrains the final act. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through Mara’s astronomical priorities—starlight angles, planetary orbits—anchoring reader orientation early.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove that devotion measured in years and numbers can bridge cosmic distance—is tested by the escalating resonance that demands her voice and charts as final currency. Pressure tightens once: Mars aligns, tile warms, palace awakens; no reversal, but the narrowing is decisive and irreversible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the fusion of measurement and mysticism: devotion as empirical method. The final image of amber light reweights every prior act of frugality into scientific instrument. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in what intelligence now watches back.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is precise, archaic-tinged, and mathematically sensuous—“dusky harmony,” “orthogonal to time”—without purple drift. Compression is purposeful; patterned elision (“something watching from between them”) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinctly Mara's.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers starlight, stone, and number. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (“light gentle as sunset through amber”) are controlled and coherent. Rhythm accelerates with the palace’s hum, then crystallizes in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Transforms the trope of “ancient alien contact” into a quiet epiphany earned by architectural numerology and lifelong austerity. The palace as beacon, devotion as encryption—specific, non-obvious, inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off without clarity loss.</comment>
