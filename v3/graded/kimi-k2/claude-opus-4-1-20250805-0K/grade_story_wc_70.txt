<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s involuntary honesty and secret beekeeping create credible internal tension, and her final broadcast renunciation feels earned. Some emotional labeling (“terror,” “disappointment”) is generic, but embodied moments like the warm lacquer box under her palm compensate. Flawed, specific interiority holds steady. Earned stasis at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causality is clear: blackout → drone failure → Mira’s theft confession → broadcast hope. Closure lands on-screen as she risks everything to reveal the bees, paying the cost of potential arrest. Lens held causal to the final image. Minor telegraphing in dialogue slightly softens surprise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The tower functions as micro-setting: copper coils still warm guide scent memory, glass chamber steals lightning power. Specific object relations (lacquer box vibration) and spatial choreography are coherent. Environment constrains Mira’s choices and supplies resources for the hive. Final beam of dusk over dark grid recharges stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Surge failure and declining vertical farms raise clear stakes; Mira’s theft of tower energy intensifies cost. One decisive tightening: the broadcast locks options and risks criminal exposure. Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Causal lens. Could be sharper on city-scale consequences to reach 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—“wonder in darkness” via bees—emerges through concrete events (drone corpses on rooftops). Final renunciation crystallizes hope without moralizing; subtext carries in collective wonder. Resists tidy moral and focuses on particulars. Nectar dusk tone supports without cliché.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature (“copper coils warm from…”); present-tense urgency maintains pressure. Compressed diction under confession fits stress. No head-hopping. Minor over-labored phrasing (“liquid gold”) nudges down.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>High information density, vivid sensory detail woven through action. Rhythm varies naturally. Minor recall of sweetness metaphors recurs without pattern but doesn’t stall momentum. Occasional elevated register (“rendered negligence”) feels slightly stiff amid urgency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The bees-as-ray-of-hope synthesis feels inevitable once revealed; risk is taken by broadcasting felony. Tropes familiar (last beekeeper) are redeemed by specific detail and felt cost. Final image of citizens surrounding the chamber is fresh and earned.</comment>
