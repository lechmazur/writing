<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s interior contradiction—wealthy yet unfulfilled, gifted yet static—drives every beat; the tactile intuition trait is embodied in the brass chip test and the cavern map. The final renunciation (leaving the shop) is earned by the grandfather promise and the visible cost of abandoning thirty years’ safety. Minor slip: the “empirically intuitive” label is stated more than dramatized beyond the chip scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus steps through the doorway and the same cavern reconfigures around his new stance—“he was no longer someone who only sold maps.” Causal chain holds: creek rise → ants → cavern → chip → doorway choice, each beat tightening options. Cost is legible in the final image of the falling creek and the blank paper awaiting new legends.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dusty shop, rising creek, and luminous cavern are filtered through Marcus’s map-seller gaze; the brass chip functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy (dust, mineral air, crystalline light) mirrors his shift from stasis to possibility. One minor drift: the “impossible summer light” could be more grounded in POV physics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Marcus remain a spectator or become a traveler?—is signaled early and tightens once: the doorway forces a binary choice. Escalation is situational: rising water, marching ants, and the chip’s warmth increase coherent pressure without external antagonist. The cost (abandoning lifelong identity) is visible in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: maps as metaphor for unlived life versus maps as living process. The matrix chip reweights from printing tool to reading lens, culminating in the non-literal answer that “the only map that mattered” is the one still being drawn. No moralizing; the final image invites reflection without dictation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is textured, antique, and map-literate—“routes to places that no longer existed”—with rhythmic control that accelerates during the creek rise. Compression is purposeful: the grandfather’s deathbed line is taught early and paid off at closure. No POV leakage; perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and thematic work. Figurative language is selective—“promise, decades old, suddenly sharp as broken glass”—and never muddles causality. One minor loop: “the ants traced… Marcus followed” repeats the prior beat’s structure but serves cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of antique cartography, childhood promise, and magical realism feels inevitable in hindsight. The matrix chip and ant trail transform familiar quest tropes into a quiet, interior journey. Risk-taking (topology of choices, doorway reconfiguration) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
