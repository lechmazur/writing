<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is textured and embodied—his fingers tracing glass, the stone in his pocket, the way ripples “breathe.” The contradiction between his craft’s precision and his newfound metaphysical seeing is dramatized in the act of throwing the stone. The final resolve to document and teach is earned by the prior beat of watching interference patterns, carrying visible cost: the atrium’s impending loss. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus crystallizes a stance—preservation through teaching—while the bulldozers remain an unstoppable future cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ripple, light shard, and mist layer thickens meaning until the final image reweights “surfaces as birthplaces.” Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift. The persistent constraint (demolition letter) shapes the final urgency to document.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prism atrium itself—glass angles, condensation beads, central pool—functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice: Marcus can only experiment within its geometry. Pearl Bay’s pre-dawn mist and noctilucent afterglow are filtered through glazier perception, not tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; the stone’s arc and ripple intersections track without confusion. The setting evolves as light shifts, directly powering the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: salvage meaning from the mundane before modernization erases it. Escalation is accretive: each ripple pattern intensifies the cost of impending loss. The tightening beat—“he would document this”—is a micro-choice that forecloses passive acceptance. Cost is felt in the line “Before the bulldozers came,” charging the final image under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: boundaries are generative interfaces, not barriers. The prism atrium’s destruction becomes the conceptual repricing that illuminates the value it once framed. No moralizing; the final smile and “clear view through” resonate without dictating interpretation. Subtext lives in gesture—the second stone thrown after the decision—rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is glazier-specific: light “shattered into spectra,” droplets “tiny lenses,” ripples “like breathing.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses at dawn crest, longer reflective cadences in mist. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Perceptual signature is consistent; no POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “concentric rings spread outward, perfect circles disturbed by the atrium’s geometry.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is pattern-taught early (light splitting, surfaces reflecting) and paid off in the final rainbowed water. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of glazier craft, wave interference physics, and metaphysical reckoning feels inevitable yet fresh. The noctilucent ice-crystal metaphor reframed as “endings that illuminate beginnings” is a non-obvious turn. Risk in quiet lyric closure is rewarded: no confrontation, only ripples and light, yet stakes remain legible. Specificity of occupation and locale prevents template drift.</comment>
