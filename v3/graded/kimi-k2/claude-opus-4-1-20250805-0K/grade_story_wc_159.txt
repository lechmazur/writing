<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interior contradiction—methodical caretaker vs. granddaughter aching for a lost name—plays out in embodied micro-choices (trailing fingers, measured steps, urgent whisper). The final act of capture is earned by lifelong motive and costs the cracked chime itself, sealing a path with felt loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (orchid, chime, lullaby) intensifies until the final reconfiguration—Solmieth’s name preserved—reweights the premise from monument to living bridge. Closure lands with visible cost as the bamboo splits and silence falls.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The opal library’s crystalline walls and cloud-suspended geography constrain every motion; the cracked bamboo chime becomes micro-setting that literally fractures to enable the climax. Specificity of glass orchids, bamboo resonance, and dawn light charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the grandmother’s name—tightens when the chime’s new undertone offers a single fragile chance. Escalation is driven by Mira’s systematic urgency; the cost is the chime’s destruction and her own eventual erasure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of remembrance vs. oblivion emerges through the orchid constellation and the cracked chime’s sacrifice; no explicit moralizing. The final image—Solmieth glowing among lost names—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: preservation is rebellion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled rhythm that quickens under pressure (“breathed the name into its glassy heart”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices through caretaker’s sensory hierarchy—textures of extinct things, acoustic nuance, molecular memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and emotional information without redundancy. No loops or scaffold; figurative language (foxglove regret, crystalline walls) is selective and purposeful, never muddling causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of memory-libraries, glass orchids, and acoustic preservation feels inevitable yet fresh. The cracked chime’s accidental tuning device is a non-obvious mechanism that transforms a familiar elegy into active resistance against forgetting.</comment>
