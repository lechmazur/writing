<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei’s contradictory impulses—duty to family vs. moral awakening—are dramatized through the micro-choice of burning both forgeries; the cost (loss of anonymity, exposure of family crimes) is felt on the page. Interiority is embodied in the pulse of the sanctuary and the blood bead on the thorn. The final renunciation is earned by prior causal beats: every forged document she recalls justifies her confession. Only the grandmother’s off-stage voice keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: burning the forgeries and writing the confession forecloses the path of inherited treason. Causal chain holds: because she forged before, therefore she must confess now. The key’s delayed lock is taught early and paid off at the altar. Cost is legible in the ash settling “like snow” and her emergence into a world that will judge her.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary’s aurora-lit columns and dripping stalactites constrain the scene’s tempo and mood; the translucent ceiling literally filters the light that guides her final act. Micro-setting of the altar and oil lamp serve as the stage for the decisive burn. Environment is not just backdrop but moral witness. Only the off-stage prison cell keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free her brother or end the cycle—tightens when she realizes both forged documents are traps. One meaningful turn: the key’s revelation reweights the stakes from forgery to confession. Pressure grows under causal lens; no coincidence resolves anything. Cost is the surrender of her secret identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “treason against one’s own nature” emerges from the concrete act of burning lies and writing truth. Subtext lives in the rose thorn’s weight holding the confession—bloodline turned to paperweight. Final image of aurora fading into pearl twilight reconfigures the meaning of light/dark without moralizing. No thematic drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled rhythm under pressure (“stalactites dripped their patient rhythm”). POV remains tightly anchored to Mei’s sensory filter; no head-hop. Compression like “calibrated treason” teaches the pattern early and pays off. Occasional elevated diction (“aurora’s green dance”) is earned by the mythic frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers image and stakes (“ash that settled like snow on the marble floor”). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent—thorn, ink, light—without muddle. Only minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of calligraphy-as-weapon, aurora-lit sanctuary, and inherited treason feels fresh and inevitable. The rose thorn as both oath and paperweight transforms a familiar symbol. Risky choice to hinge climax on burning rather than forging pays off emotionally. No derivative echoes.</comment>
