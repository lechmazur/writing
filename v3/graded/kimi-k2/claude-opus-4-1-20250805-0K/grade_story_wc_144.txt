<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is embodied through tactile perception and micro-choices under time pressure; the contradiction between her blindness and hyper-acuity is dramatized in the repair beats. The final renunciation (“I just helped them find their way”) carries earned cost—she remains in the depot while the ship departs. Secondary pressure from Chen is minimal but functional. No diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (mist acoustics → fracture detection → patch → release) links by “because/therefore.” Closure is a Charged Poise: the drone’s diminishing hum reconfigures Maya’s stance with felt cost—she stays behind. Anchor and orientation are clear by line 5; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot is not backdrop; droplet acoustics literally enable the repair and shape the final image. Micro-setting (workbench, skylight prisms) constrains every tool reach. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ship’s safe departure—signaled early and tightened by the 20-minute countdown. One decisive turn: Maya’s successful patch forecloses her chance to leave, visible cost in the final stance. Pressure escalates causally; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of “broken things learning to work again” emerges from the drone repair and Maya’s self-repair; never stated, only embodied. Final image of the depot as “island of magnetic calm” reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity lingers: her gift is also her confinement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is tactile, rhythmic, and consistent with a blind artisan’s perceptual signature (“sound and vibration moved through water droplets”). No head-hopping; Chen’s dialogue is spare and functional. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer reflective cadence early, clipped precision during countdown.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>High information density: “water beaded and rolled away, creating distinct acoustic signatures” does triple duty—setting, process, character. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates naturally with the loudspeaker call. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blind technician using mist acoustics as diagnostic tool feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in making the repair purely tactile pays off. No derivative templates; the hummingbird drone is reweighted from broken tool to guide, then to departing sound.</comment>
