<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Magnus is textured through sensory choices—salt-cracked palm, pressing flower to temple—but the interior contradiction between craving connection and living in willed isolation is more stated than dramatized. The climactic renunciation of his lighthouse solitude, after the cascade of recovered memory, lands as Earned Stasis precisely because holding to the tower still costs him the son who returned only to depart again.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the return of the Edelweiss in the final beam crystallizes a before/after in which Magnus now guards his own memories instead of borrowed ones, payment exacted by the son’s disappearance into the same waters that swallowed earlier years. Causal chain is tight; each lighthouse sweep triggers the next missing splice, the coordinates etched on the dock translate to missing wedding time, culminating in the decisive recognition of stolen moments finally given back.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The opal dock’s “severed finger,” moonstone planks, and fog pressure ground every action; Edelweiss itself acts as micro-setting that changes state (wilt → pin → transparency) and thus choice. Environment literally constrains his movement to one linear walkway where return is impossible, and the lighthouse’s rotation becomes the temporal ruler for memory gaps, fulfilling the 9+ requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recovering lost identity against the tidal pull of isolation. Pressure ratchets because every new bloom of memory threatens the self-narrative Magnus has survived on; the deepening occurs when he realizes the gaps are evidence of theft rather than natural fade, forcing a choice between safety of forgetting or pain of owning his past. Cost is the immediate re-experienced rupture as the son vanishes again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited longing and parental abandonment is sculpted entirely through images—dried Alpine bloom at sea, rice transforming to sea-foam—avoiding any thematic statement. The final lens flare of the swimming figure (son? metaphor?) leaves an ambiguous afterimage that revalues Magnus’s solitary watch into a vigil of guilty love; no platitudes intrude.</comment>

<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Consistent third-limited, nautical register laced with tactile loneliness. Syntax mirrors the measured beam: long seaborne sentences alternating with tight clauses that mimic a pulse. Occasional purposeful fragments (“a mountain bloom exiled”) feel earned; voice modulation stays controlled as pressure rises.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm flexes naturally—investigations probe “like a dentist” without figurative overload. Occasional purple flourish (“opal dock… like a severed finger”) feels deliberate because it introduces the governing wound metaphor. Only minor loop: “filling gaps” repeated twice but in beats that intensify rather than stall.</comment>

<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The memory-transfer conceit collides elegantly with family estrangement, offering a fresh synthesis where the Edelweiss is not prop but forensic tool. Twist that gaps are the preserved memories, not the missing ones, reframes prior lyric detail with retrospective inevitability worth the risk.</comment>
