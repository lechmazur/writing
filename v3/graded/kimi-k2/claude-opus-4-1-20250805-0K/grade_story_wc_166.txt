<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—yearning for connection yet embracing exile—are embodied in her dance; the final renunciation of safety is earned by her prior isolation and the visible cost of imminent capture. Interiority is concrete, e.g., “loneliness threatened to unmoor her completely.” No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dance phrase adds luminous density until the garden itself becomes a living text. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mira’s body turned into “a living document of defiance”—with the felt cost of tomorrow’s arrest. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The twilight garden’s wisteria and marble statues are filtered through Mira’s perception and constrain her ritual space; the moonstone dust becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and selective, e.g., “dew-slicked stones,” “wisteria hung heavy with blooms.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—create a defiant cosmic verse—tightens as each gesture seeds future rebellion. The final dance forecloses stealth; the cost is explicit: “By dawn, the authorities would detect the energy signature and come for her.” Escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory as resistance emerges through concrete particulars: moonstone dust, forbidden dance, garden imprint. Final image reweights the premise—exile becomes expansion—without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture; no thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice: “obsidian grace,” “lunar rhythm,” “cosmic verse on mortal skin.” POV remains tightly anchored to Mira; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early (“three years ago”) and paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Opening and closing lines are charged: “The tide dancer moved…” / “tonight she was eternal.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-ban dystopia with embodied astrophysics; the dance-as-cosmic-script feels inevitable. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes; specific details (moonstone dust, wisteria constellations) are irreplaceable.</comment>
