<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marina’s shift from detached investigator to willing collaborator is credible, but her interiority is mostly summarized; the moment she “understood suddenly” is too neat. Claudia’s motivation is sketched rather than dramatized, yet the father-daughter regret crucible still lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Marina chooses preservation over exposure, foreclosing her myth-busting path with felt cost. Causality is causal-accumulative hybrid; each resonance beat tightens the emotional stakes until the final bow stroke crystallizes the shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The observatory’s decay—salt-stained dome, rusted stairs—mirrors unfinished grief and literally houses the cello that constrains the climax. Micro-setting (the shell pressed to the cello’s heart) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: whether to debunk or honor Tern’s legacy. Pressure tightens once: Marina’s agency moves from testing the myth to sustaining it. Cost is conceptual—loss of professional identity—made legible in her nod to Claudia.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through concrete objects: regret as unfinished acoustic space. Subtext in the cello’s unheard harmonics avoids moralizing; the ending image of waves “keeping time” reweights the premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; “dust motes danced through gaps” and “pale as driftwood” show perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but Claudia’s “cheerfully gloomy” tone is distinct. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; sentences advance both atmosphere and information. Minor loop: “rustled in the wind like dying moths” followed by “frozen, pointing at nothing” is near-redundant but doesn’t stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The “ephemeral compass” trope is refreshed by treating regret as navigational data; unfinished cello as antenna for unsaid words is specific and non-obvious. Slight risk in lyric abstraction is justified by earned closure.</comment>
