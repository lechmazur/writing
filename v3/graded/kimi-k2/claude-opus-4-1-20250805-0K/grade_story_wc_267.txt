<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s numb hands, pocketed bolt, and nightly vigil at the staircase mark a lived-in interiority; the final micro-choice—handing Elena the bolt—earns the closure cost. Elena's whispered line is the only overt self-diagnosis, but it lands as earned wisdom rather than therapy-speak. The seven-year frostbite and nerve regeneration anchor a credible physical limit that compounds his decision to stay. Flaws (guilt, compulsion) complicate rather than decorate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the single new note at eight o’clock reweights the entire premise of “unpardonable silence” into deliberate, chosen sound. Causal chain holds: bolt → staircase discoloration → Elena’s return → new composition. Orientation is anchored by the second paragraph; no drift. The cost—seven winters of silence and frostbite—is legible in the final image of “cobalt stones warming.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt walls, perpetual ice glaze, and worn seventh step function as micro-setting that constrains every move; the bolt and staircase discoloration act as object-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: numb fingers, phantom tingles, cold metal. Spatial choreography is clean; the seventh step’s location is tracked across beats. Weather is not backdrop but causal pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“some silences are unpardonable”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Elena’s whisper reframes silence as a deliberate gift. One meaningful deepening: the bolt’s return converts guilt into collaborative creation. Cost is visible in Marcus’s frostbitten nerves and Elena’s scarred throat. Agency remains with Marcus; coincidence (Elena’s arrival) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the tension between demanded performance and authentic sound; the final note offers a non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in the bolt, the discoloration, and the warming stones. No thematic echo in dialogue; Elena’s line is character-bound. The piece invites reflection on when silence is gift versus theft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; perceptual signature is tactile and frost-numbed. Syntax tightens under pressure—“his regenerating nerves singing with something that felt almost like music.” No dialogue until the whispered reunion; that line carries subtext and advances plot. Voice remains consistent, with no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “seraphically mundane,” “phantom sensations,” “cobalt stones warming.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Rhythm modulates naturally; the final paragraph slows into a resonant cadence. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of Gothic hotel, acoustic curse, and frostbitten atonement feels fresh; the bolt-as-talisman and staircase-as-confessional are specific to this world. Transformation test: the emotional arc collapses if transplanted. The risk of a quiet, lyric ending pays off with a charged final image. No derivative echoes detected.</comment>
