<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus has clear motives tied to inherited responsibility, but Teresa’s guilt remains reportage rather than embodied stakes. Interiority is vivid yet tilts toward exposition during peak beats. The choice to carry the evidence to reporters arrives late and lightly, so the final act feels foregone rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghosts fade while Marcus inherits their silence; cost is the weight he now carries alone. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern piles up across buildings like residue until the final image reweights “broken to fixed.” One late causal leap: the spring warms inexplicably, cueing grandmother’s past sabotage without setup.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The abandoned circus office feels palpably disused: dust thickness mapping, the flickering fluorescent signaling time, the hidden ceiling cache granting physical access to evidence. Setting constrains the choice of where to pry the floorboard and charges the final “honest darkness.” A minor spatial hiccup—Marcus somehow retrieves journals from a ceiling too high while balancing on a counter.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Pressure deepens as each journal widens the conspiracy, forcing Marcus to internalize the cost of uncovering systemic rot. Escalation is textural—evidence accumulates under the Accumulative lens—yet the final beat pivots from tension to elegiac release rather than presenting a trade-off that narrows his next tactical options.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges as the porous boundary between working and broken, innocence and complicity. Subtext refrains from preaching; instead, silence itself becomes the moral weight. Final image—“the cracks in the facade showed clearly”—reprises the motif without moralizing, leaving the reader with cost rather than instruction.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled and sensorily concrete—“dust motes spiral through the last shaft of evening light.” Occasional elevated phrasing “conceptual repricing” momentarily drifts above Marcus’s vernacular but is quickly anchored by his grounded action. Perceptual signature—attention to cables ‘singing’ and dust patterns—persists throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is limber, rhythmic, dense with purposeful metaphor—“building exhaled around him.” One near-loop in the second paragraph re-states the “counting” twice without adding pressure, but elsewhere every sentence carries dual sensory/informational freight. No artifacts muddy closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The ghost-mechanic trope is familiar, yet the specificity of circus corruption journals and the grandmother’s sabotaged timers gives the piece bespoke gravity. The final re-weighting of “every broken thing could still be fixed” feels inevitable rather than clever.</comment>
