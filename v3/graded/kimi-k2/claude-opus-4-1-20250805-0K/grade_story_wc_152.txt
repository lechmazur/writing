<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera’s layered performance—drooling crone vs. razor-sharp spy—creates palpable interior contradiction; every stitch is a micro-choice that encodes risk. The final smile carries earned cost: her cover must hold forever, resistance or no. Only the “humming as mnemonic” device edges toward convenient super-power, keeping her just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last secret threaded, the coup clock still ticking, her stance crystallized with undeniable risk. Causal chain is tight—each overheard word → encoded star → chart dispatched—yet lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density and cadence shift reweight the stake rather than a single causal turn. Eternal-flame constraint persists, shaping tactics to the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt dome, eternal candle, and midnight velvet are not backdrop but tools: the dome’s acoustics hide whispers, the candle supplies the luminous thread that makes hidden routes legible. Autumn’s dying light mirrors the empire’s decay, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies, charts, flame tracked cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—smuggle intelligence before the coup—tightens once when Crane announces the observatory lockdown, forcing Vera to finish tonight. Pressure is coherent and intensifies under Accumulative lens: each embroidered star adds density and risk. Cost is visible in her pricked finger and the irreversible commitment of the final chart.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of hidden wisdom emerges organically from the act of stitching; no moral is stated. The eternal flame’s “patient burning” becomes a resonant non-literal answer to how quiet resistance endures. Final image of wind rattling the dome reweights earlier silence as loaded vigilance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise: “cobalt dome… bruise against the sky” sets tone immediately. Compression and patterned elision (“twin moons, silver spoons”) are taught early and paid off as code. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains Vera’s selective, sly noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers code, texture, or stakes. Metaphors are controlled—“eternal flame’s ancient, patient burning” lands without clutter. Zero loops or scaffold; minor elevation in register (“adjacent possibilities”) is voice-motivated and brief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Spy-thriller tropes are inverted through embroidery-as-cryptography and the “harmless fool” disguise, rendered with tactile specificity. Synthesis feels inevitable: celestial navigation and covert intel collapse into the same cloth. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final charged image.</comment>
