<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Miran’s contradictory impulse—flee vs. metabolize regret—is embodied in the tremor before she presses palms to the pool; the cost (bearing centuries of grief) is felt, but interiority occasionally drifts into summary (“she understood now”) rather than live contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the clear-water pool and starlight without sorrow crystallize the shift. Causal chain holds—rain awakens memory, memory compels absorption, absorption transforms the fortress—though a brief reflective block edges the BRR limit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Desert fortress, tidal pools, and coral pavilion are vivid and selective; the spiral pool pattern later constrains Miran’s choice by matching her grandmother’s cookbook, directly charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—will she absorb the fortress’s remorse?—tightens once when she plants her palms; the felt cost (emotional sandstorm scouring her) is legible, but escalation is more accumulative intensification than causal narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of metabolized regret emerges through concrete action; the final image of clear pools reflecting “stars without sorrow” offers non-literal resonance. One near-label phrase (“she had become the fortress’s salvation”) is brief enough to avoid sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, sensory, and consistent; perceptual signature shows in culinary metaphors (“taste of exile,” “digest the centuries”). Compression and lyric patterning are taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is mostly clean and propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“sandstorm scouring her from inside”) flirt with overwriting but do not obscure causality. One paraphrase loop (“memories weren’t just flavors. They were emotionally contagious”) could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Memory-tasting chef absorbing geological regret is a fresh synthesis; the coral pavilion as frozen scream and cookbook spiral as map feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric density pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
