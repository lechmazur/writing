<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied (hand on mica, feeling for warmth) and her micro-choices (“tried everything else… began with a whisper”) drive causality; the contradiction between solo duty and communal remedy is dramatized, though her flaws remain fairly mild. The renunciation of despair in favor of iterative collective singing is earned and carries visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern of memory gathering, song layers, and rising light tighten across beats until the final image reweights the world rule (“taught it a different way to live”). Closure is a Charged Poise that crystallizes the necessity of tomorrow’s resinging with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is specific and sensuous (iron framework, silver bark dulled to pewter); the greenhouse itself becomes a resonant instrument that constrains action (trees hum, frames ring). Micro-setting (mica window) charges the final image directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—“how to resurrect a dawnless realm”—is early and urgent; each remembered song deepens jeopardy, tightening the cost of potential failure until the culminating communal reimagining that trades cosmic obligation for communal responsibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The theme that light can only be communally invented emerges from granular sensory specifics: withered fruit as maracas, bread rising, dew on spider silk. Final image reframes sunrise itself without slogan, embodying the cost of perpetual vigilance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet urgent, with rhythmic long-punctuated cadence that mirrors song gathering. POV is strictly anchored to Elara’s sensibility; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but clear; figurative runs (“husks that rattled like maracas”) advance mood without muddying sense. One or two minor filter phrases (“it felt”) slip in but never clutter closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of orchard-as-communal-instrument and dawn-as-choir turns familiar post-apocalyptic trope into participatory cosmology. “We would need to sing again tomorrow” reframes salvation as iterative labor rather than miracle.</comment>
