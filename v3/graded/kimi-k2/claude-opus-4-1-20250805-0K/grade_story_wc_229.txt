<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory push/pull between grief and forgiveness plays in immediate stakes, but the “manifest memory into molecules” premise skirts too easily toward therapy-label clarity (“guilt...love a chain”) rather than embodied contradiction. The final reunion lands as Earned Stasis with touching cost, yet her interior drifts in places (“her voice breaking with screaming tenderness”) undercuts moment pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural; closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (“Their intentions had merged...born from screaming tenderness...two shadows danced in its light”). Transitions are smooth, but the jasmine-as-vehicle rule is introduced and accepted instantaneously without taught pattern, creating a soft world-rule leap just before closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lighthouse as micro-setting constrains the reunion height, while the peeling cobalt paint and sea-washed stone body the grief. Jasmine scent is handled kinesthetically, pressing against spatial limits. Aurora beam physically charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mara’s will to summon versus release Thomas—tightens once via the jasmine-fog beat, forcing her to trade obsession for mercy. Cost arrives on-page: the final embrace occurs at the price of Thomas’s partial incorporeality (“perhaps never again fully human”).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as molecular distillation emerges implicitly through scent and light, never sloganized. Subtext coils in the line “Listen...vibrations of intent so pure”; final tableau leaves ambiguity about what “saved” truly means.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-limited stays tight; internal diction modulates to lyric intensity without overwriting. The focalizer’s noticing (“The cork rolled across her palm, warm as a living thing”) marks specific perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Most lines propel, though occasional stacked modifiers (“screaming tenderness, that particular ache...”) verge on overwriting. No significant loops; metaphors remain coherent. Rhythm slows slightly in reflective blocks but recovers before closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Lighthouse-ghost romance trope is freshly reweighted by intent-as-chemistry; specificity of scent-as-conduit differentiates from spectral cliché. Fresh risk taken with near-SF conceit, but novelty hinges entire arc on a rule left abstract.</comment>
