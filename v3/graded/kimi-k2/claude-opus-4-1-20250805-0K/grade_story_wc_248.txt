<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s contradictory impulses—arsonist vs. keeper—are embodied in tactile beats (“volcanic tenderness”); the final renunciation of her terrorist identity is earned by the prior causal chain of genetic memory and ancestral promise. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. The only cap is the absence of a second on-page character, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s shift from destroyer to keeper crystallizes in the final image of imperishable memory. Causal lens holds—each burned library is a because/therefore step toward the archive. Cost is legible in her scarred hands and the world’s condemnation. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The limestone corridors and tapestry fragments are not backdrop; the archive’s air “tasted of copper” constrains her breathing and signals danger, while the tapestry’s weave literally encodes the molecular formula that will alter the future. Micro-setting—the fragment in her fingers—charges the final image. Selective sensory detail mirrors her narrowed, urgent focus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rescue the imperishable memory technique—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when she realizes the tapestry encodes the formula. One decisive deepening: the recognition that her “compulsion to burn lies” was genetically steered. Cost is felt in the phrase “the world above thought her a terrorist.” Agency drives every beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: memory as living fiber, truth as something that survives fire. No moralizing; the final image of “destruction and creation unified in her scarred hands” reweights the premise without statement. Subtext operates in the vandalized portraits that were actually improvements. Complexity is honored—she remains morally ambiguous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—analytical yet lyric, with volcanic metaphors sustained throughout. Perceptual signature is sharp: she notices “anachronistic paper fibers” and “impossible ink compositions.” No head-hopping; POV remains locked. Compression is purposeful; elisions (three years off-grid) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances knowledge or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled—“lava cooling into new earth” is earned by context. Rhythm modulates with pressure; short clauses under stress (“Thread by thread…”) accelerate the beat. Minor elevated diction (“imperishable”) is justified by stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—genetic arsonist turned keeper of unburnable truth—is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (lost civilization, secret archive) are transformed through textile science and epigenetic memory. Specificity anchors universals: the molecular formula encoded in weave. Risk-taking (lyric density + causal rigor) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
