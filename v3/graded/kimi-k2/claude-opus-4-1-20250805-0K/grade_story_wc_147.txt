<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s contradictory impulses—scientist vs. seeker—are embodied in micro-choices (sparing the vial, activating the recorder) and culminate in the irreversible surrender; the cost is legible. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. Only the absence of a second on-page character keeps it from 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s final inhalation crystallizes the choice to become memory itself, with the empty vial drifting upward as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of memory threads tightens until the last beat reweights all prior stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The temple’s impossible geometry and bioluminescent water are not backdrop; they actively constrain navigation and finally house the machine that redefines Maya’s options. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through her dwindling oxygen.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve self vs. join eternity—tightens with each breath; the final renunciation forecloses escape. Agency drives every escalation; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the concrete: the price of bottling transcendence is to become bottled oneself. The ending’s image of the drifting vial reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric compression, scientific precision, and submerged awe braided seamlessly. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and dense; figurative language is purposeful, never purple. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Minor cadence repetition in “temple’s” phrases is negligible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of salvage expedition, memory-preservation temple, and voluntary dissolution feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Risky spatial paradoxes and lyric structure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
