<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is embodied and specific—her tactile memory of polishing, the weight of the glass, the “delighted laugh” that becomes wind-chimes. The shift from solitary search to communal teacher is earned through her grandfather’s cryptic legacy and the visible cost of sharing the secret. Minor slip: the phrase “earthbound star watcher” is slightly label-like, but the rest of the arc is grounded in micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marina’s stance crystallizes into communal stewardship, the grotto’s light now a shared resource. Causal chain holds—grandfather’s clue → grotto test → beacon demonstration → teaching. Cost is legible: the once-private sea glass becomes public trust. Lens is Causal with Accumulative texture; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto’s serpentine curves and misty acoustics actively shape the beacon’s reach; the sea glass itself becomes micro-setting that constrains how light is cast. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—salt-slick steps, pearl-soft illumination. One minor drift: “zephyr bloom” feels slightly detached from Marina’s lexicon, but the rest is integrated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding a new way to guide ships—tightens when the grotto’s light proves viable and Marina chooses to teach rather than hoard. Escalation is one meaningful turn: private discovery → public responsibility. Cost is the loss of exclusivity. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of light as shared, patient guidance emerges organically from the grotto’s mist, the polishing ritual, and the final communal beacon. No overt moralizing; the ending image of “tender persistence of starlight reflected in morning mist” reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in Tomás’s single word “How?” carries awe and surrender.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Marina’s perceptual signature—astronomer’s lantern, gem-polisher’s circular motions. Syntax modulates with emotional rise: longer cadence in reflection, clipped ascent at climax. No head-hopping; free-indirect style stays clean. “Zephyr bloom” is the only register hiccup.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive: “mist curled through limestone passages like liquid starlight” does double duty for setting and metaphor. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or choice. Rhythm breathes with scene—short beats during discovery, longer exhalations during teaching. One mixed metaphor (“breathing” grotto) but clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse replaced by bioluminescent sea-glass beacon taught through ancestral gem-polishing lore. The grotto-as-lens is a non-obvious twist on navigation myth. Specificity of polishing motion and phosphorescence lore grounds the magic. Risky lyricism pays off without obscuring causality.</comment>
