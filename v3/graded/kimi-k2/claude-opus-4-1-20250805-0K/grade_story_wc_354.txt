<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Viktor’s contradictory impulses—yearning for return vs. choosing exile—are embodied in the thumb on the stone and the final gift of it to Mira; the cost of renunciation is felt. Interiority is concrete (thumb in dent, pieces sliding by magnetism). Mira serves as crucible, her question forcing his crystallized stance. Minor slip: “beauty lives in difficulty” drifts toward aphorism.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis: Viktor refuses the Academy and passes the stone to Mira, foreclosing return with visible cost (“Tomorrow I stay”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each magnetic detail, aurora pulse, and chess position layers density until the final reconfiguration. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the stone’s transfer and the covenant’s inversion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Magnetic nexus is not backdrop; its field literally moves pieces and shapes Viktor’s pedagogy. Twilight’s rust-violet palette mirrors internal rust and bruised hope. Basalt stone and magnetite-quartz board function as micro-settings that constrain choices. Final aurora charges the closing image with planetary resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—return or remain—tightens when Mira asks, “Will you leave us?” The covenant’s expiry creates one decisive pressure point; Viktor’s renunciation narrows options to a single path with felt cost. No reversals, but the deepening is sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: exile as gift, beauty in difficulty, silence translated to action. Final image (aurora over shared board) reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in the stone’s dent and Mira’s magnetite squares carries generational wisdom. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, modulating from reflective melancholy to quiet resolve. Perceptual signature filters every detail through Viktor’s chess-trained pattern-seeking mind. Dialogue between Viktor and Mira is spare, subtextual. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid: “iron-rich cliffs in shades of rust and violet” does double sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or character. Metaphors (magnetic confusion mirroring exile) are coherent and purposeful. Rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: chess pedagogy fused with geomagnetic lore and auroral physics. Covenant inversion—exile as gift—reframes trope. Stone and magnetite board are specific inventions; removing them breaks logic. Risky lyric compression pays off in charged closure.</comment>
