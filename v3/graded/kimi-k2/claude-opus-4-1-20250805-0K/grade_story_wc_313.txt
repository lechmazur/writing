<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s contradictory impulses—methodical duty vs. buried guilt—surface in the pharmacy beat; the micro-choice to pocket the bottle and photograph Elena’s image forecloses the official lie with visible cost. Interiority is embodied (trembling hands, mirrored hush) rather than labeled. The final stance crystallizes: he will testify, not merely record. One slip: the grandmother backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, keeping it just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus’s decision to “write Elena’s name beneath each one” reweights the town’s future and his own role. Causal chain holds—bottle triggers memory, memory triggers walking tour, tour yields evidence, evidence compels witness. Cost is legible in the mirrored hush and the talismanic bottle. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Reservoir, pharmacy, ridgeway, and moonlit bottle all constrain movement and meaning; the sapphire label literally charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—dripping rooftops, warped door, black mirrors—filtered through Marcus’s professional gaze. Spatial choreography is clean; descent and ascent bracket the revelation. One minor drift: “twilight” and “midnight” blur exact time, but the effect serves the mirrored hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. sanctioned forgetting—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Marcus chooses witness over documentation. The photograph of Elena forces a trade-off: official safety vs. moral reckoning. Pressure escalates causally; no coincidence resolves. Cost is felt in the pocketed talisman and the wind chime’s reprise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of submerged memory and collective guilt emerges through objects (bottle, photograph) and actions (photographing, naming). No moralizing; the final image of the wind chime reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in the “precisely humane lie” reverberates. Complexity is honored: the town’s survival required erasure, yet erasure now demands redress.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is restrained, observational, with a levee warden’s lexicon—“service path,” “waterlogged street sign.” Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences contract into terse notations (“Click.”). No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Marcus. One elevated phrase—“ancient teeth”—edges outside his register but is earned by the twilight mood.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense: “rooftops emerged like ancient teeth” and “mirrored hush” do double duty. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. One mixed metaphor—“black mirrors, reflecting nothing but silence”—is momentary but doesn’t cloud closure. High information density with clear propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The drowned-town premise is familiar, yet the levee-warden POV and photograph trail give it fresh torque. Elena’s erased survival subverts the disaster-template. Specificity—Torrington’s Tonic, penny candy—grounds the myth. Risk: quiet witness instead of dramatic rescue, paid off in the final image.</comment>
