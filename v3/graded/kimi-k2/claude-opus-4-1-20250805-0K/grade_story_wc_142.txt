<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s interior contradiction—mainland education vs raft loyalty—drives every micro-choice; the stone chip embodies the cost when she presses it until it cuts. Her decision to “become something they can’t buy” is earned by prior beats of translation and negotiation. The final placement of the chip in the new cornerstone shows renunciation with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the community reorganizes into an unbreakable culture, foreclosing the path of direct resistance. The graffiti code taught early (“DEEP POCKETS DIVING SOON”) pays off in the legal murals that shield the carnival. Causal lens holds: because Maya translates warnings → therefore they incorporate → therefore lights stay free.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The raft city is never backdrop; bobbing platforms, wave-powered lights, and oil-drum fires constrain tactics and supply the final image of protected neon. Sensory hierarchy—black water reflections, rough stone edge cutting skin—mirrors internal stakes. The perpetual carnival functions as micro-setting that alters every choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival of the last free-floating community—is signaled in grafﬁti and tightened when “SHARKS WEARING SUITS” photograph the chaos. One decisive turn: incorporation as historical society forecloses violent resistance and carries the cost of legal exposure. Pressure escalates under causal lens until the final image reweights options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of cultural absorption vs commodification emerges through encoded murals and Maya’s translation labor; no explicit moralizing. The final graffiti “STILL FLOATING, STILL FREE” offers resonant non-literal answer that reweights earlier warnings. Complexity preserved: survival requires partial capitulation to the very system they resist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Maya notices selective details—fortune-teller booths, forged permits, stone’s rough edge—through a lens of cultural translation. Rhythm modulates with urgency; short declaratives during planning, longer lyrical cadences at closure. No head-hopping; POV stays anchored in Maya’s embodied cognition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; “spiral of blue dolphins swimming through golden text” does double descriptive and plot work. Occasional elevated diction (“intangible cultural heritage”) fits Maya’s mainland register without drifting. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances stakes or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Floating carnival as last free community before privatization is fresh synthesis; graffiti-as-legal-shield transforms familiar trope of street art into survival code. Specific lived detail—recycled bottle platforms, wave generators—grounds the premise. Risky structural choice to hinge climax on bureaucratic incorporation pays off with felt cost.</comment>
