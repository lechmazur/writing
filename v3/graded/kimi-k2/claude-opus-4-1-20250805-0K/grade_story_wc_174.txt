<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus is consistently framed but his serenity remains static; no contradiction complicates his next puppet show. The stick’s history is emotionally potent yet never weighs on a mid-scene choice; no felt cost or revaluing occurs inside the scene. Interiority drifts at times toward authorial summary, e.g., “He’d learned long ago…”. Still, the character’s vocation and ethical drive remain vivid and character-particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: Marcus commits to the backward puppet show, foreclosing reconciliation and accepting the ethical cost. The causality tilts Accumulative/Textural—density of theme and image steadily gathers—but no decisive incident inside this 800-word frame alters his path; the earlier argument is off-page. Arc anchors hold steady, so the cap yardstick is met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The radar dome’s acoustic shell becomes a physical workspace; its curved geometry reshapes firelight, literally casting the shadows Marcus will use. Sensory selection is vivid, character-filtered, and economical. By the end the dome’s broken panels frame meteors, supplying the final charged image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative situates an aftermath—not a living argument—so stakes stay reflective rather than tension-bearing. Pressure accumulates via theme density rather than option narrowing; no on-page obstacle or reversal forces a trade-off. Cost is implied in Marcus’s solitude and the upcoming reputational risk, but it is legible more as stance than escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—ethical storytelling—emerges through specific craft practice, not speech-making. The backward narrative device literalizes the moral question, showing rather than declaring ambiguity. The final reflection on “different beginning” hands the reader a resonant, non-moralizing re-weighting of all prior images.</comment>

<comment>Voice is urbane yet sensuous, full of honed metaphors (“meteor hush,” “cathedral echo”) that anchor to POV perception. Rhythms sway between lyrical suspension and crisp reportage. Compressive grammar and purposeful fragments are taught by line two and never rupture comprehension.</comment>

<comment>Prose is densely loaded without self-strangling: single sentences deliver atmospheric detail, character interiority, and forward motion. No loops, no mixed metaphors, 0.0% filler. Metaphors align with physical logic and emotional moment; proofreading flawless.</comment>

<comment>Even familiar bones (lonely artist, collaborators’ quarrel) are freshly articulated via calligraphy-puppetry synthesis and time-reversed form. The risky backward narrative feels inevitable in hindsight, not gimmick. Specific cultural objects (story stick, ink wash) tether concept to lived materiality.</comment>
