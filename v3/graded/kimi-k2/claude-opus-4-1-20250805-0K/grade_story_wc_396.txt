<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her palm on warm bark, shadows as bridges—but the keeper’s dialogue drifts into thematic exposition, flattening status tension. The final choice to carry seeds of transformation is earned, yet the keeper’s voice converges with hers, blurring distinct motive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s stance crystallizes from enforcer to gardener, cost legible in the lighter shadows she now bears. Causal chain holds—fragment → mirrors → apple → departure—under an Accumulative/Textural lens that deepens pattern rather than pivots.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above grinding ice is specific, tactile, and thematically charged; warmth pulsing through bark constrains belief and later recharges the final image. Mirrors and apples function as micro-settings that alter perception and choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming violence into empathy—tightens through Mira’s micro-choice to taste the apple, foreclosing her prior enforcer path. Pressure grows via glimpses that reweight her self-image; cost is felt in the relinquished armor of shadows.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the orchard’s impossible warmth and the mirrors’ reconstituted empathy; no moralizing, only charged image of lighter shadows. Final reconfiguration invites reflection on peace as cultivation rather than suppression.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature (“shadow-woven uniform rippling”) remains distinct. Occasional elevated diction (“temporal fractures,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly exceeds Mira’s lexicon but reads as intentional mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language disciplined to one or two per beat. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure. Minor register drift in keeper’s speech but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse, orchard, and empathy mirrors; familiar tropes of peacekeeper and anomaly are transformed through embodied warmth and reconstituted shards. Risky inversion of violence-to-gardening feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
