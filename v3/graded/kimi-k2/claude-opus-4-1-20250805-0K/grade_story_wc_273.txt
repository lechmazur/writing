<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—"serene anger" and "consciously wild methodology" are embodied in the ink ritual and tent angles—but the final shift from anger to understanding is asserted more than dramatized; no micro-choice on the page seals the renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each ink-fractal beat layers density until the final crystallization that consciousness and time are co-emergent. Closure is a Charged Poise—she “begins to disappear into her work”—with conceptual cost legible, though the cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Wind-carved encampment, obsidian pool, and drone form a tactile micro-setting that constrains her movements and frames the eclipse; the wind patterns mirroring ink fractals charge the final image. Spatial anchors are clear by 120 words.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why crisis distorts time—is signaled early and deepens as the ink’s reverse cascade reveals consciousness as the driver. One tightening: the drone’s struggle to record the final patterns shows the cost of knowledge, narrowing options toward acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: consciousness and time are entangled, revealed only under existential pressure. The disappearing ink reweights from anomaly to ontological truth without moralizing; resonance lingers in the final image of her vanishing into the mystery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—scientific precision braided with lyrical mysticism (“ghost of science itself”). Perceptual signature is consistent; no POV drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final dissolve.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. Minor scaffold—“time stretched like taffy” is familiar—but no loops or register drift. Final cadence accelerates cleanly into the vanishing image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Temporal anomaly hunting via disappearing ink is fresh; the synthesis of quantum consciousness and eclipse ritual feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression succeeds without obscuring stakes.</comment>
