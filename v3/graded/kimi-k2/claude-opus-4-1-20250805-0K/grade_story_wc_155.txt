<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority shines: her hunger for beauty in decay and the bittersweet ache that blooms when she re-creates collective joy are fully embodied. However, her agency remains largely passive reception of the knowledge network; no internal contradiction or flaw complicates the final choice—she simply accepts the gift. Flaw & cost not dramatized, therefore the arc flirts with wish fulfilment. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is an Earned Stasis: Marina accepts the transience of her luminous mural, feeling the orchard’s remembered joy settle on her like fog that refuses to lift—cost of perpetually returning to rebuild. Causal chain tracks cleanly: fresco fragment > network > display > renunciation of permanence. Lens holds Accumulative/Textural, but the decisive “therefore” beat is slightly thin on tangible price beyond wistfulness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Studio-cave, fog-dampened stone, and the luminous apple-blossom walls act as micro-setting. Orchard district’s ruin haunts every beat, and the fresco fragment literally warms the palm—an object that constrains Marina’s light-migration. Specificity is rich sensory and integral to the ending’s gleam. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: resurrect communal joy in the face of inexorable fog. Escalation is single but meaningful—the mural burns brighter as she accepts transience. Cost is the endless recurrence of the act; agency is Marina’s renunciation of permanence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme is the reclamation of joy itself as defiance against erasure, never announced but threaded through light-work and shared memory. Final lingering image of drifting back “where apple blossoms never stopped blooming” serves as resonant reconfiguration. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity stays in the fog that always returns.</comment>

<comment>Lyrism is controlled and apposite—silk, honey, nonexistent breezes—but leans poetic at times, brushing register drift. POV stays anchored inside Marina, never leaky. Cadence breathes with scene tension; no head-hopping. Distinct micro-sensual voice that falters only in isolated lyrical spikes.</comment>

<comment>Sentence-level craft is tight, sensory-rich, and propulsive. Few mild excesses—e.g., “pigments barely visible through centuries of fog-dampened decay”—could shed a modifier. Patterned “fold of daydream” returns elegantly, no loops. Reads well aloud; no filter clusters or mixed metaphors.</question>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The “community light-painting” conceit fuses memory retrieval, collective art practice, and anti-entropy elegy in a compact synthesis that feels organic rather than cleverness for its own sake. Orchard joy reframed through photon resurrection is a fresh inflection on post-apocalyptic elegy. Stakes are high yet intimate—individual and communal memory entwined without spectacle inflation.</question>
