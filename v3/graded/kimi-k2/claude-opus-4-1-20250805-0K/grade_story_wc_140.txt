<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mari’s contradictory impulses—yearning for erasure yet chronicling others—surface in the pencil annotations and final signature of a “name between names,” earning a renunciation of legal identity with felt cost. Interiority is embodied (label “rough or smooth, dense or gossamer”), and micro-choices (visiting 47-B at highest tide) align with motive. The flaw: agency tilts toward observation more than decisive action until the last beat, keeping it shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the wet-ink invitation and Mari’s triple signature crystallize her shift from solitary ghost to congregant witness, cost paid by accepting permanent namelessness. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each layered annotation tightens the pattern until the final testimony reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; no causal breaks. One causal leap (instant recognition of “people like her”) is minor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The container labyrinth is tactile—rust streaks, echo navigation, tide-lapped foundations—and constrains Mari’s stealth tactics and the final congregation site. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (“sound told her where walls had moved”). The tide’s clockwork supplies temporal pressure. A near-generic harbor skyline line is the only minor drag.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—testifying to erased existence—escalates via accumulating marginalia and the spring-tide deadline; the final signature forecloses any return to official life. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens, with one deepening (fresh ink summons) that narrows options. Cost is visible: permanent exile from the named world.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of erasure as both wound and power emerges through concrete acts (pencil annotations, poison label) rather than statement. The ending’s non-literal answer—“we who don’t exist must testify”—reweights prior images without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is congregation salvation or deeper exile?</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“groaned…harmonizing with the testimonies of the nameless”). Perceptual signature is distinct—memory felt as texture, sound as map. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is disciplined—metaphors (“watercolors,” “grammar of erasure”) serve theme. One mixed metaphor (“fabric unraveling” for words) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Premise of bureaucratic death as liberation is fresh; execution grounds it in sensory detail and social texture. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final choral image. No derivative echoes; specificity makes the container-archive inevitable.</comment>
