<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her pacifist stance is tested when her father arrives, forcing a micro-choice—teaching him to plant—that costs her the solitude of her practice. The father’s exhaustion and slow sheathing of the weapon show credible contradiction and earned change. Minor slip: “senselessly perceptive” is label-speak not fully dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory pass through the roses thickens the pattern until the father’s arrival breaks and reconfigures it. Closure is a Charged Poise—shared planting under the dome—whose cost is the father’s surrender of violence and Mira’s sharing of sanctuary. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The glass dome, desert roses, and scrap of ballast canvas are not backdrop but tools: the dome constrains climate and safety, the roses absorb spoken values, the canvas literally bears new seeds. Final image of father and daughter planting together reweights the dome from refuge to shared covenant. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserving life and continuity against inherited violence—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the armed father enters. One meaningful turn: he sheathes the weapon and kneels to plant. Cost is legible in his relinquished mission and Mira’s relinquished solitude. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via pattern density rather than causal chain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of continuity-through-care emerges from concrete acts—whispering values, planting seeds—not from assertion. Final image of parent and child sowing together offers non-literal answer to how life persists after catastrophe. Subtext in the father’s slow sheathing and silent touch of the rose carries apology and promise without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Mira’s perceptual signature: noticing “spaces between violence,” reading kindness like sunlight. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; compression is taught early (“engraved quiet”) and paid off in the closing cadence. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored to Mira.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; sentences advance multiple jobs—image, interiority, world-rule—without scaffold. Figurative language is disciplined; no mixed metaphors or loops. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she saw something shift”) is brief and voice-motivated. Final paragraph achieves quiet blaze through controlled cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-collapse father/daughter trope is transformed through the pacifist botanist daughter and the bounty hunter learning to plant. “Engraved quiet” as living pedagogy feels fresh and inevitable. Specificity of ballast-canvas seed pouch and desert roses anchors universals. Risk in quiet ending pays off with resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
