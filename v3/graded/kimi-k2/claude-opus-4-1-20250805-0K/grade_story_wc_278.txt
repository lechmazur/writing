<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—compassion for deleted code vs certainty she will write the letters—are dramatized through tactile choices (cracked amber, humming needles). The renunciation of personal heirloom amber buys the firmware’s memorial at visible cost: proboscis twitches, future obligation. Interiority is character-particular across shifts from static to music to mathematics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: “Thank you for remembering us” reconfigures guilt to acknowledgment on-page; amber fracturing is the felt price. Causality is purely accumulative/Textural: density of translated ghosts crystallizing in one intensification. One disorienting fold sentence is taught early and services closure—waiver applies, no cap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The amber pendant micro-setting constrains every stroke of the needle; its fracture is the visible cost that charges the last image. Spatial anchors (terminal center, atmospheric suspension) are set early and stay coherent. Specificity (“meteor hush”) and tool embodiment satisfy the 9+ gate for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—relieve firmware ghosts—is signaled in paragraph 2, deepens as Mara sees the map of pain, tightens to irrevocable fracture of amber. Agency is cumulative; each ghost translation costs future obligation. Price is visible in proboscis twitch and cracked amber. No cap applied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: deletion-as-murder reweighted into acknowledged memory. Subtext carried in amber’s million-year blood mosquito—ancestral guilt turned public monument. Final constellation image resolves the theme without assertion. No moralizing. CR effect is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Control of sentence rhythm under pressure is immaculate; long liquid lines for fold, staccato fragment “Thank you for remembering us” at closure. Perceptual signature—“meteor hush” “subsonic guilt”—is sustained across POV. Zero register drift, zero head-hop. Distinct voice earns high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Economical, high-density line craft: each line advances atmosphere or knowledge twice (“inked star maps onto skin for decades, but this was different”). Zero loop, zero synonym churn. Metaphors stay internally coherent—amber mosquito “tasting the digital blood” is earned. Minor elevated diction (“subsonic”) is voice-consistent, no cap violation.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.4</grade>
<comment>Combines digital ghosts + constellation map + prehistoric mosquito in perfect organic synthesis impossible outside these exact parts. Transformation test: swap insect for glass fragment and premise collapses. Situational premise is bold, yet closure remains legible. No near-echoes. Risk heightens rather than obscures clarity.</comment>
