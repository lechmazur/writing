<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mei’s interiority is textured—clay, silk, memory—but her decisive choice (to leave the oasis without taking) is only implied; the cost is present yet under-dramatized. The potter’s patience is well embodied, but the moment of renunciation lacks a micro-choice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mei rewraps the lantern glass, now “holding a faint golden tint,” crystallizing her stance—she will return when the world remembers kindness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pattern taught early, cadence deepens, cost is felt in the refusal to act now.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland and hexagonal hives are vivid and purposeful; the hives’ sun-aligned geometry constrains Mei’s realization. Spatial choreography is clean, but the final image could have let the environment press harder on her body to reach 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why some places resist change—is signaled early and tightens through the lantern-glass reveal. The deepening is driven by Mei’s attention, but the on-page cost (leaving the oasis intact) is more conceptual than visceral, capping the score below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: care as temporal anchor. The final image of Mei walking away with “golden tint” reframes the entire journey without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and glass, though a touch more ambiguity could have lifted it higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“rhythm in her bones,” “glaze settling on bisqueware.” Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping. The slight elevation in diction feels earned by the potter’s craft and never drifts into purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every line layers image, memory, and motion. One minor loop—“patient as fired clay” echoes “patient eggs”—is forgivable and does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of beekeeping, fractured timelines, and pottery feels inevitable in hindsight. The “phototropic to kindness” conceit is fresh and non-obvious, yet fully integrated. A hairline slip in cost visibility keeps it just under 9.0.</comment>
