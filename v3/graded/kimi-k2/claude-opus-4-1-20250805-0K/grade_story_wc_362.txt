<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is specific—her tactile communion with the prism and the frost-map feel lived-in—but the “thirty years as a mystic” backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, blunting the cost of her isolation. The final moment of triumph lands as earned because her earlier micro-choices (angling the prism, photographing the frost) directly precipitate it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: each absorbed emotion layers density until the frost lexicon ruptures the boundary between mind and matter. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the prism now holds her triumph—charged with the conceptual cost that her life’s work has become irreversible proof.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>The quartz arbor’s mist and humming pillars are vivid and selective, but they function more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint; the prism itself serves as micro-setting that ultimately charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate narrowly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving emotion-absorption—is signaled early and tightened once when the frost patterns crystallize into undeniable evidence. The cost is conceptual (her paradigm shift) rather than visceral, but it is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the porous boundary between subjective feeling and objective reality is dramatized through the prism’s frost lexicon. The final image reframes “truthful lies” into simple truth without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—“crystallized breath,” “emotional wavelengths”—that remains anchored in Vera’s perceptual bias. No POV slippage; the voice modulates with intensity as the frost reveals its map.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm is fluid, with purposeful variation in sentence length. Occasional elevated diction (“lexicon of feeling written in ice”) flirts with overwriting but stays within character lexicon. No loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The premise—objects as emotional archives—feels fresh because the frost-map mechanic is specific and rigorously followed. The synthesis of mysticism and empirical documentation is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
