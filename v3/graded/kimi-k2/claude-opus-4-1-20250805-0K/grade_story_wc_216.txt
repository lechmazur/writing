<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s borrowed-time status is embodied in tactile micro-choices—pressing the silo, feeling the urn’s warmth—rather than labels. Interior contradiction surfaces when he both clings to and releases numerical time. The final resolve to teach others is earned by the fragment’s sensory proof and carries visible cost: he steps into “uncertain chronology.”</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus crystallizes a new vocation, cost paid by the felt texture of “borrowed” days. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of encoded ads intensifies until the urn fragment reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The emerald silo’s crystalline walls and rust horizon are selective, tactile, and mirrored in Marcus’s temporal vertigo. The urn fragment functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure—cool surface, warm porcelain—charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to measure time once numbers fail—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each decoded ad tightens the noose of obligation until Marcus accepts the role of bridge. Cost is the surrender of certainty, felt in the final step outward.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: time as lived texture versus counted quantity. Subtext resides in the coded ads’ desperation and the urn’s shifting equations. Final image reframes prior motifs without moralizing—texture over tally—leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Marcus’s perceptual bias—numbers “lost their meaning,” time feels like “rough sandpaper.” Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping. Compression (“seventeen cycles—or was it seventy”) teaches the pattern early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and conceptual work. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. Rhythm accelerates during the urn’s warming, then exhales into the final line. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized time itself”) is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise—garage-sale warnings as temporal lifelines—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure holds under pressure. Specificity of 2019 ads and porcelain equations anchors universals. Transformation test: story collapses if any element is swapped.</comment>
