<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s grief-driven compulsion is embodied in every micro-choice—arranging blowers, conducting, singing lullabies—yet the interior contradiction (mournful yet eager) stays vivid. The final renunciation (he will return monthly) forecloses rest and carries felt cost. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. One reflective block (Bobby’s memory) is anchored by present cue and tilts tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Emma’s first real laugh reweights the premise that joy can be re-aerated. Causal chain—blower frequencies → tunnel physics → household vents—holds without gaps. Orientation anchored by line 3. Cost is legible in Marcus’s “mournfully eager” acceptance of perpetual duty. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tunnel’s limestone pores and ventilation shafts actively transmit sound; the leaf-blower semicircle constrains Marcus’s choreography. Sensory hierarchy (sound over sight) mirrors grief’s muffled quality. Micro-setting (pull-cord teeth) charges the final clinking cadence. Environment shapes tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore Hendricks laughter—signaled early. Escalation tightens once: mechanical choir → memory infusion → audible giggle. Cost is Marcus’s open-ended servitude. No coincidence resolves; agency remains causal. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of grief as sediment needing aeration emerges from concrete acts, never stated. Final image (clinking handles composing their own song) offers non-literal answer: haunting as stewardship. Subtext in “mournfully eager” reframes haunting from menace to mercy. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus; perceptual signature filters every detail through sound and wind. Syntax lengthens during conducting, compresses at fadeout. No dialogue, so voice coherence judged via internal texture. Distinct diction—“macerated more than flesh”—anchors voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers frequency, memory, and motion. Metaphors (handles like teeth, dust fine as grief) are precise and earned. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Final line’s clink is spare, resonant.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: leaf-blower symphony as elegiac technology. Tunnel acoustics as grief therapy is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (mechanical choir for mourning) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of “twelve leaf blowers singing middle C” prevents template drift.</comment>
