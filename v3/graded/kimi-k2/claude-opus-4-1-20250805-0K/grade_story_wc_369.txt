<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is textured—his weathered hands, the moonlight’s tingle, the “weight of absence”—but the decisive pivot from caretaker to re-architect of grief is compressed into a single beat. The 30-year tenure is asserted rather than embodied; we see the shift in purpose, not the accumulated scar tissue that would make the renunciation costlier. Still, his final smile carries a credible, earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus reassembles the sextant into moonlit “passages of light,” transforming the labyrinth from puzzle to grief-processor. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density (equations, mirrors, ivy) reweights the stake without causal reversals. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props or causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stormlit tower, broken dome, moonlit brass, and ivy constrain the final image: the sextant fragments must be re-installed before dawn. Micro-setting (the sextant itself) functions as both tool and map. Sensory selection is urgent—lightning flashes, moon-glow on mirrors—filtered through Marcus’s maintenance gaze. Spatial choreography is coherent; no floating rooms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform the labyrinth from unsolvable maze to navigable grief. Pressure tightens once: realization that the maze is meant to be inhabited, not solved, forces Marcus to act. Cost is the irreversible destruction of the antique instrument and the acceptance that his labor now serves sorrow rather than diversion. Agency drives the escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as quantifiable yet ultimately unanswerable. The astronomer’s equations encode loss; Marcus’s reassembly translates them into “something navigable.” Final image—ivy pulse, moonlight healing “forward to what might be”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext in etched mirrors and leaf-shadows deepens on reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is restrained, tactile, and maintenance-minded: “oiling the rotating walls,” “dusty floor.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, contracts under decision. No dialogue; interior monologue stays within Marcus’s lexicon. Compression (“three decades… crystallizing into purpose”) is taught early and paid off. Distinct perceptual signature sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense: “Each equation marked a specific kind of loss” compresses backstory and stakes. Metaphors are precise—“grief as growth rings.” No loops, no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm modulates with scene needs; final paragraph breathes. One minor scaffold: “He understood suddenly” could be tighter, but it does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a maintenance worker repurposes a broken navigational tool into an instrument for processing quantified sorrow. The transformation of the sextant from precision device to shattered lens feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity (microscopic notations, leaf-shadow equations) grounds the concept. Risky lyric compression succeeds without gimmickry.</comment>
