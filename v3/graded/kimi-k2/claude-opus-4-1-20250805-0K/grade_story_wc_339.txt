<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marina's "first name basis with death" trait is shown through concrete action—her decades listening to ocean death-whispers, the precise transmission transcription, her catalogued recoveries. Interiority reveals contradictory impulses: professional detachment versus private ache when the snow-globe mini-library mirrors her vocation. The final note ("every ending is a frequency shift") is earned by her witnessed micro-choice to document rather than to haul artifacts; she forecloses treasure-hunting and accepts archival immortality at visible cost. Emotion stays embodied, not labeled, and flaws (curator versus mourner tension) persist.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Narrative clearly operates under Accumulative/Textural lens: recurring images (death, transmission, nested snow globes) accumulate weight until the ending reconfigures meaning. All anchors (who/when/where) established by word 120 ("descended alone through the Pacific's crushing darkness"). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: Marina records her note, ascends, and breaks surface precisely as the library begins to flood—choice that costs her the physical discovery while birthing story-frequency. Causality stays coherent; no false teleportation or deus-transmission.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The sunken library is tactile: pressure-creaking hull, verdigris brass, air pocket "thick as centuries". Snow globe functions as micro-setting, constraining Marina's final movement—she must photograph quickly before pocket collapses. Sensory hierarchy obeys depth—taste of metallic darkness, headlamp carving silt. Setting details steer tactics and charge closure image ("sky the color of old brass").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is preservation versus dissolution framed from line 1. Pressure coheres when air pocket starts contracting, forcing Marina to choose archival preservation over physical loot. One meaningful tightening suffices: photographing journal before return, forfeiting the library itself for story-frequency. Cost (losing the intact library) is visible and integral to final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of "physics of letting go" emerges concretely—the snow globe's infinite regression models entropy, journal entries grow frantic then accepting. Closure image (ocean surface as "membrane between stories") makes letting go both conceptual and sensory cost. No authorial assertion; theme earned through Marina's micro-choice and the final re-cadence. Sophisticated melancholy modulates but doesn't resolve into moral.</comment>

<comment>Voice marries scientific precision with elegiac cadence—"electromagnetic whispers", "entropy syntax". Diction suits expert diver listening for dying frequencies. Sentence rhythm contracts under pressure ("photographing the pages, noting"). No POV slippage; perceptual signature vivid throughout. Final break-through line "toward light" maintains voice cohesion.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and free of loops. Only micro-repetition ("another legendary disappearance solved, another mystery...") is purposeful accumulative pattern. Strong verbs ("carved", "contracting") avoid filter verbs. One mixed metaphor "darkness thick as centuries" is intentional synesthesia and paid off at closure. Pronoun tracking clean; no clarity gaps.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Concept—final transmission as invitation to embrace impermanence—is fresh twist on Atlantis-lite trope. Snow globe infinite recursion is non-obvious entropy model. Earhart parallel used not for nostalgia but thematic pivot: finding shrinks myth, library preserves myth. Risky closing image justified by prior pattern. Specificity elevates familiar material.</comment>
