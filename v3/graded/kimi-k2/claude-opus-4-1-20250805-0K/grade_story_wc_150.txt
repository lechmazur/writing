<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Warm presence, but Miriam's internal split (flight vs tending) dramatized only at the finish; deeper contradiction under pressure would elevate. Relationships and status handled succinctly between Miriam & Yakov.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal-clear closure: the fitted gnomon reconfigures Miriam’s future and charges the graves with ancestral accountability. Accumulative lens holds—earthquake, graves, sundial accumulate until the final image lands cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard tombscape is tactile, coherent, and constrains every footstep; roots embracing marble anchor spatial danger. Micro-setting success: bronze sundial itself functions as a charged object that guides the last choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belief vs exile—tightens one notch when Miriam kneels to fit the pointer; cost is the exile’s return itself. No reversals more than the single, potent deepening needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Theme of circular time and diaspora reseeds organically through olive pits and carved names; final image answers the thematic question without sermon, yielding earned, hushed awe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Voice stays lyrical yet grounded in soil and bone; filter-verb count remains low. Compression like “interrupt ed journeys where she’d board trains that dissolved” is taught pattern that pays off in closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Rich figurative runs occasionally flirt with slight overgrowth, but rhythm matches the slow archaeology of memory; every dig, root, fruit earns its sentence. No clarity-break in final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>The catacomb orchard, graft of death and food, feels specific and impossible to transpose. Olive roots knitting femurs reframes exhumation as cultivation—fresh synthesis under pressure.</comment>
