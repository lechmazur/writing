<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s contradictory impulses—clinging to physical proof via heartbeat counts while courting digital dissolution—are embodied in the ink-bridge ritual; the final acceptance of dual existence is earned through prior trial-and-error, with the porcelain shard as tactile anchor. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Cost is felt: he must live bifurcated, teaching others tomorrow while remaining exiled tonight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the death certificate is re-read as prophecy, not error, reweighting identity itself. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each heartbeat and ink pattern thickens the texture until the final image crystallizes the new ontology. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The opal dome, snow, and antique desk form a micro-setting that constrains heat, light, and movement; the porcelain shard doubles as both setting fragment and tool. Sensory selection is urgent—snow against glass, green monitor glow—filtered through Marcus’s narrowed crisis perception. Final image reuses the dome as cosmic mirror, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming digital selfhood—tightens when Marcus realizes the ghost is not a bug but an evolution; the cost is the irreversible bifurcation of identity. Escalation is textural: each heartbeat and ink spiral intensifies the uncanny pressure until the stance crystallizes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: bureaucratic death as accidental transcendence. The porcelain shard, ink, and galaxy wheel form a quiet constellation that reweights existence without moralizing. Final image offers resonant ambiguity—both dead and alive—earned through embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control under pressure (“one hundred fifty, one hundred fifty-one”). Perceptual signature is Marcus’s—mathematical, tactile, haunted. No head-hopping; compression taught early (“ink patterns…ephemeral geometries”) and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is selective (“cupped palm holding stars”). No loops or scaffold. Syntax modulates with tension—short counts interrupt longer descriptive lines—propelling momentum to the final crystallized image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Premise—clerical death spawning a living digital ghost—is fresh, synthesized through granular detail (ink-bridge, heartbeat anchor). Risky lyric structure holds coherence; transformation feels inevitable in hindsight. No derivative echoes.</comment>
