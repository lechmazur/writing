<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thomas’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradictory impulses of skepticism and forgiveness play out in micro-choices (pocketing the tooth, returning it). Elara’s presence supplies relational pressure that alters their shared state. The final renunciation—letting her leave—carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality. Only a slight drift toward therapeutic self-diagnosis keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Thomas’s forgiveness crystallizes into a new stance, reconfiguring both siblings’ options while the garden’s charged image lingers. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence tighten toward the final beat. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the tooth’s return and the unbridgeable hedge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The garden, fountain, and hedge function as micro-setting that constrains movement and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; jasmine and impossible blooms mirror internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is coherent; the hedge’s threshold enforces the parting. Falls just short of 9.0 because the garden’s rules remain slightly dream-soft rather than materially constraining.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Thomas can forgive and coexist with the changeling sister—is signaled early and tightened once when he returns the tooth, foreclosing reunion. Pressure grows under Accumulative lens via charged imagery and withheld embrace. Cost is felt in the final separation. Could be sharper if the Council’s disapproval had bitten deeper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: mercy and innovation born from brokenness. The garden’s out-of-season jasmine and the bone-setting metaphor reweight “mistakes into constellations” without moralizing. Final image of intertwined nostalgia and innovation offers resonant, non-literal answer. No thematic drift or sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Thomas’s perceptual signature; syntax mirrors his cautious wonder. Compression and elision (“less certain but more sure”) are taught early and paid off. Dialogue carries subtext and distinct cadence. Minor convergence in Elara’s speech is acceptable under emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical without purple overload; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats. One near-repeat (“where broken things learned to grow differently”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fairy-tale tropes are inverted: the changeling is loved, the healer is skeptical, mercy is innovation. Specificity of the tooth, garden, and bone-setting gives fresh inflection. The synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in quiet lyric closure pays off.</comment>
