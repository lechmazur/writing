<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Yann’s interior contradiction—knowing each capture yet still performing it—remains sharply embodied; the final understanding (“my promise has just begun”) crystallizes with felt cost. No secondary character is on stage, so relationship crucible does not apply.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is cleanly inferred—the piece teaches its patterned lyric mode, then lands an unmistakable Resonant Reconfiguration (Yann placing new stones for a future apprentice). Closure carries explicit conceptual cost: stewardship across borrowed dawns, foreclosing personal rest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Aurora and painted stones function as micro-setting that constrains every movement; star dust’s warmth against her hip and bioluminescent spiral equations directly charge the final image. Spatial choreography and world logic stay consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—understanding the promise—tightens from precognitive curse to generational stewardship. Agency narrows when she re-stones the bluff, accepting endless vigilance as visible cost. Escalation grows via intensified pattern and charged final responsibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme (generational custodianship of cosmic memory) emerges implicitly via concrete objects and action; no meta commentary intrudes. Aurora-as-memory-veil reweights the opening promise, leaving resonant ambiguity without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is singular, textured, and purposefully lyric; perceptual signature is consistent. Deliberate syntax and metaphoric layering match the Accumulative/Textural mode without obscuring clarity; no POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with scene pressure; “aurora writhed,” “spacetime had crumpled like paper” propel narrative without clutter. No paraphrase loops evident; information density remains high and closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eel herders in a frictionless reality, grandmothers encoding cosmic memory into stone spirals—each element is original yet inevitable in hindsight. The risk (cosmic memory via eels) heightens stakes while preserving clarity; no derivative cues intrude.</comment>
