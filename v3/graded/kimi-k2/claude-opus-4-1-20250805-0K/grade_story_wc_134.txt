<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera’s interiority is vivid—her teeth ache from the pearl’s hum, her foresight dissolves like sugar—but the moment of “expanding” into shadows is reported rather than embodied, blunting the cost of her transformation. The pilgrim’s off-stage vanishing leaves the relationship crucible unused. Still, the earned shift from clairvoyant to present-witness is credible and carries felt loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Vera exits with altered sight and luminescent palm, the cost legible in the pearl’s dissolution. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each crystal note layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. Minor ellipsis in how the pearl actually re-tunes her perception keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The cave’s bioluminescent veins and singing crystals are selective, tactile, and mirrored in Vera’s shifting perception. The setting constrains her choices—darkness forces reliance on pearl and shadow—and the final image of “bright darkness” is charged by the environment itself. A hair more spatial choreography during the shadow-coalescence would have secured 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—loss and recovery of sight—is signaled early and tightens once: the pearl dissolves, foresight returns transformed. The pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no false reversals. Cost is visible (pearl gone, skin luminescent) but could be sharper—e.g., a concrete limitation in her new sight—to reach 8.2+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the quiet magic of the present versus the drama of prophecy. Subtext lives in gesture—the pearl hums, shadows breathe—without sermon. Final image of “bright darkness” offers non-literal resonance. A touch less explicit voice-of-the-cave exposition would have lifted it higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“shadows seemed to breathe and shift independent of any light source”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Vera notices futures as “silver threads,” later hears crystals “singing themselves into existence.” No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Occasional elevated diction (“altogether other”) slightly jars but fits the mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences layer sensory and conceptual work. Minor loop—“the way dust motes become golden in afternoon light, how strangers' paths cross...”—reads like a brief catalogue rather than pressure. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks. A single paraphrase loop near the end keeps it from 8.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of clairvoyance trope with micro-magic of dust motes and overlapping shadows feels fresh and inevitable. Risk in voiding the protagonist’s signature power pays off via earned reconfiguration. No close echoes; the cave’s sentient darkness is particular to this voice. Slight deduction for familiar “ancient harmonies” phrasing.</comment>
