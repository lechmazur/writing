<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thrain’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her tactile reading of scorched pages and the spiral-stair perception shift feel lived. Motivation (“tend the echo”) is consistent, yet the final renunciation of departure lacks a prior dramatized temptation, blunting the cost. Still, her contradictory impulse to stay while sensing the axis turn is palpable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bronze quiet becomes a charged pause, axis shift reweighted. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each diary and wall-whisper layers density until the tapestry reconfigures reality. Cost is felt in Thrain’s solitary endurance; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo is rendered through lived detail—grain scars, cold paper air, spiral stairs—each constraining movement and perception. The fireplace’s half-burned diaries function as micro-setting that enables the final discovery. Environment and object together charge the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve stories for the next axial turn—is signaled early and tightened when Thrain chooses to stay. Pressure deepens as diaries reveal the turning; her final renunciation forecloses departure with visible solitude as cost. One meaningful intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical reality-slippage emerges organically from tapestry, diaries, and wall-murmurs. Final image of bronze quiet as heartbeat pause offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in “dragons knew” and child’s tilted silo drawing deepens the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, tactile, slightly archaic without pastiche. Perceptual signature (“tasted of old paper and older secrets”) remains consistent. Compression and elision (“the dragons began to move”) are taught early and paid off in the spiral-stair consciousness slide.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Minor register elevation (“existential axis”) is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise of post-human librarians tending wall-memories while reality’s axis drifts is fresh and fully committed. Medieval tapestry as star-map and dragons as markers transform familiar motifs. Risky lyric structure pays off in the charged final pause.</comment>
