<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is textured and embodied—her palm on stone, the “weight” of legacy—yet her final choice to leave her notebook feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrestled with; the cost is legible but not viscerally struggled. The contradiction between solitude and communal memory is present but not fully dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: Mira’s act of adding her own whisper to the wall reconfigures her stance from solitary reader to active contributor, paying the cost of perpetuating the burden. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each recovered echo layers density until the final image crystallizes the theme.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The ivy-veiled passage is not mere backdrop; its acoustics and physical encroachment constrain movement and shape the extraction work. The fireplace as micro-setting delivers the diaries that pivot the plot, while the limestone’s molecular memory charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—preserving human memory against green erasure—tightens when Mira learns the walls already hold archives; her choice to add her own voice narrows her future to perpetual caretaking. The cost is conceptual but felt.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as communal responsibility versus individual solitude. The final notebook placement reframes prior material without moralizing, letting the ivy and stone carry the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical yet grounded in sensory detail; “green corridors that whisper with their own peculiar acoustics” teaches the pattern early. No head-hopping; POV stays tightly anchored to Mira’s trained perception.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic, with high information density—each sentence advances setting, character, or theme. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) is brief and voice-motivated; no loops or mixed metaphors mar the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of acoustic archaeology with post-climate ruin feels fresh and inevitable; the ivy as living archive transforms a familiar eco-collapse trope into a resonant memory system. Risk-taking in structure (lyric accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
