<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s contradictory impulses—saving vs. exploiting the chameleon—are dramatized through embodied micro-choices (surgery, confession draft). The final renunciation is earned and carries visible cost (sanctuary closure, legal peril). Interiority avoids label-speak; shame is shown in trembling fingers and glass-touch. One slip: “I told myself I was saving you” edges toward self-diagnosis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Marina’s confession and reattachment foreclose the deception path with undeniable cost. Causal lens holds—each removal of hardware tightens the vice of exposure. Orientation is swift; mist, redwoods, and glass roof anchor by line 3. No teleporting props; the tail’s reattachment is the decisive physical act that crystallizes the moral shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The misty workshop under star-slotted glass functions as micro-setting: the glass roof becomes a “window into judgment,” constraining Marina’s self-exposure. Sensory selection is urgent—moonlight on severed tail, dawn seeping through canopy. Spatial choreography is clean; tail, terrarium, and phone track without drift. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. survival—signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation tightens once: each bio-chip removed strips away a layer of deception and raises the cost of exposure. The final act of reattachment and confession narrows options to surrender. Agency is hers; coincidence never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of fragile convictions emerges from the chameleon’s literal fragility and Marina’s moral collapse. No explicit moralizing; the final image of the lizard “just alive” reweights the premise with quiet conceptual cost. Subtext operates in gesture—her finger on the glass barrier she built. Complexity lingers: children’s wonder was real even if the rainbow was not.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical yet precise: “chromatic dance,” “shimmering stillness.” Perceptual signature is Marina’s—scientific diction (“subcutaneous light emitters”) fused with moral dread. No POV leakage; sensory hierarchy reflects her veterinary training. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during surgery, longer cadences at dawn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, dense, and propulsive. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Figurative language is selective—“stars pierced through gaps” is earned. Technical detail is accurate and character-bound. Final line crystallizes without overwriting: “just a lizard now, just alive.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The genetic-mod chameleon as metaphor for manufactured identity feels fresh, not gimmick. Transformation test: swap species or setting and the moral calculus collapses. Risky choice to hinge closure on quiet reattachment rather than courtroom drama pays off; the image of the ordinary tail gripping a twig is indelible. No derivative echoes.</comment>
