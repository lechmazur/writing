<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Guardian’s feral descent—bones of winter glass inside her ribs, pupils gone vertical—rings embodied and singular. Interior conflict fissures cleanly when scholar offers double homecoming: ransom her frozen vigil or risk final oblivion. The moment she relinquishes the pendant, loss (armor of certainty) and gain (restored language) clash in one charged poise. Grade dents not at closure but where earlier description slips into compressed, almost mythic shorthand—still, choice feels earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cumulative/Textural lens: the garden’s ever-thickening cold mirrors the guardian’s interior crystallization until both thaw under shared risk. Closure earns Resonant Reconfiguration—weight of pendant transfers, frozen garden liquefies, uncertainty re-weaponized as bridge. Key causal stitches intact; only micro ellipsis when scholar voices “make friends with not knowing” feels slightly compressed. Holds lens to final sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Selective sensory slivers—mist like broken glass, footprints that refuse to mark—tether us to barefoot freezing stakes. Pendant and garden both constrain: one forbids departure, the other anchors the scholar’s crossing. Master-coordinated tone of frost dread without ornament overload. Minor drift: hedge maze references verge on fantasy shorthand, yet topography remains coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rescue two trapped souls versus irrevocable feral lock-in. Pressure thickens via mirrored ice inside the body and scholar’s looming deadline; single, irreversible narrowing when pendant moves to rescuer. Encounter cost exacted in relinquished talisman and self-rebuilt identity. One tiny coincidence—scholar arrives exactly now—acknowledged and accepted by situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from literal question: what does one trade to belong, and can home ever be reclaimed after monstrous adaptation? Ledger is left open; no moralizing, only price—guardian’s vanishing feral armor and scholar’s doubled gamble. Final luminous dissolving of boundaries both answers and reposes the question. Avoids tidy allegory despite “light edges” conceit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fourth-wall narrator channels guardian’s half-animal idiom: synesthetic metaphors (“text-parasites’ whisper”), clipped ambiguity when language decays. Sensory hierarchy shifts—cold over smell, vertical sight over colour—feel character-bound. Rhythm pares to a heartbeat during silence with scholar, swells into lyric cascade in epiphany. No POV bleed; scholar’s minimal dialogue credible and distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose near choral: every descriptor works double duty, e.g., “leaves no prints in the frost” reveals both locus and dematerialization. Rhythm breathes with pressure, accelerates in leap into light. No synonym loops or filter stacks; two conjoined clauses (“not ending at boundaries but dissolving them”) hit drum cadence that closure redeems. Minor diction vault—“ostentatiously lyric” once in bedsheets isn’t quite audible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Transforms portal-home tropes into articular, embodied ordeal; the feral librarian is fresh mythos. Pendant’s exchange turns artifact from shackle to key without supernatural retconning. “Uncertainty as necessary companion” weaponized as travel method feels both intuitive and daring. No stock baroque or frozen-garden Gothic cliché escapes metamorphosis.</comment>
