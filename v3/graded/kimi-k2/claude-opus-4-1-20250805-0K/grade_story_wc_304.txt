<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her measured breaths, steady hands, the contradiction of preserving beauty while death closes in. The shift from beautician to mortician to threshold-keeper is dramatized through micro-choices (harvesting the chip, tracing symbols, pressing it to the star’s heart). The final stance—choosing eternal almostness—carries visible cost as the Silence locks her in place. Only the “lucidly watchful” label feels slightly external; the rest is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the star rises, Mira and it suspended in radiant hush, cost paid in frozen motion. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of stillness increases until the final crystallized aurora. Causality is lyric but legible: each deliberate gesture accumulates toward the preserved spark. No orientation debt; anchors (skyborne grotto, Silence tide) are clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The grotto’s crystallized cloud and aurora tethering are not backdrop; they supply the only moving cover Mira can hide within and the literal table for the star. The emerald chip functions as micro-setting, constraining the final infusion. Sensory selection narrows to aurora light and Silence glass, mirroring Mira’s narrowed options. One minor slip—“vast and cooling on her table” could be more tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the last spark before universal stillness—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is the Silence’s rising tide; each beat tightens the noose until the final crystallization. Agency: Mira’s deliberate gestures create the bubble of almostness; luck does not solve. Cost is the forfeiture of all future motion, legible in the frozen cathedral image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the fusion of beauty and death into a third state—radiant hush—without moralizing. The emerald chip’s song and the star’s suspended eyes reweight the premise: stillness can be generative. Subtext lives in gesture (pressing chip to heart) and silence. Final image offers non-literal answer: death made beautiful enough to live.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“crystallized cloud,” “aurora’s magnetic breath,” “radiant hush”—consistent with Mira’s trained attention to beauty. Syntax modulates: longer cadences for wonder, clipped fragments under pressure (“One last spark”). No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Mira’s perception. Compression is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective—no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with tension: “The Silence crept upward daily” vs. “The emerald chip began to sing.” No loops or scaffold. Minor filter verb in “she understood now” but forgiven under lyric mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—beautician-mortician preserving a dying star in a sky-grotto against universal stillness—is non-obvious and fully committed. Tropes (last star, apocalypse) are transformed through tactile specificity and the final suspension. Risky lyric structure pays off in the Charged Poise ending. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
