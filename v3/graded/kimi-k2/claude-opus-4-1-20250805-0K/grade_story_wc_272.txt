<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her trembling fingers, cracked voice, and charcoal-stained sketches anchor her crisis. The contradiction between her need to paint truth and her terror of fragmentation is dramatized in real time, culminating in the earned choice to embrace “magnificently shattered” portraiture. The cost—loss of her former celebrated self—is legible in the final image. Minor slip: the phrase “necessary darkness” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting the edge of embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marina’s stance crystallizes into a new artistic ethic, charged by the lighthouse beam blazing in impossible directions. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory intensification (walls breathing, glass falling upward) layers pressure until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is coherent within its surreal logic; no teleporting props or retroactive patches. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits the safety of “painting what’s real.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse-library is rendered with tactile specificity—salt-stained belly, splintered tarot box, dead beacon fire—each detail constrains Marina’s choices (charcoal source, collapsing space). The setting evolves: walls shift from crushing to embracing, mirroring her internal shift. The final beam recharging the motif satisfies the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite surrealism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to paint truth in a fracturing world—is signaled early and tightened through sensory escalation. Agency is exercised when Marina begins sketching on the cards, foreclosing her old method. The cost is the terror of descending into “necessary darkness.” One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the wholeness within fragmentation. No moralizing; the final image of “magnificently shattered” portraits offers a non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture—the tarot cards’ shifting images, the upward-falling glass—rather than exposition. The ache of existing in multiple possibilities lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, painterly, salted with maritime decay. Perceptual signature is consistent: Marina notices through an artist’s eye (watercolors bleeding, cubist nightmare). Compression and elision (“six months ago”) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Metaphors are precise—“lighthouse’s salt-stained belly,” “charcoal from the long-dead beacon fire.” No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with pressure. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrasing, but it does not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—portraitist in a reality that literally fragments faces—is fresh, synthesized through Marina’s specific crisis. Surreal elements (glass falling upward, cards showing impossible scenes) are grounded in her perceptual logic. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk-taking (collapsing lighthouse as psychic crucible) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
