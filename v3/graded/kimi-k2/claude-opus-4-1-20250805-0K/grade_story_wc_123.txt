<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elena’s compulsion to preserve exact data in defiance of state erasure is embodied in micro-actions (steady finger on clasps, jasmine-petal bookmarks) and contradictory impulses (solitude vs. silent alliance) with credible cost; the final renunciation—continued surveillance while planting redundant truth-caches—forecloses any retreat and is fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise crystallized in Elena’s reply-into-shadow: “Atmospheric pressure dropping steadily… Wind speeds sufficient for your purposes.” The causal logic—years of filed data → internal storm → northern breach forecast—remains intact, and the price (permanent complicity in civil uprising) is visible in the single illuminated sentence.</comment>

<comment>The abandoned sectors beyond the quarantine wall, Elena's barometer, the pigeon’s aluminum warmth—each detail is filtered through Elena’s scientific gaze and constrains the final choice (instruments now dual-use recording devices). Spatial choreography stays locked; dusk courtyard as micro-bastion where observation becomes insurrection.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake signaled early: "your integrity preserved what they tried to erase." Pressure coheres when the threat—her storm logs weaponized—forces Elena to trade passive observation for active cooperation. Escalation tightens once when she plans redundant caches; no second reversal required; felt cost secured.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete acts: meticulous measurement as quiet resistance. Subtext thrives in silence (noteless state, unheard reply), culminating in the charged image of the pigeon disappearing with data that may destroy or redeem the zone. No moralizing; resonance grows from particular acts rather than thesis statements.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice remains Elena’s scientist-poet dual register: precise diction (barometric, anemometer) braided with lyrical exactitude (“walls that pooled in amber light”). Internal texture consistent; syntax modulates from catalogic calm to taut directive. No unmotivated drift; perceptual signature distinct under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is luminous and propulsive: information stacked in rhythmic, sensor-specific bursts; sentences advance both atmospheric charge and plot. Only minor scaffold phrase—“she understood”—appears once; loops absent. Word selection exact (“barometric pressure gauge”), metaphors organic (“a maze of her movements”).</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of dystopian surveillance with gentle ornithological intrigue; transforming weather data into insurgent code feels inevitable yet unclichéd. Final reweighting—truth records become detonation triggers—boldly risks political clarity without sentimental safety. Specific lived detail (lavender petals pressed in log) anchors universals.</comment>
