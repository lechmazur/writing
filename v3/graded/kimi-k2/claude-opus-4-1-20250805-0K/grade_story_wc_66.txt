<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mariel’s compulsion to preserve music under totalitarian pressure is rendered through delicate embodied choices—transcribing notes in amber light, mixing ink with dust, choosing cloak over candle—each a micro-choice that escalates risk; the inner contradiction between obedience and rebellion is sustained without sentimentality, and her final act of wrapping scores in dust carries earned, visible cost, marking meaningful change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The causality leans Causal: because Mariel hears the pirate broadcast, therefore she embeds its cipher within the symphony, therefore the secretly luminous notes will activate in performance—each linkage tightens options and raises stakes; closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the dust reawakens under the final chord, with conceptual cost legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ember alcove is more than backdrop: its retained heat anchors the misty night, the dial glow becomes the sole illumination dictating ink tone, and the dust itself functions as micro-setting that absorbs and later radiates luminous narrative; spatial choreography holds when Mariel steps into dawn with scores wrapped, as the heat wicks away through her cloak.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake is the restoration of narrative through music under threat of silencing; escalation comes via the pirate broadcast narrowing Mariel’s choices—she must risk discovery or lose the rebellion’s signal—then the luminous notes tighten stakes again by linking performance with inevitable exposure; the cost is the copyist’s anonymity and safety.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—the redemptive persistence of story—emerges organically from each beat: burning books → harvesting silent dust → coaxing dust to remember; the final image of audience members inhaling narrative spores reconfigures hope without a sermon, leaving a resonant non-literal answer to the famine’s aftermath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The third-person limited voice is precise and charged, routing perception through ink-stained fingers and amber haze; perceptual signature is consistent—the narrator notices aches of hand joints under stress and the faint phosphorescence of ink before anyone else does—without head-hopping or filter-verb slippage; rhythmic control sharpens under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose exhibits high information density without clutter: “amber light painting her fingers” condenses color, material, and consequence into one stroke; figurative language is selective rather than ornamental, and no scaffold or loops appear; rhythm accelerates during transcription beats and breathes during radio static, maintaining clarity and propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The pirate-broadcast-as-cipher angle feels inevitable in hindsight: censors treated music as mere transcription, music proved it could still speak—yielding a fresh synthesis that resists both dystopian and rebel-liberation clichés; the risk to Mariel’s anonymity deepens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
