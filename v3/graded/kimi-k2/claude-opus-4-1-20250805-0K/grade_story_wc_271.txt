<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Amira’s interior contradiction—grief vs. cultivation—drives every micro-choice; the pruning, transplanting, and final drive home all enact her refusal to surrender memory while renouncing vengeance. Embodied emotion (tremor, heat in palms) is specific, never diagnostic. The Earned Stasis of continuing to plant, with dirt still under her nails, carries visible cost and forecloses easier absolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of cultivation against erasure tightens through sensory density and cadence shift. Closure is Charged Poise—final sweep of the automated beacon crystallizes the coexistence of violence and persistence without resolving it. Cost is legible in the indelible dirt beneath her fingernails and the photograph’s burned edge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clifftop arboretum, cedar bark, salt wind, and automated beacon are vivid, selective, and filtered through Amira’s trauma-sharpened perception. The cedar as centuries-old witness constrains her panic and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; every object (pruners, jade cutting, photograph) is handled and tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: how to keep living after annihilating loss. Pressure escalates via somatic markers that threaten relapse; each act of cultivation is a tightening choice that forecloses surrender to despair. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is internal and ecological. Cost is the unending labor of planting against inevitable future loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between destruction and slow regeneration; no explicit statement, only the indifferent growth of plants against human violence. Subtext lives in the photograph’s half-obscured smile and the lighthouse’s mindless rotation. Final image reframes optimism as stubborn, unheroic continuation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in sensory specificity; syntax lengthens with reflection, shortens with somatic threat. No dialogue, yet interior monologue avoids therapy-speak. Distinct perceptual signature: noticing leaf nodes, engine timbres, soil temperature. Patterned elision (e.g., the bombing) is taught early and paid off in the photograph’s burn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers action, memory, and sensory detail without redundancy. Metaphors (compass finding north, pearl of stillness) are precise and earned. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with emotional pressure. Opening and closing lines echo via light and dirt, bookending the arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Familiar trauma-recovery arc is transformed through ecological metaphor and quiet botanic resistance. The fusion of drone-strike survivor with plant-propagation healer feels non-obvious and inevitable. Specificity of place (abandoned arboretum, automated beacon) and occupation (self-taught horticulturist) grounds the concept. Risk-taking in the understated ending pays off.</comment>
