<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s solitude delivers interiority of exquisite particularity—“fingers tingle under gloves”; internal contradictions felt in real time; final stance of teaching carries visible cost of abandoning Guild security; flaw of assumption-rejection drives her every beat. Only absence of on-page companion limits relationship crucible, but solo voice is coherent and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure image rewrites the premise: silence becomes generative not null—a Resonant Reconfiguration charged with conceptual cost of disavowing her former livelihood; drive lens is Accumulative/Textural as the pattern of “ending → beginning” tightens from fragment glow to dawn-lit promise; no causality breaks; moon timing pays off earlier signal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Deserted dish-array city swaying on cables materially conditions every moment (height danger, wind song, mineral rain scent) and serves as micro-setting that constrains escape routes and supplies the tower ladder decision; gorge mist, lunar perigee, and seismic cable sway persist to the closing image, grounding the cosmic leap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single dominant stake signaled in line 3: “hunt impossible”—a shard of hush; escalation arises by gravitational narrowing of options under lunar perigee and fragment burnout (persistent physical price), culminating in renunciation of Guild path with tangible loss of recorded transmission; sufficient tightness for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges purely through Maya’s sensorium and final decision rather than exposition: endings breed beginnings felt in pulse, taste, and metal sway; final image reweights all prior static as fertile hush; complexity preserved, sermon avoided; insight paid for with livelihood sacrificed, thematic cost legible in dawn light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Voice melds hard SF instrumentality with near-poetic compression—“congregation of metal prophets” stays within Maya’s interpretive gaze; no dialogue to misalign; free-indirect pacing scales with lunar drag; perceptual signature distinctive and unobtrusive syntactic elision sustained to reverberant last line “profound music of the space between”.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Prose is textured, dense, and propulsive—one minor mixed‐metaphor slip (“amber shadows across weathered equipment”) at 0.1 severity; no loops, scaffold or synonym stacks; high information ratio; diction stays within character lexicon; rhythm modulates with tower sway climax; no mechanical flaws near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Synth of abandoned radio ruin + celestial linguistics + esoteric “beginning-in-ending” cosmology constitutes fresh non-obvious synthesis; inverted Guild cosmology rendered lived in Maya’s fingertips rather than concept dump; risk succeeds without gimmick—every strangeness grounded in sensory evidence earned through her night on the tower.</comment>
