<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s interior conflict and micro-decisions under pressure are vivid; only minor generic phrasing dilutes the full 9-point punch. Renunciation to “return differently” is earned through felt cost on the nexus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural. Charged Poise in final shell-sun image reweights prior material; only slight orientation drift in “three years” backstory mildly dilutes immediacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ember nexus constrains tactics twice: cooling surface checks speed, dying embers limit tools; atmospheric specificity slightly outruns function in twilight glow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Internal stakes (competence vs. memory grief) escalate to symbolic pocket-sun resolution; external pressure remains soft via Marcus role, not a true antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of presence emerges through concrete particulars—spiral shell, nexus chill—without sermonizing; final reweighting of “density of presence” crystallizes ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vocal control under lyric mode; compression/ patterned elision taught through twilight motifs, paid off in shell-sun hum—no head-hopping but slight lush cadence repetition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and vivid; occasional overwritten metaphor (“calcium and carbon”) in closure beat nudges it off the 7.5 line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fusion of alchemical science with memory grief synthesizes fresh angle on “capture present”; risk-taking lyric mode strengthens but doesn’t break structure or clarity.</comment>
