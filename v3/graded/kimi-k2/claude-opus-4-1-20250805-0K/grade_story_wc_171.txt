<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—raw grief weaponized into patient diplomacy—are embodied in her handling of the clipboard and the choice to jettison ritual grievance. The final gesture renounces vengeance while costing her the tidy closure of heroic status. Only one character acts and speaks on stage, so relationship crucible is moot. Micro-choice of turning the clipboard toward the delegates pivots the entire scene. No label-speak or stock emotional summary; interiority stays concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each failed treaty glows denser across the memory-glass, accruing unbearable mass until Mara reframes failure itself as the shared heritage. Closure image—“new light…like suns touching”—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration: past red failures, future not-yet-gold, crystallizing the new common stance with undeniable social cost of abandoning triumphalist identity. Anchors (terrace, twin stars, 300-year cycle) are up within 80 words and remain stable. No teleport or amnesia; causality is driven by accumulated weight rather than sudden turns.</comment>

<comment>The terrace functions as micro-setting and moral fulcrum—“stones held the ritual significance of ten thousand ceremonies”—later constraining negotiations under shadow-free midsummer alignment. Ebony clipboard and memory-glass object-as-setting are re-handled; clipboards and terrace together steer the only viable surface where “something painful and necessary and true” can occur. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's negotiator eye (translucent Theren bones, heavy Kolani movement). Minor time/physics stretches in “twin suns crawl” read as lyrical license rather than error.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is ending the generational war or admitting unhealable complicity. Escalation happens via intensifying honesty—abandoning staged grievance itself becomes the decisive tightening that narrows every future option to shared brokenness. The cost is legible: each lineage concedes monstrous complicity on the terrace’s stones under coronal light. No deus ex; the shift is propelled solely by Mara’s speech act and the physical return of names to clipboard—agency remains causally local.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specifics: clipboard catalogues real murders; “we are not the heroes” refuses redemption myths. The final image—red glow shifting to intermediate, painful light—offers a resonant, non-literary answer where neither victory nor absolution is granted. Deepens via personal grief without preaching; “redemption is bought with admission” arises as lived consequence rather than slogan. Complexity remains: hatred’s inheritance is unhealed, merely named.</comment>

<comment>Mara’s perceptual signature is distinctive: violence reformatted into slow art, architectural grief as engineering. Syntax modulates with scene demand—open with languid celestial observation, tighten to surgical sentences during the reversal. Ritual language compressed yet audible: “celestial bodies continued their slow dance” juxtaposed against brutal, colloquial “killing children”. No register drift. Dialogue minimal but goal-driven; aide’s single intrusive line is clipped, functional.</comment>

<comment>Prose is rhythmic and compressed; sentences fold multiple jobs—description, motivation, micro-action—without stall. Filter-verbs are minimal; internal texture remains tactile. Only soft scaffolds: two adjacent “ceremonies” might shave repetition but rhythm justifies. Metaphors (bleeding suns, memory-glass) stay internally consistent. No strained purple or therapy-speak. Final image’s “painful and necessary and true” triplet risks echo but lands as earned mantra under charged poise.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: centuries of failed treaties reframed as priceless archive of shared culpability. Transformation rather than twist—clipboard as marriage recorder turned death ledger turned new light reservoir emerges naturally from established world. Stakes hinge on refusing standard victory narrative; that inversion feels inevitable only after final paragraph re-illuminates prior “constellation of almost-peace”. Sufficient particularizing of alien biology (crystalline bones, crystalline song) without exotic tourism.</comment>
