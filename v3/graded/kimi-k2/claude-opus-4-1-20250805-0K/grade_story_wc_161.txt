<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Margot's interiority is rich, driving every micro-choice; the layered reinvention thread and avian empathy are vivid. Cost is felt when burning her past, then again in the music-box closure. Flaws (paranoia, guilt) motivate plot turns with earned inevitability.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: the meteorite’s final reprise crystallizes identity shift and the price of rewriting truth. Causal chain (accident → archives → music-box → self-renewal) is tight under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Skylight dust and attic ledger become active tools: Margot reads patterns that coach next beats. Objects pigeons, meteorite, box—all stage and charge the image, making micro-setting indispensable to the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Stake evolves from survival to rewriting identity; pressure tightens when Theodore reveals the echo pigeon letter. The closure reweights meaning and forecloses flight without devolving into external coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through omission and the cost of preserving loss: “truth lives in the spaces between words.” Final dust-mote map serves CR, reconfiguring memory without stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature sustained under lyrical compression; metaphor networks (pigeons-dust-music) remain coherent under pressure. Any ellipses are pattern-taught early and land poignantly at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Zero loop, zero scaffold; prose is sinuous with adaptive rhythm—short breaths at crisis, elongated lines in reverie. Metaphoric load is purposeful, never ornamental; clarity never falters until the last charged image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes avian, archival, and cosmic tropes in an unexpected closed-lens story. Re-weighted meteorite and dust-mote return reconfigure earlier motifs; quiet endurance feels inventive at this length. No generic pigeon tropes survive.</comment>
