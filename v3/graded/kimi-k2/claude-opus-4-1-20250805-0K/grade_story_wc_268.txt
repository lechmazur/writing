<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Syln’s quiet endurance and gnarled-steady hands embody a lived-in contradiction: ancient power content to shelve books. Her micro-choice—dissolving the pellet—turns passive custodianship into decisive intervention, paying the cost of family fracture. Interiority stays tactile (“fingers…traced the words”) and avoids label-speak. The final “welcome home” crystallizes her stance without tidy redemption.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ink-shadow writes truth across the floor, stripping the pretender’s claim in front of the true heir. Causal chain holds—each message tightens stakes until Syln’s single pellet triggers irreversible exposure. Drift-stasis rule is taught early and never violated. Cost is visible: the pretender flees, the library’s secrecy breached forever.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crystalline dome and star-constellation clock anchor time and pressure; the library’s shelves become both weapon and witness. Iron-gall pellets and drifting rune are handled, not catalogued. Spatial choreography is clean—ink spreads, books open, footsteps echo. Environment constrains the final choice: only within this timeless archive can truth be unsealed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth of succession—signaled in the first margin note. Escalation is one long tightening: each message raises the cost of silence until the pretender breaches the drift. Agency rests with Syln’s decision to dissolve the pellet; the pretender’s flight is consequence, not rescue. Felt cost: the library’s inviolate isolation ends.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of custodial truth versus performative power emerges through ink, stone, and starlight—never stated. The pretender’s “calculated modesty” and Syln’s unadorned robes enact the contrast. Final image of the true heir arriving reframes millennia of quiet tending as active resistance. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the echo of “still maintaining dying truths.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, archival, faintly metallic with age—“iron gall,” “constellation pause,” “stone does not sing.” Syntax lengthens in calm, compresses under intrusion (“walls tremble”). POV stays locked to Syln; no head-hop. Dialogue minimal but textured: the pretender’s “Aunt Syln” drips false warmth against her spare replies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers knowledge, mood, and motion. No loops or scaffold; “ink that spread like living shadow” is precise, not purple. Rhythm modulates with stakes—long reflective cadences collapse into the staccato of breach. Clean mechanics; no typos or tense slips.</comment>

<comment>Reverses the titan trope: last survivor is a diminutive librarian, not a colossus. Drift-library as interdimensional archive feels inevitable, not gimmick. Fresh synthesis of genealogy, ink alchemy, and stellar timekeeping. Risky compression of centuries into constellation pauses pays off in the final freeze-frame.</comment>
