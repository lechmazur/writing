<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaine’s contradictory impulses—mechanical/new-moon vs organic/full-moon, rooted librarian vs mobile guardian—are dramatized in her titan-gear clicks and the choice to hand over the creel. The final image of her “mechanical heart beating in time with the tides” crystallizes an earned stasis that accepts perpetual flux. Interiority is specific, embodied, and avoids label-speak. Only the visitor’s chord-voice edges toward abstraction, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Kaine’s stance of serene acceptance reweights the premise that identity must be fixed. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned tide imagery and moon-phase cadence tighten until the final “eternal moment” crystallizes cost. Orientation is swift; causality holds. One hairline slip: the visitor’s smelting outcome is summarized rather than fully dramatized in-scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The tidal atrium’s glass walls, breathing with the ocean, function as both macro-setting and micro-constraint—Kaine’s gears respond to the same rhythm. The bamboo creel evolves from heirloom to crucible, its weight shift charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Only the “wintersun” phrase feels slightly ornamental, preventing 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserving wonder amid flux—is signaled early and tightened when Kaine must decide whether to surrender her grandfather’s creel. The moon-phase constraint and tidal clock escalate pressure under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in her creaking smile and perpetual vigil. Visitor’s agency is slightly offloaded to summary, keeping it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: identity as migratory constellation rather than fixed point. Subtext lives in gesture—the creel’s return “empty but heavier” and the gears’ tidal sync. Final image offers non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic drift; complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with tidal cadence and bronze-salt diction. POV stays locked to Kaine; perceptual signature is unmistakable in “salt-metal tang of change.” Compression is taught early and paid off. Minor convergence in visitor’s speech is allowable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; every sentence advances atmosphere or character. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with moon-phase tension. Only a single near-repeat (“this was enough—this eternal moment”) grazes redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of self-rewriting books and moon-phase embodiment feels inevitable yet fresh. Titan-gear librarian synthesizes steampunk and myth without gimmickry. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes and lands cleanly. Transformation test passed.</comment>
