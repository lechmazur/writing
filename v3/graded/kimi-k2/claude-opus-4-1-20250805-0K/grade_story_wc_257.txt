<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena’s grief-to-guide arc is embodied in micro-choices—folding cranes, sterilizing the needle, lighting the candle for the stranger—each action revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. The contradictory impulse to mark herself yet hesitate is dramatized in the stencil pressed to skin but not yet inked. Cost is visible: the house sold, the car slept in, the refusal to tattoo tonight. Secondary character pressure is light but sufficient; the stranger’s entrance crystallizes Elena’s new role without diluting interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elena leaves the un-inked stencil and a fresh crane on the bench, reconfiguring her stance from recipient to beacon. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each candle, crane, and visitor adds density until the final image reweights the stakes. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the line “subdued ardor for life was returning… refined by fire.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The observatory’s starlit dome and jeweler’s bench function as micro-settings that constrain choice: only star-time matters, tools are at hand, the open door policy shapes who enters. Sensory detail is selective—candle-glow, silver wire, vellum texture—filtered through Elena’s jeweler’s eye. The setting quietly guides the final gesture: another candle lit to summon the next lost soul.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transforming grief into usable guidance—tightens when Elena must decide whether to tattoo herself or fold another crane for the stranger. The single deepening beat (stranger’s arrival) forces Elena to externalize her craft, paying the cost of permanence deferred. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of alchemy-through-loss emerges from concrete acts: wedding ring becomes pendant, ash becomes ink, grief becomes coordinates. No moralizing; the phoenix stencil and cranes carry evolving meaning without authorial gloss. Final image of the glowing workshop offers a resonant, non-literal answer: transformation is communal, ongoing, and unpaid for tonight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, jeweler’s diction (“silver wire coiling,” “rice paper”) fused with astronomical cadence. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elena notices light, texture, posture of grief. No POV drift; dialogue minimal and subtextual. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, accelerating during the stranger’s entrance, breathing at the close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, dense, and propulsive; figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“curtains of intention”). No loops or scaffold. Sensory nouns and strong verbs carry weight; modifiers are rare and earned. Final paragraph achieves quiet cadence without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-workshop premise is transformed through the observatory refuge, origami coordinates, and jeweler’s precision. The synthesis feels inevitable: star-time, metalwork, and paper birds converge in a single luminous image. Specificity of craft and place anchors universals; no derivative echoes.</comment>
