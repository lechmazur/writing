<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her deliberate erratic steps and the embodied cost of inhaling weaponized memory crystallize her arc. The final renunciation (absorbing the plague) is earned by her seventeen-year preparation and the escalating stakes of each tier. Minor slip: “anguished joy” is named rather than dramatized in the closing dance, blunting the emotional knife-edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s unpatterned consciousness transmutes the plague into a new wisdom, foreclosing the archive’s original purpose. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each tier deepens density until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in her permanent cellular contamination and the guardians’ bewilderment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda’s twilight refractions actively constrain perception and movement; the crystalline walls and amber tubes are handled in multiple beats, charging the final emptying of the pagoda. Sensory selection narrows under crisis—stars dying on an unknown tongue—anchoring the Etherean collapse in Mira’s body.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent weaponized nostalgia from escaping—is signaled early and tightened tier by tier. The final absorption is a decisive trade-off that forecloses Mira’s prior anonymity and bodily integrity. Pressure escalates through density of memory rather than external reversals, consistent with the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: cultures end through incremental betrayals, yet individual chaos can seed redemption. The atoms of nostalgia reweight from treasure to warning without moralizing. Final image of Mira walking out “forever changed” offers non-literal resonance that reconfigures the archive’s meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is textured—saffron silk, dying light, impossible geometries—filtered through Mira’s perceptual urgency. Compression (“no, convulsing—no, transforming”) teaches the pattern of instability early and pays off in the final dance. No dialogue; internal monologue stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and conceptual weight without redundancy. Metaphors (“atoms of nostalgia,” “crystallize memories into physical matter”) are precise and internally consistent. Minor cadence repetition in “someone’s cherished memory, someone’s loss, someone’s moment” is offset by immediate visceral payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of memory-crystallization, behavioral-pattern evasion, and purification through self-sacrifice feels inevitable yet fresh. The Etherean archive trope is transformed by Mira’s unpatterned filter and the final transmutation of plague into wisdom. Risky lyric escalation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
