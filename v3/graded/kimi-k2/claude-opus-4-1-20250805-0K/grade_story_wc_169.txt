<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina’s interior conflict—hope versus the risk of dimensional dissolution—is vivid; her choice to teach others signals earned growth. Yet the contradictory pull of “I want grandmother back” vs “I must complete her work” is largely asserted rather than dramatized in scene. Emotional embodiment through posture and breath under pressure is missing, replaced by abstract declarations. Still, the character feels particular and her final stance carries credible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure: the final realization that grandmother has become “woven into the mathematics of hope” performs Conceptual Repricing—an on-page reweighting with felt price, satisfying the closure gate. Drive reads Accumulative/Textural: pattern intensifies until the lens image flips. Orientation is clear at paragraph one; no causality breaks. Micro-turn at needle spin lands. Only slight penalty for a summary-leaning climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Limestone grotto is etched with sensory grit—salt air, tide tongues, phosphorescence—and the lanterns’ Fibonacci spiral actually constrains Marina’s tactics when placed, not merely set dressing. However, it functions more as mood than active obstacle until the very end. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible positions. The gauge re-appears in final image, charging closure—just short of indispensable constraint for a 7.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake: restore multidimensional hope at personal risk of self-dissolution. Escalation proceeds via incremental pressure—each high tide shrinks safe margin. Meaningful turn when lantern array forces Marina to accept grandmother’s dispersed fate. On-page cost: “she would begin teaching others,” trading solitude for shared burden. Coincidence is used to complicate, not resolve. Stakes are visceral, not abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Theme emerges: hope as collective labor rather than retrieval. Motifs of measurement, tides, and equations re-weight silently into a closing prayer against loneliness. Subtext is served through choice, not assertion—except one near-theme echo (“equations for hope”) that grazes the banal. Ambiguity (grandmother is both mentor and ghost) deepens rather than tidies the question, holding uneasy poise. Emotional aftereffect lingers without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Lyrical compression—“crystalline face,” “salt air met stone”—is taught early and held consistently; no POV slippage. Perceptual signature through lens metaphor: light refracts, distances are gauged, not merely described. Tense and psychic distance stay stable. Brief internal monologue is focalized; no expository intrusion. Some poetic cadences could breathe more, risking slight density in peak sentences, but overall voice is singular and coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</question>
<comment>Cadence is elevated, occasionally tilting into ornate phrasing (“serene upheaval,” “crystallized final image”)—minor overwriting but beats propulsion remains intact. Few synonym loops; “light” and “equation” recur only when reweighted. One “watched how light bent” filter-verb stack; otherwise strong verbs and concrete nouns. Paragraph lengths modulate appropriately; no buried leads. Closure image lands clean—no text-artifact interference in final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</question>
<comment>The familiar “missing loved one” trope is inverted by treating dimensional travel as communal mathematics apprenticeship rather than rescue. Grandmother-as-constellation feels inevitable yet startling. Risk resides in quiet conceptual stakes rather than spectacle. Synthesis marries quantum mysticism to tactile grotto rituals, grounding abstraction in bodily labor—fresh, specific, memorable. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
