<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s motives—truth vs. isolation—are clear and embodied; the cog and journal physically test them. Interiority is specific (abrasive calm, “three years alone”). The final choice to descend is earned by prior agonizing and the woman’s pressure. Cost is felt: he surrenders solitary certainty for collaborative concealment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Marcus accepts the woman’s offer, reconfiguring his rebellion into hidden collaboration. Causal chain—cog → dispute → journal offer → descent—holds. Orientation is anchored early by sewer mouth, statues, water. One transition (sewer → deeper ruins) is allowed and coherent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Submerged plaza, barnacled statues, green water, and patched diving gear are vivid and selective. The sewer tunnel constrains movement and frames the encounter. The chronometer cog and waterproof journal function as micro-settings that shape choices. Final descent uses the ruin depth as literal and metaphorical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: preserve truth vs. propagate comforting lies. Escalation tightens when the woman reveals she already knows the truth and offers complicity. Marcus’s agency crystallizes in the decision to hide truth “properly,” with the cost of abandoning pure refusal. No coincidence resolves; pressure remains coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme—how history is constructed and who controls narrative—emerges from the cog dispute and the woman’s confession. Subtext in “time itself can have competing narratives” reframes the chronometer. Final descent implies future readers will unearth the hidden truth, a resonant non-moral answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is abrasive, precise, and philosophically inflected without drifting into lecture. Free indirect style stays inside Marcus’s skepticism. Dialogue carries subtext (“We know. But the world above isn’t ready”). Syntax tightens under pressure: short clauses mirror tunnel claustrophobia. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense (“barnacles creep across marble statues”). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors serve theme (“truth, like sediment, needed time”). Occasional elevated diction (“chronometer,” “sedimentary stratum”) fits Marcus’s self-taught scholar persona. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Post-plague sunken city as archive, chronometer cog as contested evidence, and collaborative concealment as rebellion feel fresh. The inversion—destroying technology to save the world—reweights familiar dystopia. Specificity of patched diving gear and waterproof journal grounds the concept. Risky choice to make complicity the “rebellion” pays off.</comment>
