<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority vivid and embodied; Emil’s grief-muted world is concrete through carpentered “sawdust drifted… shafts of light” and micro-choice to pocket the glass. The decisive change—song over silence—earns through causality: grandfather’s humming, cracked voice, felt cost (risk of being heard again). Internal contradiction (silence vs need to respond) kept alive through the fragment’s magnetic pull. Quiet persistence made procedural rather than declarative—each carved horse an accumulated promise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is resonant reconfiguration: fitting the halo fragment into the angel rewires Emil’s stance (silence→sound) with conceptual cost—he commits to living reopening. Causal chain: fragment found → guides to angel → fragment returned → causes glow → triggers song that reanimates ruin. Situational lens holds—impossibility of hidden garden is accepted under accumulated miracle logic, pressure crystallized in the moment song cracks.</comment>

<comment>Abandoned train cars deliver tactile grit: warped boards, rust, rain-dripping silence. Garden micro-setting (moss on painted flanks, water trickle) constrains action by being the only zone alive enough to receive the song. Atmosphere tightens stakes: fog as memory, “misting hush” as audible threshold between living and dead. Spatial anchors firm throughout.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—break silence or stay carved in grief—signaled early. Escalation accumulates: fragment discovered → discovery leads to garden → pressure to repair or flee finalizes when halo fits, forcing either song or refusal. Cost made visceral in voice’s rusted first crack. Garden’s living magic complicates causally, does not solve, and amplifies consequence rather than shortcuts.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges unstated through motif chain: broken halos → possibility → song in ruin. Silence as canvas vs absence interrogated through earned image set, final image of “train held its breath” offers non-moral resonance. Subtext in carving: each horse a memory refusing burial, now each will carry a note—renewal through imperfection.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Lyrical third-person close remains tight to Emil’s selective perception. Syntax coils like wood grain—“mist that refused to settle”—voice modulation under stress when cadence stretches into “held breath.” Consistent diction: no register slippage, no head-hopping. Compression purposeful: elision of circus backstory keeps garden reveal startling yet credible under dream logic pattern taught early.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Precision prose, few wasted words. Figurative language restrained until pivotal beat—“light spread like water, not harsh but whispering,” effective and earned. No loops; each line serves setting, mood, or character beat. Rhythm accelerates through final stanza to mirror song emergence. One minor near-abstract phrase, insufficient to dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Daring synthesis: magical realist garden inside rusted railcar not gimmick but crystallizes grief-repair theme fresh. Risk—fantastic reversal at climax—lands because groundwork laid in quiet carpentry miracles (living moss on painted horse). Specificity trumps generic: grandfather’s hymn, fragment’s size exact, garden’s circularity as unclosed circle ready for song. Transformation: mute carpenter becoming first instrument in his own ruined cathedral.</comment>
