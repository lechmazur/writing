<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kira’s interiority is vivid—floating above the stones, feeling the tablet’s impossible mass—yet the climactic “collapse/unite” choice is slightly under-motivated; the older Kira’s line is more thesis than lived pressure. Still, the embodied contradiction (refusing gravity vs. accepting weight) is dramatized and paid for when she finally touches ground.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: pressing the rune collapses timelines and costs the tablet itself. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each step thickens the pattern until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. The only hairline slip is the late appearance of the older Kira, but her function is legible and brief.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The viaduct’s procedural glow and the tablet’s impossible mass are not just scenery; they constrain every step and charge the final image when the bridge dissolves. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, anchoring the scene without clutter. The moss-light and shifting stones mirror Kira’s fracturing psyche, culminating in the darkening brightness that reconfigures meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—choosing which timelines to let die—escalates through the procedural bridge’s tightening iterations. Each step narrows options until the final collapse costs every alternate self. Pressure is coherent and felt; the price is the tablet’s dissolution and the irreversible singularity of one timeline.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: integration over escape, the cost of choosing one life. The tablet’s dust and the fading viaduct reweight earlier images without moralizing. The final grounded step offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the labyrinth of self.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates under pressure. Perceptual signature is strong—Kira notices through weight, light, and fracture. The single line of dialogue carries subtext and is tonally consistent. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. A few stacked metaphors (“shadows made of might-have-beens”) flirt with overwriting but serve the accumulative design. No loops, no scaffold, no clarity loss at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of quantum-fantasy tropes feels inevitable: the tablet as timeline-anchor, the viaduct as recursive psyche. Risky structure—lyric, non-linear—heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Specificity (bioluminescent moss feeding on rain) grounds the concept in sensory reality.</comment>
