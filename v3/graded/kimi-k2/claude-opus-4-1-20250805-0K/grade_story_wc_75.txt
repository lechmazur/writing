<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marta’s contradictory impulses—archival duty vs. the futility of rescue—play out in embodied micro-choices (trembling fingers, frantic tracing). The final renunciation of sleep to “work through the night” is earned by the accelerating thaw and carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marta’s stance crystallizes into “fierce tenderness of the archivist,” reweighting loss into legacy. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of rescued details tightens as the rosewater scent intensifies and walls begin to weep.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The grotto’s thawing ice, opera glass, and carbon-pressed initials constrain every choice; the lens literally enables sight and the weeping walls enforce urgency. Final image of Marta pressing the lens to stone charges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue of dying arts—tightens once as thaw accelerates pigment loss; the cost is the irreversible weeping that forces Marta’s all-night vigil. Agency is endurance under coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. erasure emerges from concrete particulars (initial-shaped loaves, emerald lens) without sermonizing. Final image of “loss into legacy” offers non-literal resonance that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Marta’s selective noticing (rosewater dread, emerald tint) and rhythmic compression (“she had perhaps hours, maybe less”) remain coherent under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“alphabet of belonging etched in carbon and flour dust”). Metaphors serve clarity; no figurative muddle in peak beats. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: displaced persons’ bread-initial archive + opera-glass forensic reading + grotto thaw as ticking clock. Risky compression pays off; transformation test fails if names/places swapped.</comment>
