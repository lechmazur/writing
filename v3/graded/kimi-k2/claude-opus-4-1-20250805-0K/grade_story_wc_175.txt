<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her tactile handling of the moth wing and deliberate knotting embody motive—but the “esoteric realist” label is never dramatized; her choices feel more ritualistic than analytical. The final renunciation (leaving the dissolving structures) carries felt cost yet lacks a prior contradiction to make the renunciation fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the monarch’s departure crystallizes Mira’s stance and the cost of impermanence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each fragile structure adds density until the spiral’s incompletion reweights the stake. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grotto’s moisture and perpetual dew actively dissolve Mira’s grass towers, forcing impermanence as a material constraint. Sensory detail is selective—filtered through Mira’s weathered fingers and biased perception—yet the setting never over-describes. The final image of bent stems and ghost dust recharges the place as memory itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring erased histories—tightens as each knot marks lost years and every dissolving tower forecloses permanence. Agency is renunciation: Mira chooses to let the structures melt, paying the price of invisibility. One clear escalation suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence as reverence emerges through gesture, never statement; the spiral without resolution embodies it. Subtext in the moth-wing dust and pollen records keeps the moral oblique yet resonant. Final image reweights the premise without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Mira’s tactile precision—“weathered fingers,” “blushing stillness”—with rhythmic control that breathes with scene tension. No POV drift; perceptual signature remains consistent. Compression like “unfinished sentences” for droplets teaches the pattern early and pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; each sentence layers image and motion. Occasional soft fillers—“even the water droplets seemed to pause”—are minor. No loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language is disciplined and purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of erased cloud-dweller civilization with monarch extinction feels inevitable and fresh; the moth-wing-as-archive concept is specific and non-obvious. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation test passes—names and places could not be swapped without loss.</comment>
