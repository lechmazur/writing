<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marlowe’s contradictory impulses—intellectual daring vs. tactical caution—are embodied in the mechanical arm’s clicks and the needle card’s tremble; her final “I’ll be waiting” crystallizes an earned stance with visible cost (foreclosure of open revolt). Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Only the Chancellor’s pressure is slightly under-dramatized, muting relationship crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the traced angles fuse card, sundial, and argument into a map of possible revolution, cost felt in the unspoken risk. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each coded phrase layers density until the final light-tracery reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Glass atrium and whispering brook are vivid yet selective; the mechanical arm and needle card act as micro-settings that constrain gesture and encode meaning. Light angles and water reflections mirror the intellectual fencing, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether coded dialogue can subvert dogmatism without bloodshed—is signaled early and tightens through each syllogistic thrust. The micro-turn arrives when “intellectual jazz” reframes destruction as creative improvisation, foreclosing violent revolution with conceptual cost. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: inquiry itself as destination. Subtext pulses in the arm’s whir, the card’s perforations, the sundial’s missing arc—no moralizing. Final image of the folded arm “keeping its secrets” offers resonant, non-literal answer to the question of revolutionary action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, lyrical, and POV-locked; perceptual signature filters every detail through Marlowe’s analytic yet yearning lens. Syntax modulates with intellectual intensity—long sentences for theory, clipped fragments under pressure. Dialogue carries subtext; no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, idea, and motion. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (light-trails, jazz) are coherent and payoff-earned. Occasional elevated diction (“epistemological doubt”) fits Marlowe’s academic register without drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: philosophical duel as covert jazz improvisation encoded in sundial angles. Mechanical arm and needle card transform familiar steampunk tropes into epistemic tools. Risky structure—argument as action—pays off with crystalline closure.</comment>
