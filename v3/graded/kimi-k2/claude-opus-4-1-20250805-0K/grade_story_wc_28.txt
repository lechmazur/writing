<question>1</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Reconciliation of mercy with steel arms arcs across all beats; however, final stance crystallizes with elegant economy rather than contradictory impulse collision. Slight emotional ventriloquism—‘a strange, cold warmth’—mildly undercuts authentic embodied experience at apex.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Closure unit delivers Conceptual Repricing: plaza mosaic etches “Sarai, the Gentle Radical,” reweighting destiny with undeniable social cost. Plot holds as Accumulative/Textural design; visions pattern-break and cadence-shift stakes rather than driving causal reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Objects—tessera, plaza, shattered sky—tether interior state to action; ‘warm despite the frost’ grounds contradiction. Yet environment never physically obstructs choices; micro-setting remains metaphor rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant mercy-vs-censure stake signaled early; escalating Brotherhood threat remains atmospheric rather than pressing. Closure reweights consequence through symbolic acceptance, but no mid-story obstruction or tactical forfeiture felt.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Thematic coherence emerges from tessera-by-tessera restoration metaphor; final carved name supplies resonant, non-declarative answer. Subtle risk of theme over-articulation—“mercy isn’t about purity”—leans toward label but stays within restraint.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose sustains lyrical, image-dense texture; ‘warm coldness’ modulates naturally. Compression like retrocognitive sequences taught by repetition, never clarity-dulling. Distinct internal voice stable under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Language precise, loop-free; few elevated diction slips—‘aberrant mercy’, ‘cradle empathy in arms of steel’ border on coined catchphrase yet remain readable. Rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: restoration-as-memory-reconciliation, curse as sacred invitation. Familiar post-apocalyptic plaza freshened by mosaic liturgy. Mild proximity to Chosen-One arc dulled by specific lived detail and earned mosaic inscription.</question>
