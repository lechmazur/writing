<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her grief is tactile in the pocketed chrysalis and loosened by foam observation. The contradiction between control (formulas) and acceptance (symphonic thinking) is dramatized in the final text to Elena. Micro-choice to release the chrysalis and send the text carries visible cost. One slip: “learning to think symphonically” edges toward label-speak, blunting the epiphany’s edge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the text “I’m learning to think symphonically” crystallizes a new stance with felt relational cost. Causal chain—foam insight → release chrysalis → send text → Elena’s reply—holds cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored by ravine edge within 120 words. No meaningful causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ravine, foam, and chrysalis function as micro-setting that constrains choice: foam patterns teach flexibility, chrysalis becomes the object to release. Sensory detail is selective—white foam, papery shell, iridescent wings—filtered through chemist’s eye. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift. Environment charges the final image without over-description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repairing the rupture with Elena—is signaled early. Escalation is a single deepening: foam teaches that separation can be syncopation, tightening Marina’s options to reach out or remain exiled. Cost is the six-month silence and the risk of further rejection. Agency drives every beat; coincidence merely decorates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: divergence as creative, not destructive force. Subtext lives in the empty chrysalis—absence that once held everything. Final image of braided streams singing “three voices becoming one” reweights prior material without moralizing. No thematic drift; complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is chemist-poet: “polymerized into distance,” “fugue in water and stone.” Syntax modulates with emotional crests—long lyrical lines collapse into the terse text. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly interior. Dialogue fragments feel authentic to SMS cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm breathes with beats—foam description elongates, text exchange tightens. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrase, but it does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of polymer science and musical form; monarch chrysalis repurposed as grief vessel. Risky lyric compression pays off in the braided-stream fugue. Specificity prevents trope drift; story would collapse if any element were genericized.</comment>
