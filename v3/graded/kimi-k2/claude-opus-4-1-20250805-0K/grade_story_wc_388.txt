<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s skeptical vocation and methodical reassembly of letters give him a sharp, consistent interiority; the final renunciation—burying truth to preserve sanctuary—carries visible moral cost and is fully earned by prior discoveries.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each discovery (letters → stillpoint → suppression) tightens Marcus’s options until the decisive act of re-burying the diamond; closure is a Charged Poise that reweights the entire premise with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glowing orchard, Geiger counter, and buried diamond are rendered with tactile specificity; the stillpoint bubble physically constrains Marcus’s final choice, charging the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. sanctuary—escalates as each letter raises the cost of disclosure; the final tightening forces Marcus to forfeit vindication to keep the orchard alive, with price legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the real curse is human choice, not radiation; the flawed diamond’s “broken heart” silently indicts utilitarian cruelty, resonating without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Marcus’s perceptual filter; diction is precise, rhythm modulates with tension, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; no loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift; every sentence advances discovery or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic orchard sustained by a flawed diamond is a fresh synthesis; the inversion of “curse” into suppressed salvation feels inevitable and specific to this world.</comment>
