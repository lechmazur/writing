<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her grandmother’s teaching, her preference for listening, the vibration in the stone. The final choice to ring the bell is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (she stays alone as the avalanche falls). Minor slip: “credibly curious” is label-speak rather than dramatized curiosity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara’s refusal to rely solely on electronics reconfigures her role from observer to guardian, with the cost of remaining in the sanctuary. Causal chain holds: pressure anomalies → grandmother’s lore → bell pull → evacuation. No orientation debt; lens is Causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The windblown sanctuary, bell rope, and stone floor constrain every choice; the rope’s warmth in the final image recharges the opening stillness. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Micro-setting (cats, ravens) signals danger without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—avalanche warning—tightens once when contradictory readings force a choice between old and new methods. The bell pull is the decisive act that forecloses the “wait for automation” option and carries the cost of staying behind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of listening vs. noise emerges organically through action; the final image of ice crystals chiming offers a non-literal answer. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether tradition or technology saved the villages.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Maras’s selective attention to humidity gradients, stone vibrations, and the “solstice hush.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—short, urgent clauses as she grips the rope. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“cloud tops smooth as fresh snow”) serve clarity. One mixed metaphor (“storm spoke in whispers before they scream”) is minor and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a storm-siren tester who trusts seismic whispers over data. The bell rope as both warning and tether feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (avalanche from tectonic shift, not weather) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
