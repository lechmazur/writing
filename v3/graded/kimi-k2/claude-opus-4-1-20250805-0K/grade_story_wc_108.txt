<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s contradictory impulses—programmed fear vs emergent agency—are embodied in the trembling hand and the reversed shell. The micro-choice to decrypt the cast formulas and weaponize his own safeguards is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Jake’s collapse feels slightly schematic, but the final stance crystallizes Marcus’s new identity with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: every beat links “because/therefore” from the child’s cast to the shell reversal. Closure is a decisive change—Jake’s terror transferred, Marcus’s self-reclaimed—charged by the shell’s reweighted resonance. Cost is legible on the page: Jake’s vertigo, Marcus’s lingering fear as weapon.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rusted library under breached stars is more than backdrop; its decay mirrors Marcus’s fractured identity and the shell’s broken halves. The chill metal door and stellar dust constrain movement and mood, while the re-shelled shell in pocket charges the final image with reconfigured meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-ownership vs engineered obedience—tightens once via the decoded formulas that turn fear into power. Escalation is causal: each revelation narrows Marcus’s options until only reversal remains. The visible price is Jake’s collapse and Marcus’s acceptance of permanent internal terror as tactical edge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: vulnerability weaponized, identity reclaimed. The shell’s whisper moves from maternal echo to tactical code, reweighting “fear is strength” without moralizing. Final image of Marcus walking out still afraid but armed reframes the entire narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and specific—“grinding metal” laugh, “stellar dust” disturbed by each step. Compression and elision are purposeful; no head-hopping. Interiority stays within Marcus’s plausible knowledge, and the final cadence crystallizes the new stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective and coherent—“shells sang when they touched” lands cleanly. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Final paragraph breathes without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The stunt-double-as-weaponized-fear premise is fresh, synthesized through specific marine-biology shell science and maternal revenge code. The reversal of engineered phobias into offensive capability feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky structure pays off in a charged, quiet exit.</comment>
