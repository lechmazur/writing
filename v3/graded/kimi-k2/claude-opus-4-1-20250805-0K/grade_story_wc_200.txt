<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her modest fearlessness shows in the “practiced steps” and the tactile warmth of the tooth. The micro-choice to hum off-key crystallizes her values and costs her composure, earning Thomas’s release. Yet Thomas’s arc is sketched more than dramatized; his shift from shame to laughter is asserted rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal lens holds: because Mara pursues Thomas, she elicits his confession; because she models flawed music, he integrates and dissolves. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration—Thomas’s laughter becomes light, and Mara’s tooth cools, signaling cost. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; only the gorge’s spatial layout remains lightly sketched, but it does not impair closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is rendered through sonic amplification—“footfalls became thunderclaps”—and the sunrise bronzing the wall, both constraining Mara’s timing and charging the final luminous image. The crocodile’s tooth functions as micro-setting, its heat guiding action. Selective sensory detail (harp’s bent strings, moisture in air) supports atmosphere without cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Mara free Thomas by turning his shame into acceptance? Pressure tightens when the harp’s broken melody resists correction; Mara’s off-key humming is the decisive act that forecloses Thomas’s stasis. Cost is felt in the tooth’s cooling and the faint lingering laughter—an earned release rather than coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: imperfection as beauty, sorrow married to joy. The final image of Thomas dissolving into “light too new for shadows” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the bride’s possible tears of beauty never confirmed—inviting reader reflection. No thematic drift; the harp’s discord and Mara’s laughter stay tethered to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation—“folded into itself until it sounded like weeping made of music.” Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara notices spectral temperature and sonic distortion. No head-hopping; interior monologue stays within her lexicon. Dialogue is sparse but natural—“Thomas, I’ve come to hear your confession”—carrying subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances image or choice. Figurative language is purposeful—“cathedral of gold”—and never muddles causality. Minor loop risk in “broken melody folded into itself” echoed later, but the cadence shift under pressure justifies it. No filter-verb stacks or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The lost-soul collector trope is refreshed by the crocodile-tooth compass and the integration of laughter as healing. Specificity—saint-swallowing crocodile, minor-key waltz—grounds the fantastical in lived detail. The synthesis of spectral confession with musical imperfection feels inevitable yet non-obvious. No derivative echoes; the final luminous ache is earned.</comment>
