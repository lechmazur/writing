<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her fingertip tingle, mossy laughter, and sudden air-reading all reveal contradictory impulses under pressure. The inherited gift and grandmother’s lesson are dramatized through micro-choices (stacking cairns, dissolving moon-speck) rather than exposition. The final transformation is earned and carries visible cost: her eyes “reflecting depths that hadn’t existed before.” Only the absence of a second on-page character prevents relationship crucible leverage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensification reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira stands “translator of the vertical world,” moss signature spreading, seeds harmonizing. Cost is legible in irreversible bodily change and the arbor’s creak of satisfaction. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arbor’s petrified bone-bridges, upward-falling leaves, and moss fractals are selective, sensory, and purposeful. Environment constrains choice: the skyborne altitude makes earth-leaves a message conduit and the moon-speck’s starlight bell audible. Final image of moss colonizing ash-gray bark recharges the setting itself. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—trees’ choice to ascend or return—is signaled early via folklore and tightened when leaf-letters spell warnings/promises. One decisive intensification: Mira’s prod of the speck triggers irreversible transformation, foreclosing her prior identity. Cost is visible in bodily alteration and the arbor’s claim on her. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of translation between earth and sky emerges from concrete particulars—seed cairns, leaf-letters, moss delight—never stated. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing: “each arrangement a tiny monument to things that must not be forgotten.” Ambiguity between warning and promise lingers, earned through Mira’s embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“hush where past meets prophecy,” “gravity’s rebellious children”). Perceptual signature is character-bound: Mira sorts by “size, shimmer, and song,” later reads air like scripture. No head-hopping; tense and psychic distance stable. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure—short pulses during transformation, longer cadences in reflection. Occasional elevated diction (“prodigal trees,” “vertical world”) remains within Mira’s mythic register. Zero artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—skyborne petrified arbor where seeds sing futures—is non-obvious and fully committed to. Folklore fragments (moon’s weeping, ascending trees) are synthesized through Mira’s specific inheritance. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Transformation test: story collapses if setting or moon-speck removed.</comment>
