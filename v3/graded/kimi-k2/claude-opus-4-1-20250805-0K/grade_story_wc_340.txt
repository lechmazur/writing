<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is specific and embodied—her gloved fingers, the warmth unfurling hidden ink—yet her contradictory impulses (duty vs. curiosity) remain mostly summary until the final beat. The moment she tucks the diary into her apron and smiles at the goggles crystallizes a credible shift from caretaker to inheritor, with the cost of abandoning the frozen-grief myth she’d half-believed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s new understanding that “tenderness survives” reweights every prior ascent. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each floor’s frost and gear-click layers density until the astrolabe reveal—while the final image (goggles warm against her palm) carries undeniable conceptual cost: she now bears Thorne’s encrypted joy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The spire’s narrowing walls, cracking ice, and amber bulbs are vivid and selective, filtering through Mira’s caretaker eye. The astrolabe and goggles function as micro-settings that constrain her final discovery; removing either would break the coordinate logic. Wind howling through gaps subtly mirrors her thawing interior state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Mira look properly?—tightens floor by floor until the diary’s first line forecloses her old detachment. Agency is present (she tilts the goggles, unwraps the journal), and the cost is felt: she must now carry forward Thorne’s encoded joy. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: frost patterns, star charts, and the final “sorrow shared becomes joy discovered.” No moralizing; the diary’s plain sentence reweights all prior grief without preaching. The ending’s quiet smile offers a non-literal answer—grief can be transmuted, not erased—leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, tactile, and slightly lyric: “ice cracking from cables like breaking bones.” Perceptual signature is servant-careful—she notices brass fixtures and dust patterns. No dialogue, yet internal monologue stays within her lexicon. Compression (“Tomorrow she would climb again”) is strategic and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense: “Through the scratched glass, she glimpsed something etched inside—tiny symbols that shouldn’t exist.” No loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Final paragraph’s cadence shift to quiet acceptance lands without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familiar gothic-spire and lost-captain tropes are transformed through Mira’s caretaker lens and the encryption conceit. The goggles-as-lantern device feels fresh; the grief-encoded-as-star-chart is a non-obvious synthesis. Specificity—“Cloud formation resembles Martha’s sleeping face”—anchors universals in lived detail.</comment>
