<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta’s curator identity is established early and her micro-choice to “follow where it led” drives the plot; Elena’s arc from silence to voice is embodied and credible. Interiority stays concrete, but the large supporting cast dilutes relationship crucible pressure. Final renunciation (Elena claims the courtyard as home) carries felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Elena reclaims voice and future address under a causal lens (“we hear you” triggers neighborhood mobilization). Orientation is swift; transitions from courtyard to shelter are legible. One meaningful tightening—letters found—reconfigures stakes with visible communal cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Courtyard, mailbox, and locket are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains action (mailbox lock, locket chain). Spatial choreography remains coherent; dawn light and neighbor rituals ground time. The courtyard reappears as Elena’s new address, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elena’s severed connection to Sofia—tightens when letters are located; communal agency, not coincidence, resolves it. One credible reversal: locked mailbox becomes source of reunion. Cost is communal labor and Elena’s public vulnerability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: listening as communal healing. Subtext in gestures (Elena’s trembling fingers, neighbors’ silent collaboration) avoids moralizing. Final courtyard image reweights “home” without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres to Marta’s perceptual signature; free indirect style is clean. Dialogue carries subtext (Jorge’s “sandstorm calm”). No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Sensory detail is selective (“tarnished silver,” “pounding until knuckles bled”). Rhythm accelerates during search montage, breathes at Elena’s reveal. Metaphors stay coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar premise—lost locket reunites families—is refreshed through thrift-store curator as listener-conduit and neighborhood collective agency. Specificity of courtyard culture and postal sleuthing feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
