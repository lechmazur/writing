<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera’s curiosity is embodied in tactile card-handling and micro-choices; her decision to confide the archive discovery shows motive escalation. Interiority is specific, though the emotional cost of sharing remains muted. Relationship pressure with Marcus is present but resolves too smoothly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the 43-day rhythm crystallizes the community’s persistence and reweights the crash’s meaning. Causal linkage holds—Vera’s mapping leads to the reveal—yet the felt cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight, onyx cards, and algorithmic tape create a textured micro-setting that constrains Vera’s ritual and charges the final image. Spatial anchors arrive early; the loft’s ghost data hum becomes an active participant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving digital culture—escalates from curiosity to proof of deliberate fragmentation. One meaningful tightening occurs when Vera reveals the archive, narrowing options for secrecy. Cost is implied but not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of networked resilience emerges organically from card patterns and diaspora rhythms. Final image of water finding new paths offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the grandmother lineage is elegant yet understated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is precise, sensorily dense, and consistent; “carbonized hard drives” and “ghost data singing” carry distinct texture. No POV drift; dialogue is spare and functional. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; sentences advance multiple jobs. Occasional elevated diction (“architects of a new kind of persistence”) risks register drift but stays within Vera’s academic lens. No loops or scaffold in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cartomancy, crypto archaeology, and diaspora mapping feels fresh and inevitable. Premise avoids template echoes; inherited mystery reframed through digital ruins is non-obvious. Risk-taking in form is coherent and rewarded.</comment>
