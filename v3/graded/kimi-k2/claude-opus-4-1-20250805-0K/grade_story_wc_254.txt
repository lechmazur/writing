<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“his breath visible in the atrium’s perpetual chill”), but the story leans on summary rather than dramatized contradiction; the final collective arrival feels externally orchestrated rather than earned by his specific flaw or choice, softening the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lake’s cracking and the poets’ collective stride reweight the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift drive the ending—yet the causality of the ban’s sudden lift remains off-page, a minor ellipsis that keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium and frozen lake are rendered with selective, sensory precision; the colonnade’s hum and the cracking ice constrain Silas’s choreography and charge the final image. Spatial anchors are clear early; only the glass wall’s exact placement could be tighter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—completing the forbidden dance—escalates through embodied pressure: each step dissolves another boundary. The tightening is visible when the lake cracks, foreclosing the old certainties. Cost is felt conceptually but not as a concrete forfeiture on Silas alone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of permeable boundaries emerges organically from Silas’s motion and the lake’s transformation; no explicit moralizing. The final image of “a sky full of doors” offers resonant, non-literal reweighting. A touch more ambiguity in Silas’s personal reckoning would deepen complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and perceptually specific—“living calligraphy,” “lantern-moth hush.” Patterned elision is taught early and paid off in the collective poem. No dialogue to test, but internal cadence modulates cleanly with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors are coherent and purposeful. Occasional elevated diction (“ephemeral verse,” “crystalline certainties”) flirts with register drift but stays within Silas’s aesthetic frame. No loops or scaffold detected; final third remains clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Cloud-shadow poetry as kinetic reality feels fresh; the premise synthesizes mysticism and performance art without cliché. The transformation of scripture-ice into a sky of doors is an earned, non-obvious reconfiguration. Risk-taking is coherent and heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
