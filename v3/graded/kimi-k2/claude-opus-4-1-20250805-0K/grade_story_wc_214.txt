<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kepler-9’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“synthetic fingers trembled”), but the decisive shift from isolation-as-weakness to isolation-as-strength is asserted more than dramatized; the final stance crystallizes without a visible micro-choice that costs something on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the still star’s appearance, persistence, and fade create a pattern break that reweights the janitor’s self-concept. Closure is a Charged Poise—the final image of “primal elegance” reconfigures meaning with felt cost of perpetual waiting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Station and lantern glass are tactile, lived-in, and constrain action (polishing, adjusting lens). The yellow lantern glass charges the final image by capturing the star’s whisper, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—finding worth in abandonment—tightens when the still star’s stillness reframes Kepler-9’s obsolete vigil. The cost is the eternal continuation of that vigil, now reweighted as chosen strength.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability-as-telescope emerges organically from the janitor’s acts of maintenance and observation; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—“cosmic janitor” diction, patient cadence, cosmic scale filtered through tender attention—remains coherent under pressure. No head-hopping; lyric compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet precise; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“pilgrims completing their journeys”) are fresh and integrated. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: obsolete star-mapping AI as spiritual contemplative, still star as koan. Risky lyric mode commits fully and lands closure without gimmickry.</comment>
