<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Martha’s interiority is embodied and specific—her fingers “retracing practice cuts” and her nightly solitary poem-trades show contradictory impulses of solitude and communal grief. The spectral grandfather functions as pressure rather than gimmick, forcing her to “feel for the grain” of grief. The final renunciation—accepting his absence once the stone is finished—carries visible cost in her solitary reading of the hidden poem. Only the brief “thundering calm” label keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the memorial’s ribbon unites seventeen families and Martha’s voice joins the “endless conversation” with the dead. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each carved name and nightly poem layers density until the final image reweights the premise. The monarch migration clock tightens the cadence without forcing false suspense. One micro-turn: the revealed poem hidden in the ribbon reconfigures the meaning of her inheritance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s iron bones and cooling glass constrain Martha’s work hours and echo the gravestone’s permanence. Monarchs clustering on milkweed provide a living clock that pressures completion. The ribbon roll itself becomes micro-setting when its hidden poem is discovered, charging the final image. Only the dusk light description edges toward postcard, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shape collective grief into one stone—signaled early and tightened by the migrating monarch deadline. Agency is renunciation: Martha gives up her grandfather’s guiding voice to finish the work alone. Cost is legible in her solitary reading of the poem to an empty greenhouse. Pressure escalates through Accumulative density rather than causal reversals, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of carving: grief migrates like monarchs, individual yet communal. The ribbon’s pattern literalizes the idea without sermonizing. Final image—words released “when the wind was right”—offers a non-literal answer to how shared sorrow becomes shared strength. No thematic echo in dialogue; all resonance is earned through image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in stone dust and milkweed scent. Perceptual signature is consistent: Martha notices texture, temperature, and the weight of names. Grandfather’s spectral voice retains its “thundering calm” timbre without slipping into cliché. Compression in the final paragraph is purposeful, taught by earlier nightly poem-trades.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic—“salmon sky,” “iron bones,” “grief has grain”—yet never purple. Each sentence advances image or stakes; no loops or scaffold. The final line’s “cupped hands” metaphor is precise and earned. Minor filter verbs (“she felt”) appear but do not cluster under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of gravestone craft, spectral mentorship, and monarch migration feels inevitable and fresh. The ribbon-as-pattern and poem-as-inheritance transform familiar grief tropes into lived ritual. Risk in the spectral voice pays off by shaping tactics, not explaining them. No close echoes of famous scenes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
