<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maya's survivor guilt and vocational identity are vivid through tactile detail and micro-choice; the child’s presence pressures a soft redefinition of purpose, yet the renunciation of “grand treaties” feels slightly generalized rather than dramatized as a felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (reweighting Maya’s “why I survived” stance) under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the linkage relies on poetic echo rather than strict because/therefore, yet the final shared coral hand-off crystallizes a social cost that prevents any tidy reset. Early orientation is clear by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Misted greenhouse, morphine haze, and the slow shift from dusk to manufactured rain all constrain sensorium and choice; the coral fragment itself grounds the final gesture toward shared endurance—setting is micro rather than panoramic yet fully functional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the translation of personal grief into meaningful connection; pressure rises through each added prayer on the cast, ultimately foreclosing Maya’s old professional identity with the act of literal inscription—“brave little warrior,” “dance again”—cost is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Emergent themes of survivorship, slow healing across languages, and communal art-making grow through embodied particulars; final coral and misted twilight offer a non-literal answer that reweights prior wounds without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Lush, precise imagery and measured rhythm stay within morphine-tinted perception; consistent modulation from clinical hush to prayer cadence, no POV leakage or register strain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Varied sentence modulation propels the beat; occasional lyric indulgence (“lotus-hearted ache”) is earned by context and does not clutter closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Takes the familiar “broken healers” trope and re-sites it in a Mariana Islands hospital greenhouse, using bilingual children’s graffiti as living text—an unexpected, grounded synthesis rather than ornamental novelty.</comment>
