<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marcus is sketched as grieving and “lately inspired,” but the interiority reads as poetic label-speak. The key moment—deciding to step chest-deep into the flood and play for the ghost—is under-motivated; no contradictory impulse inside him is dramatized, only declarative awe.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure happens: Marcus completes the unfinished note, Elisabetta’s ghost is released, and the program rewinds from ruined to intact. Cost is the program’s erasure, yet it feels more magical than earned on the page. The Causal lens holds—but the “because” linking water revelation to personal necessity lacks a felt chain of cause.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Opera house rendered evocatively—floating violin case, lantern reflections in black water—but spatial ground is sometimes vague (knee-, chest-deep at once). The flooded pit finally constrains the climax by forcing Marcus to stand where Elisabetta stood, nudging this just past postcard toward functional constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the resurrection of a lost note; pressure builds as the program dissolves, creating urgency. The single meaningful turn is Marcus physically entering the flood to finish the composition. Cost is implied—the water may claim him—but it’s only suggested, not dramatized as forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme centers on transmission across death, but it is voiced in lyrical gloss rather than dramatized choices. The ghost orchestra in the water’s reflection is beautiful yet symbolic comfort more than subtext. Final image reweights the opera house as a venue for immortal dialogue, giving quiet resonance without new emotional knowledge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Syntax maintains a dark-lyric pulse; voice is mostly internal, but occasional expository tags (“Marcus understood then…”) dilute immediacy. Description leans on romantic diction with minor loops of “flood” and “water.” Distinct, not generic, though compression slips at peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is fluid yet contains some recycled phrasing (“in-between space,” “lately inspired”) and stock cadences. Density is high, but small loops and metaphors (“program like algae threads”) appear for atmosphere rather than action. No clarity issues, but some scaffolding remains.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Premise of ghost code revealed by water damage is fresh; ghost orchestra is an original visual resolution. Tropes (haunted theater, drowned past) are familiar, yet the fusion of flood-photogram and music transcription gives a non-obvious synthesis, avoiding gimmickry.</comment>
