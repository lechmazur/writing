<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—cowardice versus reclaimed courage—is embodied in the pillbox and the scuffed snow; the final choice to “run toward” is earned by the Vienna flashback and Kestrel’s intel. Micro-choice: memorizing then erasing the map shows a hierarchy of values. The cost—leaving safety to rescue the colleague—feels scaled to the word count.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Kestrel’s arrival triggers the map, which triggers Elias’s decision; the closure beat (“turned his back…running toward”) is a decisive change with visible cost (abandoning anonymity). Orientation is clear within 120 words. No causality breaks; the pillbox’s earlier setup pays off as talisman.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mist-damp rock and softening snow function as micro-setting that erases evidence, directly constraining Elias’s decision to memorize then destroy the map. Sensory detail is selective—silver hush, crunch of old snow—filtered through a spy’s vigilance. Weather allies with secrecy, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeeming past failure by saving the colleague—is signaled early and tightened when Kestrel reveals “they think she’s the loose end.” One meaningful escalation: from passive guilt to active mission. Cost is legible in the choice to leave the bluff’s safety.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Theme of reclaiming abandoned courage emerges through action (memorizing map, scuffing snow) rather than statement. The pillbox reweights from gravestone to talisman without overt symbolism. Final image of “steady, measured pace” offers resonant non-verbal answer to the opening question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature—silver pillbox as mirror, wind as promise—remains consistent. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer reflective sentences collapse into terse dialogue. No head-hopping; Kestrel’s dialogue carries subtext (“I can only vouchsafe the location”).</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “ghost in the silver hush,” “fracture in their shared world.” No loops or scaffold; each line advances atmosphere or plot. Metaphors are precise (snow as canvas, initials as gravestone) and never muddle causality. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>The burned-spy trope is refreshed by the snow-cipher dead-drop and the pillbox-as-gravestone inversion. Specificity—Vienna alley, Pyrenees coordinates—grounds the premise. While familiar genre bones remain, the sensory execution and micro-choice architecture feel non-generic.</comment>
