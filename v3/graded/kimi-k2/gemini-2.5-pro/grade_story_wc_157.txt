<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s motivation is legible and consistent, but interiority is occasionally abstract (“spark of defiance”); embodied emotion peaks in the final beat. The gourd-seed choice crystallizes values with cost. Secondary pressure from Aris is brief but functional. No major contradictions, yet the charm-to-steel shift could be more textured.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: wilting sunflower → greenhouse → seed insertion → cognitive blackout. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (silence bought by possible wipe). Orientation is clear by ~90 words. One micro-turn (charm dropped for steel) tightens stakes. No causal gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Garden, greenhouse, and orchid are vividly sketched; the orchid’s neuro-electric field constrains the final choice. Sensory selection narrows under crisis. Spatial choreography is clean. A touch of white-room in the cityscape outside the glass, but micro-setting (seed, orchid) carries the weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting untaxable thought—escalates from passive surveillance to active probes. Seed insertion is a proactive, narrowing move with city-scale stakes and personal risk. Cost is legible: potential consciousness wipe. Pressure tightens in one continuous rise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of cognitive freedom emerges through action, not lecture. Subtext in floral code and silence resonates. Final image reweights earlier motifs (sunflower, gourd) without moralizing. A hairline drift toward abstraction in “spark” language keeps it from 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Kaelen; perceptual signature is consistent—botanical metaphors, tactical coolness. Rhythm modulates with tension. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual (“They’re learning to read the roots”). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and high-density. Occasional lyrical excess (“spectral orchid whose petals shimmered with an energy that wasn't entirely natural”) slightly dilutes peak clarity. No loops or scaffolding. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of biopunk resistance through botanic cryptography. Familiar dystopian tropes are re-wired via orchid neuro-electrics and gourd chronophage. Specificity of method feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
