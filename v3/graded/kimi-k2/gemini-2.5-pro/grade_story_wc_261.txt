<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between seeking closure and reopening wounds is dramatized in the tunneling beat. The final renunciation—“to carry them”—is earned by the preceding psychic cost and the ivy’s withdrawal. Minor slip: the phrase “final, perfect closure” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory memory and pattern of scar-reading tighten toward the Earned Stasis closure. The hourglass and ivy reweight meaning in the final image. No orientation debt; causality of memory-tunnel is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The tower, ivy, hourglass, and map form a micro-setting that constrains the ritual and charges the final image. Selective sensory detail (meteor hush, chemical scent) filters through Elias’s perceptual bias. Spatial choreography is coherent; no static filler.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Elias achieve closure via scar-reading?—is signaled early and tightens when the tunnel reveals the break was preserved, not erased. The cost is visceral: the ivy’s panic and Elias’s gasping withdrawal. One decisive intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the impossibility of final closure and the necessity of bearing witness. The hourglass’s unseen sand and the ivy’s regrowth reweight the premise without moralizing. Final image crystallizes ambiguity with felt cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature (chemical dawn, meteor hush) is character-bound. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during the tunnel collapse. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is purposeful and paid off (ivy’s “green pulse” vs. scar’s “puckered line”). No loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in “ghost of a chemical scent” but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: scar-reading as archival vocation, displaced miracle granting plant-telepathy, hourglass as unseen time. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off. Specificity prevents trope drift.</comment>
