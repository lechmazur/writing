<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Elian’s grim-optimist stance is embodied, not labeled; every choice (scratching proofs, choosing the die roll) stems from the same internal contradiction. Embodied regret (the asphalt smell, lock click) nails motivation. Only micro-gripe: lack of contradiction on the second roll—no flicker of doubt to sharpen the cost even further.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Closure obeys an Accumulative/Textural lens: density of proofs rises across the stairs until the paradox “chimes” into a CR that reweights the staircase from prison to canvas—felt regret is the visible cost. Causality is airtight; no missteps up to and through the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The staircase is the entire cosmos; its granularity (“gray stone of risers and treads”) doubles as mathematical surface. Environment constrains tactics—flint is only sharp against stone that is itself logic. Final shimmer makes setting the very fabric of price and possibility; no world-rule drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“he sought the texture”—escalates in micro-densifications of proof, each scratch adding pressure. The rolled seven is agency crystallised, forcing paradox; tension peaks at exact cost (the rupture smells of real rain). No secondary stakes dilute focus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of regret as recursion is emergent; no one states it. Final image flips the endless ascent into ‘infinite canvas’—a conceptual repricing without sermonising. Every motif (chipped die, stone proofs) answers the thematic question how memory can be made tactile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person intimate glints with Elian’s perceptual lens (“geometry of sameness”, “grim smile the uniform of his optimism”). Syntax curls with recursive elegance, modulating breath under rising density. No POV leaks, no head-hop; voice is consistent texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Prose breathes; sentence lengths rise and fall, matching ascent/stall rhythm. Zero repetition, zero flab. Each image does triple work (stone=proof=prison). Not a single looped phrase or filler descriptor to dull the chime at the rupture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade>
<comment>The infinite staircase as a math-space of regret is a fresh, specific synthesis. No obvious source texts; risk (math proofs as necromancy) is committed to without gimmick. Transformation test holds—swap names or places and the emotional engine collapses. Bold and coherent.</comment>
