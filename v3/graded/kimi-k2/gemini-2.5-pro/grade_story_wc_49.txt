<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's tinkerer identity is shown through embodied details (trembling vines vs. steady brass). Interior contradiction is present but light, and the restoration motive, while clear, feels stated more than dramatized until the final choice, holding it just under top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Causal arc is tight: humming → note shift → vine activation → golden tableau. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (stories remembered saturate the arbor). Cost is emotional memory absorbed, cleanly earned under Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Arbor's pre-dawn chill and leaf-lit roof guide Elian's hush; sensory filtering stays within tinkerer ear. Micro-setting (weathered central post) actively serves as conduit, not backdrop. Specificity occasionally drifts to ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is village renewal vs. fading rituals, signaled early. Escalation is one decisive vine-weave tableau, compressing the year's need into a single beat. Pressure feels earned but modest for elite stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete actions: song reviving memory, vine becoming story. Final image (hush full of memories) reframes the village’s relationship to ritual without sermonizing. Subtext quiet but cumulative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited blends tinkerer's perceptual signature (“brass-cog ear”) with lyrical rhythm. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hop. Occasional elevated phrases drift from POV lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, information-rich (vine growth in three clauses). No paraphrase loops; sensory specificity avoids purple diction. Rhythm accelerates with vine’s action, breathes at close. Clean copy save one cliché “luminous coin”.</comment>

<comment>Forgotten song as remedy is a fresh inversion of tinker trope. Golden tableau recharges motif without gimmickry. Feels inevitable but lacks bold risk to push to 9+.</comment>
