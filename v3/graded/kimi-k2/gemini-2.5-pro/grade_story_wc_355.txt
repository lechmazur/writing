<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s compulsion to capture silence feels deeply personal rather than a literary pose—his childhood memories seep in through the diary and calibrate every beat. Embodied interiority (“sun-warmed stone” memory) governs the micro-choice when he twists the dial past the safe numbers. The price is on the page: the unlocked diary remains unread, a small but tangible renunciation that costs him literal knowledge in exchange for shared silence. However, the internal contradiction of “taste colors” could have been intensified under final pressure to fully exploit the intuitively descriptive trait.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal pattern holds: memory triggers calibration → dial twist → clasp yields. Closure lands with Earned Stasis—silent pact kept without reading—paying visible cost in missed knowledge. Early orientation crisp: who, where, when clarified by “the town held its collective breath / final stillness before fireworks.” No narrative drift or retroactive patching.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Selective sensorium—ozone, velvet, brass—tightens with every rising firework thud outside. The small workshop as “micro-setting” literally confines the tuning, constraining the dial’s travel. Stars and fireworks are thematic backdrop rather than physical obstacle; thus constraint stops short of the 9+ gate but serves story without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can he preserve grandma’s loving silence amidst communal noise—signaled early. Escalation tightens when first firework load thuds: time window narrows, forcing intuitive leap. Cost legible on the page in the choice to not read; no reversals required. Stake never drifts into abstraction.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: silence as active, chosen love rather than absence. Final image of unread diary on shelf recasts earlier spectacle of fireworks—quiet survives within noise, no moral attached. Subtext avoids label-speak; silence itself communicates the “path to empathy.” Tidy but subtle.</comment>

<comment>Third-limited voice never slips. Perceptual signature (“taste of sharp, metallic anger”) stamps every sensory report. Diction stays in Elias’s eccentric artisan register—no drift. Rhythm rises with fireworks “deafening shriek” yet sustains quiet lucidity in closing sentence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, propulsive. Each clause layers meaning—copper wires, rising hums—without purple excess. One paraphrase loop (“precise aroma of potential / the precise aroma of potential”) is minor and early; it never recurs near closure, so capped at −0.2. Overall clarity and sentence-level craft are high.</comment>

<comment>Freshness lies in the conceit that silence itself is a recoverable, physical phenomenon—yet executed matter-of-factly, anchoring abstract in brass. Synthesizes familiar tropes (inherited diary, eccentric artisan) into a new emotional resonance. Risk: renouncing grandmother’s final words is bold—closure rests on omission, not revelation. Execution feels inevitable, not gimmick.</comment>
