<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Operator’s interiority is spare yet consistent: “precise and economical” motion, the hand on the cold press at the end. Motive—compress eternity—drives every micro-choice (uncorking, tracing frost). The final renunciation (perfect system lost) carries visible conceptual cost. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the library’s implosion of meaning reweights the premise on the page (“everything happened at once”). Causal chain—whisper → frost code → system overload—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the sparkling dust and new opaque buds. No orientation debt; pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass orchard, cloud sea, and frost-pane are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains the Operator’s method. The ruptured wall framing “swirling chaos” charges the final image. Micro-setting (letterpress, vial) doubles as tool and atmosphere. Environment meaningfully shapes tactics; only slight excess description keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberty of change versus static perfection—is signaled early and tightened once: the frost code overloads the system, foreclosing preservation. Agency is renunciation enacted through frost-tracing; cost is the library’s dissolution. Escalation is a single decisive intensification under Accumulative lens. Meets high-band gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence emerges from the Operator’s embodied choices rather than statement. The final image—open archway, pulsing buds—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: knowledge reborn as potential. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers. Integration with character goal is seamless.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is crystalline, restrained, and consistent with the Operator’s persona. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadence in description, clipped fragments at rupture. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct. Minor drift toward elevated diction in “crystalline trees” is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, dense, and propulsive; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence rhythm accelerates during rupture. One near-repeat (“rustling awakenings”) is pattern-taught and thus waived. Closure beat is unmarred.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—post-reality librarian uses frost-code to collapse eternity—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (library, apocalypse) are transformed through tactile specificity and conceptual rigor. Risk-taking (lyric rupture instead of explosion) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis is singular and memorable.</comment>
