<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory need to know vs. need to preserve ambiguity is embodied in the micro-choice not to re-read the smudge; the swallowed truth becomes the refusal itself, with visible cost in the “clean, high-altitude ache.” Interiority is specific, but the “fault-tolerant oracle” conceit is more label than lived trait, keeping it just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s refusal to collapse Liam’s waveform reconfigures her stance and carries felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of grief, light, and silence tightens until the final image reweights everything. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The weather station’s cold, barograph clicks, and ozone scent constrain movement and mood; the botanical illustration on the windowsill becomes the charged micro-setting that focuses the final light. Selective sensory detail mirrors Elara’s narrowed attention without tourist clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to resolve Liam’s fate—is signaled early and tightens once: the smudge forces the choice between knowledge and suspension. The deepening is her conscious renunciation, with the cost legible in the “atmosphere she now breathes.” Agency drives the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: ambiguity as an act of love and self-protection. The final image of the illustration in auroral light reweights the entire story without moralizing. Subtext resides in the smudge and the withheld word, not in exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, lyrical, and filtered through Elara’s scientific yet grieving mind—“auroral sorrow,” “oracular machine.” Syntax modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping. The diction stays within her plausible lexicon, though “fault-tolerant oracle” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence layers temperature, memory, and tool-sense. Occasional elevated phrasing (“auroral sorrow,” “indigestible stone”) flirts with overwriting but is earned by pattern and payoff. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with the scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The alpine ghost-flower quest and the smudged farewell note feel fresh because the emotional engine is Elara’s need for uncertainty, not the quest itself. Specificity of meteorological detail and the “Silene liamii” label root the trope in lived obsession. Minor risk in lyrical mode pays off.</comment>
