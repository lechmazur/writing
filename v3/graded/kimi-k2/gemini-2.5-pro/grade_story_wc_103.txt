<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s monastic drive and the embodied cost of memory-loss are vivid; the interior contradiction—clutching the fragment while fearing its erosion—grounds every beat. The final renunciation is earned because the maze’s geometry has been dramatized as his only lever. Missing: a second on-page character to test status, but the solo arc is complete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fragment dissolves, memory is erased, and the maze becomes a fresh unknown. Causality holds: hyperbolic geometry is set up early as a possible counterforce and is precisely activated at the climax. Cost is legible—“he felt no memories, no past, no name.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The living bridge and hornbeam leaves are not backdrop; their surfaces literally host the dissolving memories, forcing Elias to act. The yew at the center is the spatial and symbolic pivot where the final geometry is focused. Micro-setting (the fragment in pocket) constrains every tactical choice.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—stop the memory erosion—is signaled by the third sentence and tightens once: the maze must be weaponized against the fragment. Escalation is a single, deepening intensification rather than multiple reversals, but the cost (total self-erasure) is unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through action: the desire to “feel the texture of time” culminates in the tactile image of sandpaper grinding him to dust. The final blankness answers the thematic question without moralizing, letting the yew and empty paths resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, yet precise—“sepia tone ghosting at the edges,” “quaking reverie.” Syntax lengthens under memory’s dissolution, then snaps short in the void. No POV drift; every perception is Elias’s, filtered through his collapsing chronology.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. Occasional elevated diction (“non-Euclidean angles”) is justified by the POV’s vocation. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with the memory storm and final stillness.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of hyperbolic maze, retrocognitive erosion, and botanical memory-screen feels inevitable and fresh. Risky lyric compression pays off: the garden literally remembers for him until it doesn’t. No borrowed set-pieces; the premise is fully inhabited.</comment>
