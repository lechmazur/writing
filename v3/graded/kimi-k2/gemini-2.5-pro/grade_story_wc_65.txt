<comment>Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—his yearning for cultural survival against the dread of condemning the old ways—are dramatized in the micro-choice to lift the kingfisher quill. Embodied cost (the pulse in his ears) crystallizes his motive scale without lapse into therapy-speak. Drive deepens steadily to the decisive choice, validating Earned Stasis at closure.</comment>

<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The Causal lens is unbroken: every beat derives from the escalating need to weigh extinction against transformation. Closure unit arrives as “he lowered his hand”—a Charged Poise that reconfigures stakes, charging the final image with undeniable cost and foreclosing abstention. No orientation ambiguity or retroactive props mar the throughline.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Obsidian spire, frozen lake, and vellum act as micro-setting that cages choice: the reflective ice becomes a literal temperature constraint referenced by the sun-farm modeling, the spire’s altitude exposes the wind’s chill, the blank page is the irreversible frontier. Details are filtered through Kaelen’s perception bias rather than catalogued.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—collective survival versus cultural betrayal—escalates causally toward the point of no return. One decisive tightening arrives when the choice to mark the vellum becomes visible on the page, eliminating the option to wait. Cost is felt in the “slow thaw rather than a shattering flood” trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme (innovation as slow seed rather than miracle reversal) is embodied in sun-farms, new grains, pooled guild knowledge—never preached. The final motion of the quill is an earned, non-literal commitment that reweights earlier images of the frozen lake and kingfisher without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is character-specific, precise in diction, and rhythmically controlled through pressure. Compression and elevation are purposeful (e.g., “groundedly imaginative force”), and perceptual signature remains coherent. No head-hop or register drift under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is tight: high-density lines serve multiple functions (e.g., “a vast, unwritten page of white”), but a few elevated flourishes (“kingfisher promised life”) risk mild overwriting without muddling clarity. No paraphrase loops or template cadence under urgency. Clean mechanics except for minor adjectival clusters.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>“Ignorance cartographer” and predictive-engine governance are fresh angles on a survival plot; the slow-thaw adaptation model under extreme freeze is specific, not generic dystopia. No derivative echoes, risk-taking serves stakes without gimmickry. Core elements transformed rather than borrowed from template tropes.</comment>
