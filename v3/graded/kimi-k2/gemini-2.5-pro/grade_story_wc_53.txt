<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kael’s regret, embodied in visceral, contradictory micro-choices, drives every beat; the final integration with his ghost is an earned renunciation that visibly forecloses pride-driven denial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A clear causal spine: dropped camera → recovered memory → admission of fault → integration with ghost. Closure lands on-page with palpable cost under a Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Platform, mist, and carousel fragments are filtered through Kael’s sensory narrowing under pressure; the kinetic lagoon supplies immediate spatial threat and metaphoric reflection without ornamental excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes crest when Kael’s admission strips away his last self-protective narrative, tightening options to acceptance or disintegration; the pressure is coherent and intensifying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eroded ambition is not a theme label but an engine: each beat reveals the price of pride; the final image—pocketing the unrevealed film—offers a non-literal acceptance of that cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consistent interior monologue with tactile, idiosyncratic diction; no dialogue needed, voice remains singular and modulates under stress without ornament.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dense, rhythmic sentences advance scene and emotion; occasional lyrical compression is purposeful and paid off, with zero loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar post-catastrophe premise is transformed by the specific artifact (camera wheel) and the audacious goal—negotiating with one’s ghost—made inevitable through prior causality.</comment>
