<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s spiritual curiosity is embodied in her tactile handling of the camera and the breathing ritual; the contradiction between wanting to retrieve lost love and accepting its transformation is dramatized through the micro-choice of exhaling the memory. The final tear-blurred vision shows earned cost: she renounces possession of the love and accepts its diffusion. Interiority stays concrete—no diagnostic labels, only sensory metaphors tied to her craft. One minor slip: “pilgrim of sparks” leans toward label, not lived trait.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the image of drifting sparks reweights the premise—love is not stored but transmuted. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each breathing cycle intensifies the pattern until the final dissolution. Cost is visible in the “quiet resonance” that replaces the ache. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The jasmine-cluster micro-setting constrains the camera’s focus and becomes the literal source of the sparks; the cool floral air is breathed, tying environment to action. Twilight’s fading light is not mere backdrop but the medium the kwan yin’s tear refracts. Spatial choreography is clean: parapet, lens, cloth, glass plane. One generic phrase—“valley of mist”—could be sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate unused love—tightens through each breath cycle until the option of possession is foreclosed. The deepening is her shift from seeking a storage place to recognizing diffusion; cost is the ache transmuted, not erased. Agency resides in the controlled exhale that releases the memory. No external reversals needed; internal pressure suffices.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: love’s persistence as ambient light rather than private property. The jasmine sparks reconfigure the opening question without moralizing. Subtext lives in the inverted image and the tear’s refraction—no explicit thesis. Final image carries resonant ambiguity: beauty born of loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is tactile, artisanal: “camera obscura artist” is not a label but a perceptual filter—every sense is lens, aperture, light. Syntax modulates with breathing cadence; longer sentences on inhale, clipped fragments on exhale. No POV drift. Diction stays within Elara’s craft lexicon; “luminous ghost of reality” is earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “every vein on the jasmine petals was a river of light” does double descriptive and thematic work. Rhythm mirrors breath cycles without mechanical repetition. No mixed metaphors; “milky, water-worn quartz” is precise. One minor loop: “cool, floral air” and “coolness of the air” echo within three lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: camera obscura + bodhisattva tear + breathing ritual yields a non-obvious answer to a universal question. The inversion of the image literalizes the theme of love refracted outward. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final spark-cloud. Not derivative; the ritual mechanics feel invented yet inevitable.</comment>
