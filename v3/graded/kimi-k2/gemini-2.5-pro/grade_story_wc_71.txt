<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the orris-root pocket ritual and the hushed blaze conviction give her a distinct pulse. The final realization—that she is seeding questions, not sanctifying houses—earns its place through prior micro-choices and carries visible cost in her retreating “new lightness.” Minor slip: the phrase “inadvertently profound” is self-diagnosed rather than dramatized, blunting the contradiction that would push this to 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the white-cube man with the pink flamingo crystallizes the story’s reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Each displaced object functions as a pattern break that reweights the dominant stake; the final image of “a hushed blaze passing” is a Charged Poise with felt social cost. One causal hiccup: the overnight transformation of two neighbors feels slightly compressed, but the lyric cadence justifies the ellipsis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bay’s salt-heavy air and bruised-lavender dawn are filtered through Elara’s biased perception, guiding her route and mood. The white cube’s polished concrete stoop constrains her kneeling act, charging the final image. A touch more tactile interaction with the rock garden’s texture would have nudged this to 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reversing creeping sterility—is signaled early and tightened through each object displacement. The escalation is one sustained intensification rather than multiple reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens; the cost is the risk of exposure and the relinquishing of anonymity. Slight deduction for off-stage neighbor conversions that soften the felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the quiet insurgency of small, untidy life against curated perfection. The pink flamingo and riotous flowers reweight earlier motifs without moralizing. The final image of “one small, beautifully disruptive object at a time” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“streetlights daydreamed,” “shard of hush”—with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices scent gradients and curtain angles, not brand names. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; the free-indirect texture holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory detail and interior motion. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. One mixed moment—“obscene violation of the quiet” edges toward overwriting but is earned by character tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—guerrilla sanctification via displaced kitsch—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test passes: swap the bay for any suburb and the emotional engine collapses. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
