<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—chemical mantras, embodied discouragement, the tactile turn with the rag knot—but the final epiphany leans slightly abstract; the cost of “leaving the fortress” is named rather than dramatized, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer tightens the pattern until the wall resolves into a blueprint. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—hope redefined as pattern-making—with the rag knot as visible, felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fortress is rendered through moon-petals, blood-blossom moss, and the kerosene-scented rag; these details constrain Kael’s method and charge the final schematic. Micro-setting (rag knot) doubles as tool and key, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“defy the gravity of hopelessness”—is signaled early and tightened when the knot reframes perception. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is legible in the shift from passive listening to active creation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: hope is not found but composed from fragments. The mosaic wall and rag knot embody this without sermon; final image of the starless night as “canvas” reweights premise with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—pyrotechnic diction, rhythmic mantras, perceptual bias toward combustion and color. No head-hop; compression (“filter the stone from the bloom”) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pattern-building. One mixed metaphor (“gravity of hopelessness”) and a near-loop (“heavy hush… suffocating quiet”) keep it from 9+ perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: fireworks craft as epistemology, ruin as living schematic. Risky lyric structure holds; no derivative echoes. Transformation test fails if Kael were merely an alchemist—specificity of pyrotechnics is irreplaceable.</comment>
