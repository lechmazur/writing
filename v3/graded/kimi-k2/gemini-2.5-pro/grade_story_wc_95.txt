<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kaelen’s brass arm, wry patience, and habit of turning philosophical riddles into physical journeys are fully built into every micro-choice—especially the way he reads Elara’s sundial as a coded duel field. The slight deduction is for interior monologues that occasionally drift into polished essay rather than tension-charged interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The half-painted sundial lock, needle-card sequence, and shadow-timed rapier puzzle combine into an elegant Rube-Goldberg proof that lands on the page: the scroll evidence is a conceptual repricing whose mere presence reconfigures fate. Once inferred, the Causal lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The glass atrium, murmuring brook, and shifting gnomon shadow create micro-setting pressure—time literally shortens the candle, forcing tighter lunges. Color-loaded light reflections and marble angles consistently constrain stance and timing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Predetermined vs free-will stakes sharpen with every parry: the unpainted future hours narrow possibilities until the seam click forecloses unchosen paths. A visible cost (missed moves, gained evidence) locks the philosophical payoff to physical reality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The theme—turn questions into destinations—emerges not as aphorism but as live architecture; the sundial physically maps philosophical propositions into a journey scroll. The final image of the re-furled parchment finishes without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person-any pronouns stay anchored to Kaelen’s sensory compass: precise light angles heard by a metallic arm, obscured shadows lying like accusations. No POV leakage; rhythmic acceleration under fencing pressure is deliberate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, and information-dense: each rapier phrase a syllogism, every brass tick a metronome without ornamental clutter. One tiny loop—repeating “shadow’s edge moved” twice—bypasses the non-closure cap because rhythm serves tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes fencing duel, mechanical prosthesis, and marble clock into a fresh philosophical frame; the timed thrust hack feels inevitable in hindsight. Minor docking for a touch of generic “waiting as state of being” phrasing early on.</comment>
