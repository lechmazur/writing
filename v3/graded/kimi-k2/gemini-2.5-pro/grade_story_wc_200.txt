<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is vivid—his tactile use of the crocodile tooth anchors him in the living world—but the spirit’s shift from agony to laughter is slightly too smooth; a sharper contradiction in Silas’s own fear would have pushed this to 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gorge’s acoustics shift from discord to harmony, the spirit dissolves into sunlight, and Silas’s quiet satisfaction carries the cost of bearing others’ grief. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers sonic texture until the final cadence reweights the entire gorge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is no backdrop; its reverberant stone literally channels Silas’s descent and the spirit’s grief. The mist, canyon walls, and harp’s resonance constrain every move and charge the final harmonic image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the spirit’s wholeness—tightens through escalating sonic distortion that peaks in a painful shriek, then resolves into a single clear chime. The cost is the emotional toll on Silas, visible in the warming tooth against his chest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: joy is not the opposite of grief but its completion. The laughter memory reconfigures the spirit’s entire existence without a single explicit statement, achieving Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“luminous ache,” “spectral confession”—and the perceptual signature stays locked to Silas’s sensory filter. No head-hopping; every image is filtered through his midwife’s stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; only a single near-loop (“music…music”) in the tavern memory keeps it from 9. Metaphors are fresh and coherent, rhythm modulates with tension, and the final sentence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The “spiritual midwife” trope is inverted into a sonic exorcism; the harp’s broken strings become a literal map of grief. The synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious, and the risk of sentimental resolution is avoided through embodied cost.</comment>
