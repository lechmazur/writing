<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interior contradiction—empathy vs. annihilation of memory—is embodied in the tactile ritual; the cost (hollow ache, ghost departure) is felt. The Retro’s passivity limits relationship-as-crucible, but Kaelen’s micro-choice hierarchy is clear. Motivation stays rooted and intensifies to the renaming beat. One slip: “retrocognitively trapped” is label-speak mid-peak (−0.2).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: tessera insertion → energy channel → renaming → clean slate. Closure is a decisive change with visible cost (Kaelen’s thrum of absorbed pain). Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity. Mosaic-stone interface rule is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Crystalline-fractured sky and ash-tasting air are vivid, selective, and mirrored in the cracked stepping-stone that literally powers the act. The tessera’s lapis coolness constrains the ritual tempo. Spatial choreography is clean; plaza scale fits the intimate stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—end the Retro’s looping agony—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation tightens once: insertion of tessera narrows options to irreversible renaming. Cost is the Retro’s erased past and Kaelen’s accumulating psychic load. Agency is entirely Kaelen’s; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of mercy-through-erasure emerges from the act itself; no moralizing. Final image of Kaelen scanning the plaza reweights the premise: salvation is serial amnesia. Subtext in “warm coldness” holds. One soft echo: “memory is a tyrant” edges toward thesis-statement (−0.2).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kaelen’s selective perception; perceptual signature in metallic tenderness (“arms of steel”). Rhythm modulates with ritual intensity. No head-hop; dialogue minimal but voice-distinct. Filter verbs rare and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. “Warm coldness” and “ghost’s departure” are precise. One mixed metaphor—“cradle empathy in arms of steel”—skates close to cliché but earns its keep via repetition with cost (−0.1).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-erasure as mercy, delivered via broken mosaic circuitry. Premise commits fully; no retreat to safer healing tropes. The tessera’s reuse across beats and final retrieval crystallizes the concept. Risky ethical stance lands with felt cost.</comment>
