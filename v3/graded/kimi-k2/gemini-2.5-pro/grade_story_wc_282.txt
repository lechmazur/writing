<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses are dramatized through sensory mapping decisions that alter tactics under pressure; interiority is embodied and her final renunciation costs her physical anchoring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A clear causal linkage under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers emotional density until the violet awe crystallizes into a waveform, reconfiguring options with visible gravimetric cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The cave's mineral tang, voltage-laden air, and submerged archway are not wallpaper—the elm leaf anchor is physically used in the final beat to merge consciousness with stone, making the cave's specificity indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The violet awe intensifies��the pressure from curiosity to risk, forcing Elara to renounce observational safety and float mid-cavern; cost is embodied in the loss of gravity and rootedness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The unknown shifts from abstract goal to embodied reality in the cave’s consciousness; the waveform answer resists tidy moralizing and reweights prior sensory mapping with planetary scale cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice remains perceptually specific—Elara’s diction tightens under pressure, and her ossified lyric anchors without exposition; no head-hop despite consciousness merge because POV modulation is intentional and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold: each sentence advances discovery or atmosphere; figurative language is pattern-taught (elm as anchor) and paid off; gravity-free moment rendered in crisp sensory data.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Transitional-object premise is synthesized into cave-consciousness discovery; the shift from sensory map to planetary speaker feels inevitable; risk of human-voice loss charges the final waveform.</comment>
