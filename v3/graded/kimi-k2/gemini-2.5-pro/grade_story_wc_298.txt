<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is embodied and specific—soil-stained fingers, the “leering ghoul” on the card—but the contradiction between reckless idealism and fierce gentleness is asserted more than dramatized; the final choice to offer the memory is credible yet slightly under-costed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the burned card planted as guard-stone reweights the premise with felt cost (permanent loss of his sunlit future). Causal lens holds: each beat (offer memory → shadow recoils → root touches bone) links cleanly; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is vivid, selective, and functional: the phosphorescent moss, silver-barked sapling, and human femur constrain tactics (soil as medium for memory-transfer) and charge the final image (root touching bone). Spatial anchors are immediate; no white-room lapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—patching Elara’s soul-hole—is signaled early and tightened once: the shadow’s attack forces Aris to surrender his last bright memory. Cost is visible (loss of personal future) and alters tactics; escalation is causal and sufficient for 750 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of redemption-through-sacrifice emerges organically from action and image; the burned Sun card’s repurposing offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the gesture of “inlaying meaning” quietly reframes destiny as ongoing labor, not gift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked: “damp earth and old promises,” “slick, cloying voice” are character-specific. No head-hop; diction stays within Aris’s plausible lexicon. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors are coherent and scene-driven. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Minor elevated phrasing (“animate emptiness”) is voice-motivated and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: destiny-as-soil, memory-as-graft, tarot-card-as-ward feels inevitable yet non-obvious. The orchard-of-bones concept transforms familiar redemption arc into tactile ritual. Specificity anchors universals; no derivative drift.</comment>
