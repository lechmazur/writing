<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete and embodied—“soil and stone rather than ink”—and his contradictory impulses (realist resignation vs. reverent caretaker) act simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation—letting the last butterfly go without rescue—is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the dissolving structures. Minor slip: the phrase “quiet cadence finding its rhythm” edges toward therapeutic summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each woven lattice increases pattern density until the final spire crystallizes the cadence break. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s “soft place for it to land” reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. No causality breaks; orientation anchored by word 60.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The grotto’s impossible green and cloud-sea constrain every action—vines as material, precipice as limit. Micro-setting (moth wing between mica) functions as charged object that guides knot placement. Final image of structures “already dissolving” integrates setting into closure. One hairline slip: “blushing stillness” repeats without new inflection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring the last migration—tightens as each butterfly passes through an archway, foreclosing rescue. Agency is renunciation; the cost is the irreversible disappearance of both species and structures. Escalation is one deepening cadence shift under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: extinct moth wing + tattered monarch = erased symbiosis. Final image of “transiently rooted” sculptures dissolving offers non-literal answer to what remains after loss. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “indifferent sky.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><comment>Voice is distinct—“esoteric realist” perceptual signature filters every detail through soil-and-stone grammar. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences for stillness, clipped fragments as butterflies arrive. No head-hopping; diction stays within Elias’s lexicon. Lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, and information-dense: “filigree of dust and light” does triple work. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One mixed metaphor risk—“song stumbling into silence”—but context saves it. Final sentence lands clean.</comment>

<comment>Fresh synthesis: extinction elegy enacted as ephemeral architecture for non-human audience. Risky premise fully committed; no stock tropes. Transformation test fails if relocated—specificity of moth-wing map and knot grammar is irreplaceable. Quiet ending heightens stakes rather than retreating.</comment>
