<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—yearning for connection yet clinging to solitude—is embodied in the micro-choice to place the sundial and lean into the hum. The shift from “cage” to “reservoir” is earned by the stone-circle ordeal, with the cost of permanent solitude made legible in the final image. No stock phrasing; voice stays particular and embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrored floor’s parade reweights isolation into preservation. Causal chain—hum → immersion → acceptance—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; the cost is the unending stewardship of extinct memory. Orientation is taught early via “tidal library” and “atomically reflective floor.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The atomically reflective floor is not mere backdrop; it becomes the medium through which memory is negotiated and choice is constrained. Sensory detail is selective—mist, starlight, mirrored creatures—filtered through Kael’s grief-sharpened perception. Setting charges the final image, capping the score at 8.8 per gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform isolation into sustainable independence—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation occurs via the brittle awakening that threatens sanity; the tightening beat is the decision to coexist, which forecloses the option of forgetting. Cost is the eternal internal zoo of extinct life.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of coexistence with unchangeable loss emerges from concrete particulars: sundial, mirrored beasts, hum. No moralizing; the final image of “quiet kingdom built from echoes” offers non-literal resonance. Subtext operates in the silence of the creatures—no plea, just presence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (“breath hitched… cage of isolation slamming shut”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Kael’s scholarly, ghost-touched diction never wavers. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens appropriately at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and emotion without redundancy. No mixed metaphors or scaffold loops. The final paragraph’s cadence shift—short declaratives after long, winding lines—mirrors the crystallized acceptance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of extinct-species memory-keeper in a celestial library feels inevitable and fresh. Risky lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure. No derivative echoes; the premise is transformed through Kael’s specific grief and the charged sundial.</comment>
