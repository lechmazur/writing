<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; his cautious exuberance is palpable in the eclipse moment. Lena’s micro-choice—hand to earth—earns the shift from desperation to tender protection. The sixty-year grief is sketched with restraint yet felt. Only a slight therapy-register tinge in “nurture lifelong wonder” keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lena’s stance toward the curl is irrevocably altered under the eclipse’s charged poise. Causal linkage is tight—kalimba, eclipse, joined hands—each beat narrowing emotional options. Cost is visible in her tear-streaked surrender. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sage Ridge is evoked with spare, sensory precision; the “bruised twilight” and “ghostly ring of fire” charge the final image. The earth beneath their hands functions as micro-setting that constrains the ritual. No orientation drift. Could use one more tactile detail earlier to anchor place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Lena’s need to reframe loss—is signaled early and tightened once: the eclipse forces the choice to link memory to wonder. Agency is hers; Elias guides but does not decide. Cost is the relinquishing of sixty years of sorrow as sole identity. One clear escalation suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of wonder reclaimed from grief emerges organically from the eclipse ritual and the curl’s re-weighting. No moralizing; the final image of the corona answers the thematic question non-literally. Subtext in gesture and silence is rich. Minor risk of sentimentality is averted by concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, patient, musical—matching Elias’s vocation and the kalimba’s timbre. Perceptual signature is consistent; sensory hierarchy favors sound and light. No POV leakage. Rhythm modulates with eclipse tension. One near-cliché (“world held its breath”) barely grazes the finish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—“comma of spun gold” is precise. No loops or scaffold. One passive clause (“was being asked”) could be stronger, but it does not dull momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Eclipse-as-therapy is fresh without gimmickry; the ritual feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of the kalimba, the curl, and the sage ridge grounds the concept. Transformation test passes: swap any element and the emotional arc collapses. Slight risk of familiar grief-eclipse pairing is offset by execution.</comment>
