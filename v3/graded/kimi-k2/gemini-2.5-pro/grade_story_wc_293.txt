<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “luminous disbelief” is embodied in the trembling bow and the glass shard cutting his palm. Motivation crystallizes in the final paragraph: the leap from passive observer to active composer of possibility is earned by the vanishing and the mesh-code. Micro-choice (playing the flutter-rhythm) is on-page and costly—he abandons his old repertoire. Flaw is implied: lifelong acquiescence to “never,” now confronted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stance shifts from witness to seeker, cost is the irrevocable abandonment of his former songs. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mesh-flutters and shard-image accumulate until they reweight reality. Causality is lyric but legible: because Lyra vanished via the code, therefore Elias resolves to learn it. Orientation is anchored by word 30; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mountain pullout, resinous pine, ozone, and the distant bridge’s green mesh are filtered through Elias’s musician’s ear-eye. The scaffold wrap becomes a living score, constraining his bow-stroke choices. Micro-setting (glass shard) doubles as setting and talisman. Sensory selection narrows under pressure: only wind-pattern and shard-image matter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—Elias’s need to believe escape from “never” is possible—tightens when the mesh-code proves legible. One meaningful deepening: the random ripples resolve into syntax, forcing the choice to play them. Cost is explicit: he forsakes his bridge-songs. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; coincidence (Lyra’s timing) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme of transcending imposed limits emerges through concrete particulars: the shard, the mesh, the bow. Subtext in Elias’s silence while Lyra speaks—he listens like a tuner to pitch. Final image of the “question mark of impossible hope” reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic drift; ambiguity is purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked: “resinous scent of pine failing to mask the lingering ozone tang of a miracle.” Compression is taught early (“pixelated amnesty”) and paid off. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is musician-centric. Dialogue minimal but subtextual—Lyra’s poetic lines contrast with Elias’s internal counterpoint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: “a great bell had been struck and he was the only one left to hear its ringing fade.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is controlled; mixed metaphors avoided. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical lines collapse into staccato as he deciphers the mesh.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Premise of 19th-century collodion ghost trapped in corrupted digital file is fresh synthesis. Scaffold-wrap as cipher is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes; transformation test passed.</comment>
