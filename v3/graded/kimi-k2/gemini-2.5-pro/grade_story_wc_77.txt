<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“a sweetness that coated the back of my throat like a lie”), but the whispering advisor remains off-stage, so relationship crucible is moot. The void-as-flaw is dramatized through the final unbosoming and its tactical reversal, earning the closure with visible cost. No stock therapy-speak; contradictions play out in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the void redefined from weakness to weapon, Fear dissolved by its own taxonomy. Causal chain holds—notes lure, unbosoming triggers capture, clasp ignites dissolution—under a Causal lens. Cost is legible in the final image: “my curse now feeling less like a wound and more like a weapon.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Funhouse is textured and selective (“ghosts of sugar and rust,” “spectral light of a thousand terrified collisions”). The clasp and mirrors constrain the final choice; environment actively shapes tactics. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—trick Fear into revealing its weakness—is signaled early and tightened once via the unbosoming trap. Escalation is causal: each paradoxical note narrows options until the final reversal. Cost is the permanent void-anchor, felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of emptiness as power emerges from concrete events, never stated. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the mirrors’ dissolution and the advisor’s silence carries conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and POV-locked; perceptual signature is consistent (“photographically cursed soul,” “silken scrape”). Compression and elision are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure; final beat is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise of weaponized void against Fear feels fresh; tropes of haunted carnival and cursed return are transformed through specific, embodied choices. Risky inversion of weakness into gateway is fully earned.</comment>
