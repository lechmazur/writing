<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—yearning for the sacred while shackled to technomantic metrics—is embodied in the diagnostic failures and the decisive shedding of his pack. The final micro-choice (bare palm on stone) crystallizes a credible renunciation with visible cost: he forfeits institutional validation. Interiority is specific, but a touch of diagnostic self-awareness (“a poet forced to write legal code”) nudges it short of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the keystone reweights the premise—beauty without utility becomes the highest magic. Causal chain (diagnostics fail → pack dropped → resonance awakened) is tight, and the cost (abandoning sanctioned craft) is legible in the final image. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The spire’s “brilliant dimness” and skeletal garden anchor spatially and thematically; the keystone’s glow constrains the final choice by refusing quantification. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Environment directly shapes tactics—only after Kael relinquishes his tools does the spire accommodate impossibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Kael’s need to validate an unquantifiable magic—escalates through diagnostic failures and tightens when he must choose between sanctioned craft and felt resonance. One clear tightening beat (pack dropped) narrows options; cost is visible in the forfeiture of institutional power. Agency drives escalation under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the sacred is a way of seeing, not an object to master. Subtext resides in the keystone’s refusal to register on instruments. Final image reweights prior motifs (light without source) without moralizing. Complexity is preserved—automation remains dominant below, yet Kael’s stance is earned, not preachy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“brilliant dimness,” “bruised plum sky”) that modulates under pressure. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Compression (“mist walking… obsolete”) teaches archaic method early and pays off in isolation. Distinct perceptual signature sustained to the last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, dense, and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm accelerates during diagnostic failures, then exhales at the touch. One mixed metaphor (“bruised plum sky”) is minor and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: a technomancer who succeeds by abandoning metrics, in a world where automation has commodified wonder. The keystone’s “lingering luminance” reconfigures genre expectations without exposition. Specificity of mist walking and obsolete diagnostics makes the premise irreplaceable. Risk-taking (quiet, anti-climactic victory) heightens resonance.</comment>
