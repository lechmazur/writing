<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—grief vs. alchemical discipline—drives every beat; the embodied cost (sweat, drained energy) makes the final renunciation feel earned. The coin’s transformation is the visible price that forecloses resurrection, sealing his arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the coin’s golden seam crystallizes the shift from crushing loss to luminous regret. Causal linkage holds—each reagent choice and energy drain tightens toward the irreversible fracture—so the lens (Causal) remains intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rain-washed foundry’s heat, scent, and slag pedestal are not backdrop; they constrain Kael’s ritual and mirror his internal forge. The transformed coin becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“redeem memory without resurrection”—is signaled early and tightened by each reagent burn. The visible cost (his spent life-force) narrows options to a single irreversible act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges from the kintsugi metaphor enacted: broken memory made golden. The ending’s non-literal answer—“her name is light, not burden”—reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Voice is tactile, metallic, grief-tinged; perceptual signature stays consistent (“wet metal and quenched coal”). No head-hop; compression under stress is purposeful and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; sensory verbs advance stakes. Minor loop risk in “grief”/“regret” echoes, but they serve the alchemical color logic and do not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Familiar grief-ritual arc is refreshed by precise alchemical mechanics and the kintsugi metaphor made literal. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
