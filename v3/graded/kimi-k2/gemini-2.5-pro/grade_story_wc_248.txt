<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s contradictory impulses—arsonist’s rage vs curator’s tenderness—are embodied in micro-choices (torch vs brush) and crystallize in the final renunciation. The sister’s absence is rendered through tactile objects and pattern recognition, not exposition. One slip: “volcanic heat cooling into resolve” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tapestry lens reconfigures the vandalized canvas into Elara’s testament, foreclosing vengeance and opening curation. Causal chain—fragment → pattern → revelation → resolve—holds without gaps. Orientation is immediate; lens is Accumulative/Textural, held to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Archive is not backdrop; petrified paper scent and basalt walls constrain movement and supply pigments for the final act. The tapestry fragment functions as micro-setting, its weave literally projecting meaning. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rescue Elara’s erased voice—tightens when the slash is revealed as intentional canvas. One deepening beat: the light projection turns destruction into revelation, narrowing options from revenge to restoration. Cost is the permanent loss of anonymity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of erasure vs survival emerges through the vandalized portrait and tapestry key; no moralizing. The final image of the brush poised over canvas offers a resonant, non-literal answer: creation as defiance. Ambiguity lingers—will the world accept the truth?—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: tactile, artifact-oriented, with controlled lyric rises. “Dust-choked silence” and “quiet detonation” show perceptual signature. Compression is purposeful; no POV leakage. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High information density: each sentence advances discovery or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective (“volcanic heat” is earned). No loops or scaffold. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing”-adjacent phrasing, but clarity intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: arsonist turned curator in a necropolis archive, using fire’s opposite (light projection) to restore truth. Vandalism-as-canvas twist is unforeseen yet inevitable. Specificity of tapestry weave as lens key is non-obvious and integral.</comment>
