<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—grief braided into marrow—embodies motive and cost; her drumming micro-choices tighten the stake. The final Earned Stasis (lonely duet) forecloses reunion with visible emotional cost. Only a hairline slip: “haunting” edges diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: each tap layers density until the lagoon blooms, reconfiguring memory into shared artifact. Closure (Charged Poise) crystallizes the cost of irreversible solitude. Orientation anchors by line 3; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sound wave garden’s metallic flora and slab constrain every beat; the auric lagoon’s liquid light recharges the final image. Sensory hierarchy stays POV-bound—cool slab, star-pulse—guiding choice. Micro-setting (body-as-percussion) functions as setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—make the dream visible—tightens via escalating drumming that narrows options to one final performance. Pressure intensifies under Accumulative lens; no external coincidence resolves. Cost is the empty space beside her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love’s resistance to erasure emerges through concrete particulars: drumming grief into light. Final image reframes “auroral sorrow” without moralizing. Subtext in the silent duet offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric compression and rhythmic control mirror Elara’s percussive mind; no POV drift. Distinct perceptual signature—star-pulse, marrow-braid—persists under pressure. No dialogue; voice remains coherent and specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose pulses with sentence-level propulsion; each line advances image or emotion. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse, purposeful, and never muddles the closing lagoon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-entanglement as synesthetic haunting, grief transmuted into visible auric lagoon. Risky lyric mode commits fully; closure remains legible. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—specificity is integral.</comment>
