<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet, methodical interiority is vivid and consistent; the coral stamp becomes an embodied extension of his values. The final renunciation—to correct rather than expose—earns its cost through prior beats of careful observation and tactile discovery. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the “stolen heart” re-indexing reframes the city’s entire history with quiet but undeniable social cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory detail thickens until the moss-lit match crystallizes meaning. Causality is tight, no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sunken library is rendered through selective, pressure-filtered detail—dripping dome, salt-sealed drawers, phosphorescent moss—that directly constrains Elias’s reading posture and discovery. The coral stamp’s texture anchors the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover honest origin—is signaled early and tightened once: the blackout strips away official light, forcing a literal re-reading. The cost is the lifelong, solitary labor Elias accepts in the final beat. Agency drives every escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of erasure vs. reclamation emerges organically from the stamp’s ghost-impression and Elias’s quiet refusal to broadcast truth. The ending’s “reclaimed stillness” offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and slightly archaic without pastiche; perceptual signature is consistent (“tranquilly perceptive” filtering every noticed detail). No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during discovery, longer cadences in reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances atmosphere or action. No loops, no mixed metaphors. The moss-glow description is vivid without overwriting. Final paragraph achieves charged poise through syntactic balance and restraint.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The submerged archive, leviathan-hide tome, and coral stamp synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious whole; the blackout as invitation to truth is an elegant inversion. Risky quiet ending pays off with conceptual cost.</comment>
