<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s desire to claim a story of his own is embodied in the tactile choice to break the seal; the cost—accepting lifelong disbelief—lands on the final page. Interiority is specific (“tasted like a lie on the tongues of others”), and the micro-choice to open the door crystallizes his hierarchy of values. The flaw of inherited disbelief is confronted rather than cured, yielding an earned stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the moment the suspended tableau collapses, the narrator’s stance is fixed—he becomes the author of the very disbelief he was born into. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each descriptive layer (copperlight, salt, hush) tightens until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the last line: “the lighthouse will remember who set it free.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse’s rust, narrow door, and confessional lattice are not backdrop but instruments: the lattice is literally the viewport through which the impossible is witnessed, and the door’s seal-breaking is the decisive act. Sensory selection is urgent—salt air that “failed to erode certain sorrows” links setting to theme. Environment constrains the final choice and charges the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will the narrator seize a true story at the cost of credibility—tightens once: the discovery of the hovering bodies raises the price of revelation. The deepening is driven by his agency (he breaks the seal), and the visible cost is the collapse of the tableau and the impending arrival of disbelieving authorities.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges from the collision of inherited fiction and frozen fact: stories can murder time itself. The final image of the collapsed bodies offers a non-literal answer—truth is heavier than myth. No moral is stated; the lighthouse’s silent judgment suffices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and consistent: “copperlight repose,” “gray sea to the gray sky.” Compression and patterned elision (“thread this labyrinth with your own story”) are taught early and paid off at closure. Perceptual signature is distinct—salt, rust, and hush are filtered through a mind shaped by chronic disbelief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (“rusted iron needle stitching the gray sea”) are precise. Minor register elevation (“conceptual repricing” risk) is voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse-as-prison and frozen betrayal tableau feels inevitable yet fresh. The inherited cry-wolf stigma is transformed into the very mechanism that authenticates the narrator’s final isolation. Risky physics (suspended bodies) is committed to fully without retreat.</comment>
