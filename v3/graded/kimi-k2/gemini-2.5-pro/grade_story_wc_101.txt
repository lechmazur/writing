<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific (“hollowed cheeks,” “stooped shoulders”), her contradictory impulses (hunger vs suspicion, curiosity vs caution) play out in scene, and her final renunciation—choosing to plant rather than merely consume—carries visible communal cost. The bell’s recognition triggers a credible shift from survival to cultural stewardship. Minor slip: the phrase “gently persistent” is label-speak rather than dramatized trait.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s public vow at the arbor crystallizes a new communal stance with felt cost (labor, risk, hope). Causal chain—anonymous gifts → bell recognition → vow → seeds—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity. One tightening beat suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor, silver bell, and ridge micro-setting constrain every choice: the arbor is both delivery point and future garden site; the bell’s chime re-weights memory. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (“sliver of moon,” “wind whistled through the clay pillars”). No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival vs cultural continuity—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the bell forces Elara to choose planting over passive consumption. Escalation is one meaningful deepening under situational lens: anonymous gifts shift from sustenance to mandate. Cost is legible in communal labor and risk of failure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-resistance emerges organically from the bell, the elders’ stories, and the decision to plant. No moralizing; final image of “gentle scrape of hoes” reweights the amplified quiet without statement. Subtext in the donor’s silence and Elara’s unanswered bell-ring deepens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded, with rhythmic control (“monochrome of want,” “dog-eat-dog reality”). POV stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature filters every detail through her fatigue and wonder. No head-hopping or register drift. Compression in the final paragraph accelerates cadence to match communal energy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean, dense, and propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“ghosts…a frame for the bleak sky”). Strong verbs and concrete nouns dominate; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Familiar trope of anonymous benefactor is transformed through the bell’s specific provenance and the pivot from charity to cultural restoration. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of the five-petaled lily and terra-cotta arbor anchors universals. Quiet risk-taking in the open ending heightens resonance.</comment>
