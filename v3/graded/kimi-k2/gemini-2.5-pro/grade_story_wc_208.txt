<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her shift from artist to custodian is earned through micro-choices under pressure. The driftwood-as-language insight crystallizes her arc with visible cost—she is soaked, shivering, and her former purpose is foreclosed. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A. Flaw-driven struggle (learning vs. knowing) complicates the final stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of driftwood as “letters” reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds: each beat (find slide → project → diagram → build) tightens options until the wave’s force is channeled. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Cost is legible—“soaking and shivering,” “life’s work… remembering.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Storm-archway functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice: shelter, projector wall, and diagram surface. Driftwood and stones are tactile tools whose arrangement alters outcome. Sensory hierarchy (wind-hum, sea-spray, brass chill) filters through Elara’s sculptor’s eye. Final image of the archway “shuddering but held firm” charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survive the wave—signaled early and escalates via the slide’s revelation. One decisive tightening: the diagram forces Elara to act as custodian, not observer. Agency drives resolution; the bulwark’s pattern is her choice, paid for with soaked exhaustion. No coincidence resolves; the wave’s redirection is earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of re-remembering ancient alliances emerges from concrete action, never stated. The lantern slide’s layered meanings reconfigure Elara’s worldview without moralizing. Final image of driftwood as “letters in a language” offers non-literal resonance. Complexity-through-simplicity motif threads from motivation to closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is sculptor-specific: “gnarled burl of cypress,” “turbine-hum reverie.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long lyrical lines calm, staccato bursts during scramble. No dialogue, so naturalism N/A. POV remains tight third; no head-hop. Final cadence shift to quiet awe is earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or choice. Figurative language is selective (“star chart drawn by a ghost”) and paid off. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm mirrors storm surge then ebb. Clean mechanics; pronouns and tense stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-GPS world meets timewoven maritime covenant via magic-lantern cartography. Driftwood-as-language feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky compression (millennia in one slide) lands because pattern is taught early and closure reweights it. No derivative echoes.</comment>
