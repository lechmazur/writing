<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s compulsion to absolute honesty is embodied in the painful bartering for the eye and the final withheld truth; the micro-choice to press the relic to his temple crystallizes his hierarchy of values. The cost—three kilos of truffles and the quiet severance of memory—lands on the page. Interiority is concrete, never diagnostic. The ending’s earned stasis (he can now keep Lena private) is rooted in prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The causal lens holds: because the virus rewired him, therefore he isolates; because the storm peaks, therefore he attunes the eye; because the eye absorbs the truth, therefore he can answer “It is peaceful here” without spilling everything. Closure is a decisive change—he gains selective silence—paid for with season’s labor and psychic severance. Orientation is clear by line 3. No teleporting props or outline drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The hanging orchard, storm-lashed glass house, and ravine’s battered canopy are not postcard backdrops; the wind’s threat to tear blossoms mirrors Elias’s internal exposure, and the storm’s timing forces the attunement ritual. The glass eye itself becomes micro-setting, cool weight against skin. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Weather directly alters the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—psychological safety—tightens from abstract need to concrete silence when the relic’s attunement succeeds. One meaningful escalation: the storm peaks, forcing the occlusion act. Cost is visible—season’s truffles gone, memory cordoned off. Agency is Elias’s; coincidence only complicates (storm timing), never resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the price of absolute honesty versus the grace of chosen silence. The glass eye’s cerulean gaze reframes privacy as a cultivated truffle—rare, costly, worth the risk. Final image of the eye on the mantel reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the neighbor’s simple question and Elias’s withheld avalanche is sharp.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is that of a rational forager who notices fungal symbiosis and meteorite silicates. Syntax tightens under storm pressure: short clauses mimic wind-gusts. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Dialogue is minimal but natural—“It is peaceful here” carries subtext of enormous omission.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “precarious beauty constantly battered by storms” marries setting and psyche in one breath. No loops, no synonym churn. Metaphors (truffle as privacy) are precise and paid off. Rhythm modulates—long reflective sentences in lulls, clipped fragments as glass meets skin. Clean grammar, no scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The empathy-virus aftermath and psychic dampening via meteorite eye feel fresh, not trope-reliant. Combining mycology, fringe neurology, and meteorite lore creates a singular world. The final reconfiguration—silence as cultivated luxury—grows inevitably from established rules. Specificity (Tuber melanosporum, powdered silicates) grounds the conceit.</comment>
