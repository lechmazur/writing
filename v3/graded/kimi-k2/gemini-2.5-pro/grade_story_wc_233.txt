<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for escape vs duty—drives every beat; the final renunciation carries visible cost. Kael’s single intervention crystallizes her choice without stealing focus. One reflective block is anchored in present action and tilts her stance. No slips in motivation or knowledge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara refuses dissolution, foreclosing the grotto path with the cost of perpetual vigilance. Causal lens holds—each step “because” of her dream and the astrologer’s warning. Orientation is clear by 90 words. No teleporting props or plot amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mountain ridge, cobalt stone, and bleeding starlight constrain her final choice; the grotto’s light literally offers erasure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara’s disenchantment. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The setting recharges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape vs duty—tightens once when the light shows the price of forgetting. Agency is hers: she pulls her hand back and chooses descent. Cost is the lifelong burden of guarding others. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of sovereignty as burden emerges organically; the grotto’s promise of oblivion reframes the crown’s weight. Final image of standing guard offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in Kael’s single whisper carries fear and loyalty. No thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature is regal yet tactile (“silk of her gloves as a shroud”). Rhythm modulates with altitude and tension. No head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue minimal but subtext-rich.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is vivid yet lean; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentences accelerate on ascent, breathe at the grotto. Strong verbs (“silvered,” “bled,” “hummed”) replace modifiers. No artifacts in closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar quest arc is transformed through Elara’s specific refusal and the cosmic horror of starlight that dissolves identity. The ember grotto’s inversion—warmth as annihilation—feels fresh. Risk taken in quiet, interior climax pays off. No derivative echoes.</comment>
