<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is embodied and specific—shifting shale, pluming breath, tremoring fingers. The contradiction between his craving for routine and the wonder he finally accepts is dramatized in the sustained auroral beat. The earned renunciation of “jittery courier” identity carries visible cost: he now bears revelation, not just freight. Elara’s memory functions as pressure, not exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystalline garden and Kael’s still hands crystallize the new stance. Causal chain—pendant’s vibration → time dilation → vision → germination—holds without gaps. Cost is legible in the irreversible shift from courier to witness. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence tighten until the final image reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ridgeway’s shale, frigid air, and auroral river are filtered through Kael’s courier priorities. The pendant and crystalline growths act as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory selection narrows under stress; no static postcard. Environment evolves causally with the light-seed germination.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—carry wonder vs. stay safe—tightens when the pendant activates and forecloses the routine hand-off option. One meaningful deepening: the garden of frozen light forces a stance crystallization. Cost is the irreversible shift in identity. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between routine and myth, earned through Kael’s embodied experience. Final image of crystalline plants offers non-literal answer: wonder is cultivated, not delivered. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the cost of stepping into myth. Elara’s earlier maxim is reweighted, not repeated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual signature—shale under boots, hum against ribs. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadence for awe, clipped fragments for fear. No head-hopping; Elara’s memory is filtered through Kael’s gaze. Voice remains consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet textured: “shale shifted,” “plumed,” “gnawing anxiety.” No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or pressure. Figurative language is sparse and precise. Final crystalline garden is rendered with concrete nouns and strong verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Familiar courier trope is transformed through the auroral germination conceit. Pendant’s time-dilation attribute feels inevitable in hindsight, not bolted on. Specificity of “dragonfly-wing” and “moleskin pouch” anchors freshness. Risky lyric escalation pays off in the charged final image.</comment>
