<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “calloused palm,” the “hollow space” after the stranger vanishes—but the final renunciation (placing the flower on the shelf) is more gesture than crucible; the cost is felt yet not dramatized through a micro-choice that alters his next watch. Still, the borrowed-memory conceit gives his solitude a second skin, and the contradiction between duty and compulsion is sustained to the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the Edelweiss on the shelf crystallizes Silas’s new stance—he now keeps the stranger’s ghost for him. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each nightly holding of the flower layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the sentence “feeling the weight of one less ghost in the world.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The opal dock, salt-bleached piling, and lamp-room shelf are selective, tactile, and filtered through Silas’s keeper’s eye; the Edelweiss itself becomes micro-setting that constrains his final act. Mist and beam serve as rhythmic backdrop rather than active constraint, keeping the score just shy of the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the stranger’s gesture—tightens through nightly sessions with the flower; the deepening is the realization that the man came to drown his memory. The cost is Silas’s acceptance of shared grief, but the escalation is more accretive than sharply tested, limiting entry to the 8.8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of isolation as both refuge and wound emerges organically from Silas’s occupation and the stranger’s mirrored solitude. The final image of the lone monument in a tower of light offers a non-literal answer: witness is the only antidote to unwitnessed grief. No moralizing, only resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is salt-crusted, rhythmic, and perceptually specific—“wet, shifting colors of the opal dock,” “beam…a metronome for his thoughts.” Compression and patterned elision (“a man made of absences”) are taught early and paid off in the final cadence. No head-hopping; POV remains locked and confident.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical, with high information density—“the beam of the lighthouse cut its rhythmic path through the fog” does triple duty. One minor loop: “he felt the man’s departure not as an event, but as a sudden, hollow space” restates the same beat in adjacent clauses, a hairline slip that keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The borrowed-memory conceit fused with lighthouse solitude feels fresh; the Edelweiss-as-monument transforms a familiar alpine symbol into a private rite of surrender. Specificity of keeper’s life and the stranger’s “orbiting a single, frozen memory” create an inevitable yet non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
