<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-anchored promise and empirical intuition are embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing ants, holding the chip). The final renunciation—lowering the chip and walking away—earns its cost through prior causal beats and visibly unknotted grief. Interiority is specific, never diagnostic. Minor slip: “empirically intuitive” is stated once rather than dramatized throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the doorway dissolves and Elias turns back, reweighting all prior beats. Causal lens holds—each beat (ants → map → chip → arch) links by because/therefore logic. Cost is legible in the final breath that “finally unknotted something in his chest.” No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glowing cavern and rising creek constrain tactics and charge the final image; the creek’s roar is a literal clock sealing the entrance. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and woven through action. One minor redundancy: “blooming cavern at midsummer” is repeated almost verbatim.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fulfill Elara’s promise before the creek seals the fissure—tightens once when the doorway appears and Elias chooses not to enter. Escalation is causal and driven by his agency; the cost is the irrevocable acceptance of his single lived path. No extraneous reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the validity of the unchosen path is affirmed by refusing to enter it. The doorway as mirror, not exit, reweights every prior image without moralizing. Final image of “blooming shadows” offers resonant, non-literal closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is restrained, map-dealer precise, with rhythmic control under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices terrain, tools, and faint smells before emotions. No POV leakage or register drift. One near-cliché: “patience of a glacier” is the only stock phrase.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor filter verb (“seemed to warp”) is justified by POV uncertainty. Final cadence shift is earned and clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Ant-cartography as divination, a silicon chip as mystical key, and a grief-driven quest reframed as acceptance—each trope is transformed through specific, grounded detail. The synthesis feels inevitable; risk-taking (lyric cavern, conceptual doorway) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
