<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s color-blind painter identity is embodied in every perception; his “innocently cunning” trait drives the pivotal reed-tongue solution. Interiority is specific, embodied, and contradictory—he both reveres Vex’s color and cannot read it. The final choice to trade his sight for her skill crystallizes a visible cost: Lyra wakes, the moonflower opens, and Elian claims a wordless masterpiece. Minor slip: Vex’s interiority is filtered through Elian’s gaze, slightly softening her agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: because Elian sees pattern where Vex sees fire, therefore the plant-message is composed, therefore the resonator is built, therefore the note is offered. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lyra’s voice re-weights the courtyard’s silence and Elian’s self-definition. Cost is legible in the final image: “this was his masterpiece,” a renunciation of pigment for life. No orientation drift; anchors fixed by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The courtyard’s “shimmering failures and flawed beauty” is not backdrop but constraint: broken glass underfoot, kiln heat dictating tempo. The glass resonator itself becomes micro-setting, its “impossibly thin” walls a literal pressure vessel for the perfect sound. Moonflower unfurling under starlight charges the final image with earned poignancy. One minor spatial hiccup: cot location relative to kiln drifts between paragraphs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awaken Lyra—signaled in paragraph three. Escalation is causal: each beat narrows options from rumor → plant cipher → reed tongue → resonator → single note. The tightening choice is Elian’s decision to surrender his unique perceptual gift as currency. Cost is visible: the note fades, the moonflower opens, and Elian’s future canvases will remain forever grey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of beauty-in-imperfection emerges through concrete particulars: scarred world, cracked glass, flawed sleep, single imperfect note. No moralizing; the moonflower’s slow unfurling is the non-literal answer. Subtext lives in gesture—Vex’s soot-streaked tears, Elian’s breath across the hole. Final image reweights earlier greys into luminous white without a word of summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, tactile, synaesthetic in greyscale: “textures and tones that remained when such distractions were stripped away.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments during the kiln work. No head-hopping; Vex’s dialogue is spare, glass-worker idiom: “It’s impossible.” Distinct perceptual signature sustained to last line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, vivid, propulsive. Sentences carry dual freight: “a space of shimmering failures and flawed beauty” paints setting and stakes simultaneously. No loops or scaffold; each clause advances. One mixed metaphor—“palette for the years after the phoenix rises”—is brief and contextually earned. Final paragraph achieves crystalline clarity without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of color-blind painter, plant-cipher barter, and glass acoustics feels inevitable yet fresh. The single-note resonator as life-currency is a non-obvious synthesis that could not survive relocation. Risky compression—entire bargain condensed into moonflower response—pays off through charged specificity. No derivative echoes; the phoenix aftermath is backdrop, not plot device.</comment>
