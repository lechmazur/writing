<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “low tide” energy and bruised eyes anchor her cost. The shard and moonlight tie her flaw to the closure image. Kael’s motivation is dramatized through the condensation scene rather than summary. One micro-choice—angling the shard toward the moon—earns her Earned Stasis with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s stance crystallizes when the mist dissolves “sorry.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of regret increases until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is intact: evoke → condensation → recognition → shard to moon. Cost is legible in Elara’s spent sway and Kael’s silent weeping.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is not backdrop; its singing spirits supply the chorus that shapes the evocation. The stilt-hut’s humid pane and salt-drinking roots constrain the method (condensation) and charge the final image. Micro-setting—the shard on the sill catching first moonlight—functions as setting-object that constrains Elara’s recovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locate the moment before choice—is signaled early and tightened when the condensation scene forces Kael to confront the boat memory. Pressure escalates via Accumulative density: murmur → keening hymn → sigh. Cost is visible in Elara’s hollowed sway and Kael’s silent tears; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken apology emerges from the spirits’ song and the dissolving “sorry,” not from authorial statement. Subtext operates in the shard’s cold weight and the moon’s future knitting. Final image reweights the premise: silence is not absence but a space now filled with luminous truth. No moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“stones rubbing together underwater,” “unsent letter’s ink.” Perceptual signature is Elara’s: tidal, salt-heavy, moon-bound. Compression and patterned elision (“a surplus of fear”) are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with her exhaustion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective—no purple drift. Rhythm accelerates during evocation, then breathes at the end. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Final line crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory evoked through singing spirits and condensation messages feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Gargoyle shard and moon-healing are tropes transformed by tactile specificity. Risk in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
