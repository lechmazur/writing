<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning to preserve yet risking self-dissolution—are dramatized in the neural-lace sequence; the embodied cost (throbbing head, tear) seals the change. Interiority is concrete and helix-specific, but the “archeologist of abandoned dreams” tag edges toward label-speak, capping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (ozone, lavender, crimson-gold notes) tightens the stake of memory-loss until the final crystalline chord reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with unmistakable cost—she now carries the deaf composer’s sunset symphony, identity altered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canyon walls, moonlit ink, and repurposed salvage create a tactile micro-setting that constrains her isolation and frames the neural risk. The broken periscope mirror evolves from tool to portal to final reflective surface, charging the closing image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—personal erasure versus cultural preservation—tightens through escalating neural strain; the single decisive intensification is the cortex remapping that forecloses her former perceptual limits. Cost is visceral: “tremor in her soul.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory as living art emerges through the composer’s sunset symphony; no moralizing, only the charged poise of Elara’s tear. The final image reweights the “Great Theft” as secret, silent curation—resonant without didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinctively helix-minded: spiraling syntax, recursive imagery, sensory synesthesia. Compression and patterned elision (“maelstrom of entangled memories”) are taught early and paid off in the closing chord. No head-hopping; POV remains locked and confident.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language serves pressure without clutter. Minor cadence echoes (“her mind… her own… her breath”) nudge it below 9, but no loops or mixed metaphors mar the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The conceit of a periscope for time-memories is fresh; the deaf composer’s color-symphony feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (neural remapping as silent librarian) heightens stakes without gimmickry, fully integrated.</comment>
