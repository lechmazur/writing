<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Anya’s contradictory impulses—care for the past via photograph vs. care for the present plant—are embodied and felt in scene. Micro-actions (locked hand, spasmed fingers, eventual watering) reveal cost. The only minor dent is slight therapeutic phrasing around ‘somatic markers’; otherwise motive to action is clear and specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The piece uses an Accumulative/Textural lens: memory shards intensify inside a single moment until the final watering beat crystallizes stance. Closure is Earned Stasis—choosing to anchor to this living pine with visible cost (body thaw, photograph unremoved). Linkage is via escalation of sensory data, causal beats are sparse but cumulative image pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Seaside cliff arboretum is filtered through botanist’s care: glass walls, soft surf hum, scent of damp resin, grit of soil under thumbnail. These sensory cues constrain action—she cannot flee—and shape final image of fragile pine on a cliff. Constraint requirement met; only slight static reference to lighthouse keeps it just under 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake: how to remain anchored to optimism without denial of potential catastrophe. Pressure tightens via each heartbeat and distant drone. One intensification occurs at freeze paralysis; options narrow to enduring memory vs. tending life now. Cost is legible in bodily price of panic thaw, then choice to water the pine.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme grows out of particulars: living Wollemi fossils vs. crumpled photograph ghosts. There is no moral sermon only the weighted image: choosing water over relic, now over obliterated past. A resonant non-literal answer—hope is the act of continuing growth amid foreseen doom.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The sentence music varies; long lyrical sweeps mirror memory, clipped fragments map under adrenaline. Word choice is precise (‘stubborn leaf uncurl’, ‘soft as cloth’). A few over-ornaments (‘the sound of the sky tearing open’) are tolerable under pressure. Voice coheres and never head-hops.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Crisp information density; most sentences do two jobs. Two minor scaffold loops: ‘it meant nothing. It meant everything.’ and slight density pile ‘ice bloomed in stomach spreading outward.’ Otherwise rhythm and diction remain disciplined, driving closure.</comment>

<grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Rare synthesis: drone-strike PTSD in a conservation arborist setting, Wollemi pine as ancient survivor echoing personal trauma. Specificity of botanical labor grounds what could be generic memory. Risky quiet ending pays rather than announces. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
