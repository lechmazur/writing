<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory ache to “find where unused love is stored” drives every beat. The micro-choice to push deeper into Arthur’s memory crystallizes her stance and costs her breath, earning the closure. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. One hairline slip: “a strange and aching one” edges toward label-speak, but the embodied aftermath rescues it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the final image reweights the entire theater as vessel of stored love. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s realization that the love “becomes the soul of a place”—with felt cost in her breathless return to the grimy booth. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Causality intact under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The projection booth, theater seats, and dust motes are not backdrop but active absorbers of Arthur’s love; the final image recharges them as living archive. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Elara notices velvet and gilded arch because they literally store the emotion she seeks. One micro-slip: “cavernous, empty theater yawning” is slightly stock, but the specificity of “dust motes that danced eternally in the projector’s beam” compensates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“where unused love is stored”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by the discovery that the love suffuses the building itself. The deepening is Elara’s choice to follow the energy path into the theater’s fabric, narrowing her quest from search to witness. Cost is atmospheric rather than concrete, but the hushed thunder of silence now carries the weight of absorbed devotion, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: unspent devotion doesn’t vanish; it transubstantiates into place-memory. The final image of the theater breathing with stored love offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Arthur’s never-sent letters and Elara’s wordless inhalation at the end. No thematic echo in final paragraph—wisdom is earned, not stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is textured, tactile, and consistent: “dust tasted of rust and regret” sets the perceptual signature. Syntax modulates with pressure—long, breath-held sentences during the vision, clipped fragments on return. No dialogue, so mechanics waived. One minor filter-verb cluster (“she felt the weight of his pen”) but it serves the psychometric immersion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, texture, or light without redundancy. Metaphors are precise—“silence…a specific frequency of absence”—and never mixed. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. A single elevated phrase—“conceptual repricing” risk—but context justifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise reframes psychometry as architectural haunting; unused love as literal building material is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Arthur’s filmed letters and Elara’s discovery synthesize into a singular artistic stance. No close echoes; risk-taking (love as structural soul) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
