<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—dye-master perception refracted through a borrowed heart—and the final renunciation (to witness rather than solve) is earned. Yet the woman remains a luminous cipher; her only agency is to confirm the donor’s echo, so relationship pressure is minimal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sun-trail pattern intensifies until the morpho-wing reprise crystallizes meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—Kaelen’s stance reconfigured with quiet, conceptual cost: “a new way to see the light.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Floating tea-house, valley mists, and chalk-dust sun trails are tactile and selective; the wing-as-micro-setting constrains the final insight. Spatial anchors are clear by line 5; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the woman’s magnetism—tightens through accumulating light-pattern evidence. Cost is conceptual: Kaelen forfeits the need to possess the mystery, embracing witness instead. One clear deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of refraction versus absorption emerges organically from dye craft, wing optics, and light trails. Final image reweights premise without moralizing: “they are the prisms…” Resonant ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—color, refraction, valley mist—sustained throughout. Compression and lyric elision are taught early (“quietly explosive”) and paid off in the final cadence. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language serves pattern without clutter. Minor scaffold (“Stories clung to her…”) is offset by rhythmic variety and high information density. No artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—dye master with borrowed heart decoding story-magnetism via light trails—is fresh and specific. Transformation test: swap dye craft or wing and the entire resonance collapses. Risky lyric structure lands cleanly.</comment>
