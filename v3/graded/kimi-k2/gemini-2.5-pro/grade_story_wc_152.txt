<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (listening vs. acting) coexist in scene. The final choice—risking exposure to transmit the map—carries visible cost in the hush after the green glyph. One slip: the “foolish disguise” is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (General’s rehearsal, blackout test, embroidery encoding) tightens options until the three-minute window. Closure lands on-page with the green glyph and the charged poise of resumed stitching—cost felt in the observatory’s heavier silence. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is sketched with selective sensory detail (cold in bones, dome’s low groan) and constrains choice: the eternal candle’s light enables secret work, the telescope’s calibration window enables transmission. Micro-setting (black silk, auxiliary terminal) functions as charged objects.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing the coup—escalates through each overheard fragment; the final tightening is the three-minute sync window that forces the irreversible transmission. Cost is the new silence and the risk of discovery. Agency remains with Elara throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of unheard stories emerges from concrete particulars: embroidery as code, silence as evidence. Final image of the eternal flame reflected in “ancient, knowing eyes” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the altered star-chart is never explained, only shown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, tactile, and biased to Elara’s textile perception (“ghost-stitch,” “threaded a needle in the dark”). Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during transmission, longer cadences in reflection. No POV leakage; diction stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“ghost-stitch,” “cloak of foolishness”). No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: spy-thriller encoded in embroidery, cosmic scale filtered through textile intimacy. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight; no stock tropes. Risky compression of tech detail into tactile metaphor pays off without clarity loss.</comment>
