<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kavi’s conservation ethic is embodied in every gesture; the final sweeping away of dust is a perfect, wordless renunciation that costs him his life’s work yet leaves him fulfilled. Interiority is spare but precise—“empirically ironic” captures his self-aware contradiction. No secondary characters dilute focus; the palace itself becomes a silent antagonist. The earned stasis—keeping the star-cloud secret—carries visible emotional price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the moment the tile locks into place, the sky reconfigures and Kavi’s stance crystallizes—he gains knowledge at the cost of ever sharing it. Causality is tight: tile → schematic → sky → silence. Orientation is immediate (ziggurat, twilight, interregnum). No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural pattern of thrift → expenditure → revelation holds to the final breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The glazed-brick ziggurat, obsidian dust, and violet sky are tactile constraints: every grain swept back into its pot signals Kavi’s frugality. The palace-as-tomb metaphor is vivid but never ornamental; it tightens his isolation. Sensory hierarchy is astronomer-precise: starlight thickens, chalk-water arcs. Final image of the hidden nursery charges the setting with cosmic scale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—seal a covenant with the unknown—tightens as planetary alignment narrows to a single dusk. Escalation is one deepening: the schematic’s completion forecloses any further attempt; the cost is the irreversible secrecy. No reversals needed; the tension is the risk of cosmic indifference. Agency is absolute: Kavi’s meticulous placement of the tile triggers the sky’s answer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inverse alchemy of hoarding versus spending: conservation spent in a single act creates immeasurable wealth. Subtext is carried by objects—dust, tile, star-cloud—never stated. The final silence is a resonant, non-moral answer to the question of what knowledge is worth. No thematic drift; every image reweights the premise of value.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is astronomer-ascetic: precise, frugal, quietly awestruck. Syntax mirrors motion—long spiraling sentences for the ziggurat climb, clipped sweeps for the dismantling. No dialogue needed; the narrative hum suffices. Perceptual signature is star-filtered: “starlight seemed to thicken” is a scientist’s metaphor made mystic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet aerodynamic; every noun earns orbit—“gossamer structure of iridescent gas.” No loops or scaffold; redundancy is banished like wasted dust. Rhythm modulates with tension—hushed setup, resonant hum, quiet dismantling. Figurative language is disciplined; no mixed metaphors disturb the cosmic logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Fusion of Babylonian astronomy, magic-square mysticism, and cosmic revelation feels inevitable yet fresh. The trope of hidden star nursery is transformed by mathematical devotion rather than prophecy. Specificity of cuneiform numerals and chalk-water arcs roots the wonder. Risky quiet ending pays off: silence itself becomes the covenant.</comment>
