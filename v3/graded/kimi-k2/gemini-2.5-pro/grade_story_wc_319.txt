<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyel’s contradictory impulses—yearning for home vs. duty to the garden—are embodied in the pendant’s temptation and the final refusal. The interiorized ache is specific and non-generic, and the renunciation carries visible cost: he seals the portal with his own longing. Minor slip: “dimensionally homesick” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lyel forecloses the path home, reconfiguring the garden’s silence into a new purpose. Causal chain—pendant contact → portal tear → refusal—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the final image: “the ache…remained, a familiar companion.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Frozen roses, weeping statues, and mist are filtered through Lyel’s perceptual bias; the garden’s cold constrains his final choice by becoming the very skin he refuses to shed. Micro-setting (pendant, library doors) doubles as tool and boundary. One minor drift: “impossible cerulean sky” risks generic contrast.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guardianship vs. return—is signaled early and tightened when the portal opens. Escalation is one decisive intensification: the tear forces a choice with felt cost. Agency remains with Lyel; coincidence (cultists elsewhere) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of making peace with uncertainty emerges from concrete particulars: the pendant’s false certainty vs. the garden’s honest fog. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: “he was waiting to see what the morning would bring.” Subtext in gesture—pouring longing into the pendant—carries conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is feral, compressed, lyric; perceptual signature sharp (“ice in his own veins,” “clean, sorrowful hum”). Patterned elision taught early (“he did not remember names”) and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language disciplined to one or two per beat. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance multiple jobs. Minor register lift in “dimensionally homesick” is the only artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: guardian who has metabolized his prison into identity, refusing escape because escape would be betrayal. The inversion of homesickness as sustaining warmth is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
