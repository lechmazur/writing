<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—embodied dread, tactile handling of the fragment, and the micro-choice to invert gain anchor her arc. The “find the beginning in every ending” motive is dramatized through her three discarded assumptions, each paid for with rising system strain. Cost is felt in the tower’s groan and the near-overload of her console, making her final smile earned. Flaw: the mentor echo is summary, not embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the silence that is “full of latent potential” reweights the premise and forecloses the old listening paradigm. Causal chain—perigee → overload → fragment tuning → null-point—holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in the crackling pressure and the tower’s groan.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The tower, gorge wind, and cosmic dust are filtered through Elara’s professional bias; every detail (steel skeleton, rotted cables, “serenely electric” air) constrains her choices and charges the final silence. Spatial choreography is clean; the fragment’s cradle is tracked. Micro-setting (the fragment itself) becomes the tuning fork that shapes the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture the shard of hush—tightens as lunar perigee amplifies chaos. Escalation is one deepening: from “chaotic waterfall” to “perfect, structured null-point,” driven by her agency to invert gain. Cost is the system’s near-failure and the tower’s audible strain. No coincidence resolves; the silence is earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: endings are generative silences, not absences. The Hollywood fragment—once “too loud”—becomes the key to hush, reweighting its meaning. Final image of the city “waiting” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic drift; every motif (dust, towers, star-death) loops into the closing silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with technical diction (“galactic collision,” “null-point”) that stays within Elara’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long sentences under calm, clipped fragments under overload. No POV leakage; perception is filtered through her sensory priorities. The prose itself “tunes” like the fragment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences are dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective (“swollen pearl,” “coiled spring of reality”) and never muddles causality. No loops or scaffold; each line advances stakes or atmosphere. Minor elevated diction (“serenely electric”) is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The shard-of-hush concept is a fresh synthesis of SETI tropes and poetic silence. The fragment’s repurposing from “loud novelty” to “anti-noise key” transforms a cliché into inevitability. Risky inversion of gain is taught early and paid off. Specificity (Black-Lip Gorge, Hollywood star) grounds the cosmic in the local.</comment>
