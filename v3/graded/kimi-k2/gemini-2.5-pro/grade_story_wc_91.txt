<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s curiosity is embodied in the tactile walk and the deliberate release of light; the final kneel and palm-to-sand moment crystallizes a felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the “philanthropist of moments” line edges toward label-speak, blunting the contradiction needed for 9+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (shell, glyphs, fireflies, steam) tightens the pattern until the final image reweights the premise. Closure lands with unmistakable cost—the mountain’s new heartbeat under Kael’s hand—earned by the detour and release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Black glass sand, basalt circle, and glowing steam are not backdrop; they constrain Kael’s path and mirror the final pulse. The conch shell and tidal pool act as micro-settings that steer choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—understanding transformation—escalates through accumulating textures rather than reversals; the release of light tightens the pattern and incurs the cost of empty bottles and altered mountain. One clear intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of accidental prophecy and quiet transformation emerges through concrete particulars; the final image of steady heartbeat beneath the sand offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture—“salt-stung clothes,” “verdant luminescence”—remains consistent; perceptual signature is selective and character-bound. No head-hop; compression is taught early and paid off in the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Minor scaffold in “profound curiosity about the nature of change” could trim, but no artifact touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: destitute philanthropist, volcanic beach, bottled lightning bugs, and accidental prophecy interlock organically. The quiet, luminous closure feels inevitable yet non-obvious, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
