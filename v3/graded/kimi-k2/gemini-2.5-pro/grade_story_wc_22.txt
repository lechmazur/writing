<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Coachman’s quiet atonement is embodied in seed-by-seed choices; interior contradiction between resignation and micro-striving is invited but not enacted on the page, so the final renunciation (tomorrow’s return) feels credibly poised rather than tested. Emotion is sensuous and grounded; “quiet atonement” tell pulled back by tactile ritual. Earned through steady choices rather than visible flaw clash, limiting band entry for top-tier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accum/Textural—cadence of planting tightens descriptive density into resonant reconfiguration. Closure on “lighten satchel, paint jetty with life” provides conceptual cost (garden on gravestone) without causal pivot linking prior flaw to consequence. Quiet escalation satisfies 600-word frame; lacked a housing beat that proves concord’s narrowed hope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Jetty stones, chemiluminescent flora, dead-reef smell constrain pacing and seed selection; sensory hierarchy alive without clutter. Micro-setting (crack of silt-pocket) is made choice-limiting. Minor seep of scenic tourism in “pardoned” sunset description, but setting ultimately enforces the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grow life in memory of loss—signaled early and tightened through bird-guided seed placement; pressure widens from impossibility to incremental first-biome sublimation. Agency remains steady without daring reversal or measurable price beyond fatigue, gliding short of 8.8 dissipation threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of hush between obliteration and promise emerges from tactile specifics—seed pockets, salt tide, outdated birdsong. Final image of “garden on gravestone” circles the stakes without preaching. Avoids final-paragraph moralizing; a touch of explanatory gloss on “submerged concord” leaks thematic air.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Arc of dusk registers in diction and dampened rhythm; free-indirect pressure is coherent. Macro register of elevated lyric suits grieving ceremony, though occasional formulaic cadences (“stone finger pointing into the corpse”) risk notice. Under Q9 lens, birds being early lecturers rather than voices in scene weakens full occupancy of POV compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose has deliberate clotted beauty—metaphor layering flowers over salt death; few instances of near-duplicates (“his fingers working the soil into the stone” pairs closely with repetitive emphasis). Clean otherwise, but density of images in late beat slightly dulls final image urgency. No prose artifacts reach closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Premise—war-at-sea as ecological amnesia converted to memory horticulture—fresh because grounded in specific seed taxonomy and bird-mentor mechanic. Synthesis feels inevitable; the risk of lyric mourning avoids cliché. Highest band entry denied only because seed-bird coupling could still appear in another landscape.</comment>
