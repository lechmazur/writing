<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias operates clearly from the palate-as-memory conceit; every snip is a motivated beat tied to his vocation. Interiority is vivid yet avoids clichés—his tongue tasting betrayal and apathy feels lived-in. Micro-choice hierarchy culminates in the trembling leaf-taste of hope, an earned shift with a felt cost (no reversal; earned stasis). Some smoothing in early exposition keeps it just shy of the 9.0 gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Causal lens holds cleanly: twin-moon trigger → frantic growth → pruning → re-seasoned fruit. Each beat tightens options toward the final taste. Closure is a Charged Poise in the greenhouse tableau—hope palpable, cost still hanging. Seamless causality with only minor orienting drag at the very first sentence (“stood inside the skeletal remains” could tighten).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse, broken panes, drifting moon-twin light: concrete, micro-setting that constrains every step and cut. The pot and salvaged earth remain tactile tools; the synaptic-plant functions as living setting. Atmosphere breathes decayed grandeur and imminent bloom—yet never overwhelms the surgical urgency. Enough specificity to pass the ≥7 gate but lacks literal wall constraint to carry it to 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Dominant stake—“re-season the history the plant carries”—is signaled early and escalates by every synapse-prune beat. Stakes intensify as memories taste like poison; the celestial window is a real countdown that forces each cut. Costs appear in sensory nausea and irreversible loss of sour branches. Agency and cost align cleanly under the Causal drive toward resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Theme—reshaping inherited trauma without erasure—is woven through image and action, not stated. The final flavor becomes a resonant answer: hope distilled, not moralized. Subtext carries in the quiet, tactile final line: Elias “knew his work had just begun.” Earned wisdom without therapeutic sermon. Just misses the extra edge of moral risk to push higher.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Interior culinary register is stable, sensory-dense, and rhythmic—“he tasted betrayal… cloying compliance.” Compression and purposeful elision taught early (“instead of mere flavors”) and legible at closure. No POV drift; psychic distance modulates with pressure. Only a few elevated diction patches border on register drift just outside excellence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Syntactic variety, strong verbs, no looped scaffolding. One near-paraphrase (“coaxing the plant… sculpting a mind”) lightly redundant but does not obscure closure. Metaphor stack stays coherent. A sentence-long descriptive stall right before climax (about libraries burning) slightly thins momentum. Clean, publish-ready prose with microscopic slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>The memory-taste tree grafted onto synaptic-pruning is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Celestial alignment and culinary synesthesia are not gimmicks; they reshape an ancestral trope. Synthesis feels inevitable once the seed sprouts bitterness. Specificity prevents drift into allegory; each synaptic snip is grounded in sensory detail. Satisfies high 9 band through execution and integration.</comment>
