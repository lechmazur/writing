<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (preserve family honor vs. record betrayal) play out in micro-choices. The final lie is earned by prior failures and carries visible social cost. Minor slip: “curiously steadfast” is stated rather than dramatized until the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each attempt (chaos, appeal, bribe) tightens options until the lie becomes inevitable. Closure lands on-page—Eva discards the fob, Silas is ruined—cost is the permanent recording of betrayal and Elara’s exile into shadow. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rotting pier, brine, kelp glow, and brass recorder are selective and POV-filtered. The recorder’s cold weight and final warmth bookend the arc, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clean; no static cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent betrayal via the fob—is signaled early and escalates through three failed tactics. The final lie narrows Silas’s options to zero; Eva’s disgust is the visible price. Pressure is coherent and protagonist-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of trust as currency emerges through action: the fob’s traded loyalty, the recorder’s captured betrayal. Final image of dawn bleeding through cracks reweights the premise—trust broken cannot be un-recorded. No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is salty, tactile, and consistent; perceptual signature favors metallic tastes and damp sounds. Compression is purposeful—“ghost in homespun,” “landed fish.” Dialogue carries subtext; Silas’s cracked denial is pitch-perfect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances goal or atmosphere. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—“mouth opening and closing like a landed fish.” Final line lands with cadence shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar pirate-market frame is refreshed by the recorder-as-currency conceit and the lie-as-weapon tactic. Specificity of the flawed serpent scale feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky choice to hinge climax on a fabricated detail pays off.</comment>
