<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority stays fused to pulse and physical action; her micro-choices—syncing heartbeat to bow—earn the final reawakening. Fear and hope layer credibly; no diagnostic self-speak. Slight slippage toward lyrical abstraction in final lines keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain from shell pickup to climactic uprooting holds; every beat narrows options until vines reclaim statues. Closure—nature overgrows mechanism—lands on page with overt, felt cost. No orientation gaps under lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Orchard, sky-bridge staircase, Wardens, Mother Tree all constrain tactics; tools (violin, locust shell) double as micro-setting. Sensory precision and spatial coherence charge final image of moss-covered granite. Tiny drift into poetic distance only.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“reawaken beauty” vs rigid control—tightens on each beat until vines overtake statues. Protagonist agency drives escalation: shell placement, violin signal, uproot. Visible price: exhaustion and personal expenditure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of organic reclamation grows from specific acts; metaphor of nature absorbing sterile order emerges without sermon. Final image reweights premise; no tidy moral summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Third-person free-indirect texture remains taut and character-colored; perceptual signature consistent. Elevated lyrical register is purposeful and teaches its pattern early. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Rhythmic propulsion, dense information, zero cliché or scaffold. Metaphors “apple blossoms the color of old bruises” and moss-covered granite crystallize without overwriting. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar reclaim-nature-from-clockwork trope gains fresh skin via heartbeat-as-score and locust-shell key. Risk choice—using literal pulse—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
