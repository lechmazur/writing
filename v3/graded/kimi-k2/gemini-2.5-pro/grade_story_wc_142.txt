<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s contradictory impulses—anarchic love vs. tactical order—are dramatized in the graffiti plan and the final squeeze of the stone; the cost of compromise is felt in his “frantic drum” heart. Interiority is concrete, not diagnostic. Secondary pressure from Zola is brief but functional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Kael hasn’t stopped the Consortium but has rewritten the story they’ll read; the cost is the irreversible shift from pure chaos to encoded order. Causal chain (because desperation → therefore graffiti ledger → therefore inspector’s confusion) holds under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating carnival is rendered in selective, urgent detail—calliope thrum, fry-oil sizzle, neon kraken—that constrains tactics (hiding markets, rerouting crowds). The stone chip micro-setting reappears at the end to charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survive gentrification—tightens when the inspector arrives early; the graffiti gambit narrows options and forces a visible trade-off between authenticity and camouflage. Escalation is causal and single-cycle, sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of negotiated identity under threat emerges through concrete particulars (graffiti as ledger, stone as heritage). Final image reframes the Revel’s “messy freedom” as deliberate code—resonant, non-moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked; sensory filtering (“sour sweet air,” “garish carnival”) is character-specific. Dialogue with Zola is terse, goal-driven, and carries subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet vivid; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful (“chaotic symphony,” “neon kraken”) and never muddies causality. High information density advances every line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The premise—graffiti as covert civic ledger—feels fresh and inevitable; the fusion of carnival anarchy with cryptographic order is specific to this world. Risky structural choice (quiet, encoded victory) pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
