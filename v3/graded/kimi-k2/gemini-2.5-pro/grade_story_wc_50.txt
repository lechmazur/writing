<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is textured and embodied—his “peripherally focused” trait drives every tactical choice, from placing pins to reading glints. Motivation (“store wonder”) is dramatized through the painstaking ledger work and the final lever push, not stated. The Earned Stasis—completion without immediate audience—carries visible cost in weeks of solitude and bodily fatigue. A hairline slip: the moment of interior contradiction could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each reflection charted adds density until the cadence shift of the first reawakened echo. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the cavern’s silence becomes charged with sound and light, cost paid in “days bled into weeks.” No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by 3rd paragraph. One minor ellipsis (how quartz catches sound) is motivated by the POV’s gradual discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The marble cavern is not backdrop but instrument: its curvature dictates reflection angles that Elian must obey. Micro-setting—the steel pins and sunbeam—literally constrain every tactical move. Final image reuses the cavern’s surfaces as resonator, charging the closure. Sensory selection (cold marble, faint glints) mirrors Elian’s narrowed focus under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore the harvest of echoes—signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each mapped angle tightens the possible solution space until only one reconstruction remains. Cost is time and solitude; the “wounded season” externalizes the pressure. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of preservation versus presence emerges through concrete labor: wonder is not hoarded but re-embodied. Subtext in the silence—what is saved may never be witnessed—lingers without sermon. Final shimmer of candlelight on marble reweights the premise: stored wonder now walks the walls. No thematic echo spoken aloud.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, tactile, slightly cool—matching a locksmith who trusts metal more than men. Syntax lengthens during observation, tightens during action (“He fitted the final component”). Perceptual signature: angles, glints, ledger grids. No dialogue; absence feels consistent with solitary craft. Rhythm modulates with task tempo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet luminous; every sentence advances either mechanism or mood. Figurative language is sparse and accurate (“celestial clock hand”). No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“lattice of spun silver”) is justified by POV’s artisan precision. Final paragraph achieves Charged Poise without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—echoes as harvestable memories tuned by light geometry—feels inevitable yet fresh. Tropes of the lone artificer and the broken machine are transformed through the cavern’s physics and the peripheral method. Specificity of quartz facets and reflection angles anchors the concept. Risk in quiet lyric payoff succeeds.</comment>
