<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity and “functionally creative” trait are embodied in her scavenging, wiring, and final choice; the contradiction between demolition duty and hope-seeking is dramatized through action. Interiority is specific and grounded in tactile detail. The cost—accepting that hope is a current to reroute, not an equation—is felt in her quiet, solitary stance under alien starlight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (find sextant → decode coordinates → rewire power → insert key → throw breaker) tightens options and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration—the ceiling becomes a galaxy, reweighting the terminal’s purpose. Orientation is anchored early; closure lands with visible cost (diesel fumes, spent generators, irrevocable change of space).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The terminal’s layered decay (ozone, popcorn, greasy napkins) is filtered through Elara’s engineering gaze; carnival detritus and hidden conduits alike constrain her improvised circuitry. The resurrected star-chart ceiling reconfigures the setting itself into the final image, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can this ruin still point toward hope?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each obstacle (dead grid, missing key, limited fuel). The final illumination is earned by her agency and carries an unmistakable cost: the generators will soon die, the vision is temporary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: hope is not abstract but engineered from wreckage. The carnival’s trash and the architect’s hidden dream converge in the star-chart, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Final image reweights the premise—terminal as monument, not departure lounge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, slightly lyrical—“ghost of a ghost,” “hallowed glow of an alien sky”—yet remains within an engineer’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature sustains through the final beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances image or action. No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful, never muddling causality. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar “ruin-punk” and “abandoned carnival” tropes into a fresh synthesis: the spaceport as failed cathedral, the sextant as cryptographic key. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious, grounded in specific engineering detail rather than gimmick.</comment>
