<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“grip reality loosely” dramatized in hallucinated scribes), but the decisive act—tracing the swan’s folds—rests more on ritual than on contradictory impulse; cost is felt yet not fully earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the regenerative silence reweights the keeper’s stance with visible cost (the inevitable return to duty). Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of saturation → release is taught early and paid off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Library and obsidian refuge are vividly specific, but the obsidian shard only frames the silence rather than constraining a choice; micro-setting (swan, river) is more active. Still, sensory hierarchy and POV bias are exemplary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mental survival under the weight of histories—is signaled early and tightened once by the Aeridor chronicle. Escalation is accretive rather than causal; the cost is felt but not dramatized as a live trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of bearing witness versus self-preservation emerges organically; final image of silent star-river offers non-literal, resonant answer. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature (“dust of ages was the only air fit to breathe”) anchors POV. Compression and elision are taught early and remain legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Minor scaffold (“the silence was not an absence but a presence”) is offset by rhythmic control and zero loops in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of archive-sickness and origami portal; obsidian refuge as anti-memory chamber feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
