<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific (“recklessness was a familiar companion”), but the final beat of self-forgiveness is slightly generalized; the cost is felt yet not fully dramatized in body or choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the valve closes, the ghosts quiet, and the narrator accepts the weight of his inaction. Causal lens holds—each beat because/therefore—and the cost (bone-deep exhaustion) is on the final page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tunnel and submerged machinery are vivid, selective, and directly constrain movement; the beaded valve wheel becomes the charged object that focuses the climax. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—atonement for “I did nothing”—is signaled early and tightened when the ghost shift turns its accusation on the narrator. The final act of closing the valve forecloses the option of further denial with visible physical cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of complicity and the moral weight of inaction emerges organically from the factory’s endless reenactment and the narrator’s mirrored guilt. Final hush offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer: carrying the weight is the only absolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and consistent with a sleeptuned skeptic’s perceptual signature. Compression and elision (“drowsy alertness”) are taught early and paid off in the porous final exhaustion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. Minor filter-verb clusters (“I thought of my own failure”) are offset by immediate embodied action on the valve.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “factory ghost shift” trope is transformed through the psychic-radio frame and the narrator’s skeptical appraisal, creating a fresh synthesis where haunting becomes interrogation. Risky late reveal of shared guilt lands because groundwork is laid in the radio calls.</comment>
