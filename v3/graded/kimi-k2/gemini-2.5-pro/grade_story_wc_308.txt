<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelan’s interiority is embodied and consistent; the arrowhead’s pulse is felt in palm and psyche. The reverent trait constrains the search method and earns the final act of mercy. Micro-choice—humming the arrowhead home—pays the cost of opening the first true path out. One slip: centuries of listening is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sigh realigns the canyon’s drone and reconfigures Kaelan’s horizon. Causal chain—pulse → flock pattern → harmonic thought—holds without gaps. Cost is visible in the “first true path” now open, implying exile from lifelong stillness. Orientation anchors by line 3; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bone towers and dust are not backdrop but acoustic instruments that shape Kaelan’s art. The arrowhead’s texture and the flock’s fracture are tactile and immediate. Environment constrains the final act: only the canyon’s harmonic heart can carry the thought. One minor lapse: “centuries of layered dust” is summary, not lived.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give the wandering pulse direction—tightens once when the flock’s panic reveals the hunter’s regret. Escalation is a single deepening that forces Kaelan from passive listening to active sending. Cost is the loss of eternal stillness. Agency is psychic yet legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of mercy as navigation emerges from the hunter’s regret and Kaelan’s harmonic absolution. No moralizing; the sigh is the non-literal answer. Subtext lives in the arrowhead’s silence after the pulse departs. Complexity lingers: Kaelan’s peace is also exile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“a vertebra the size of a millstone,” “weathered resolve”—with rhythmic control under pressure. Compression teaches the flock-reading method early and pays it off. No head-hop; perception stays rooted in Kaelan’s senses. Distinct texture throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“sky the color of rust”) serve mood without clutter. One mixed note: “chaotic scatter” borders cliché but is earned by flock choreography.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: psychic stone-skimming, bone-canyon acoustics, regret-as-pulse. Familiar tropes of ghostly absolution are transformed through harmonic physics. Risky lyricism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
