<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is thin; her “faith” is asserted rather than embodied. The ghost’s motivation is sketched but never tested in scene. Relationships among the survivors are declared (“family”) without micro-choices that show the crucible. Still, the final smile lands as earned stasis with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: chalk message → reexamine → energy cell → bell → resonance → flight path. Closure is a decisive change (stable corridor opens) with felt cost (abandoning the guardian). One transition (camp → biodome → arch) is legible. Orientation is clear by 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Red dust, bruised sky, and floating arches are vivid and selective. The bell’s tarnish and silent clapper are micro-setting that charges the final resonance. Spatial choreography during the climb is coherent. Environment constrains the climb and supplies the harmonic key.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape to the nebula—is signaled early and tightened by each chalk command. The climb narrows options to one perilous ascent; success costs leaving the ghost behind. Agency is collective but protagonist-driven. No escalation after the bell rings, yet the cost is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of collective hope versus lonely duty emerges through the ghost’s chalk and the family’s ascent. Subtext in the silent bell and final “Go home” reweights loss into promise. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic. Avoids tidy binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara; no head-hopping. Voice is textured (“dust of Xylos tasted like rust and regret”) yet occasionally drifts toward editorial omniscience. Dialogue is sparse but natural. Rhythm modulates with tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive. Occasional elevated diction (“petrified orchards,” “brambled hope”) risks register drift but remains consistent. No loops or scaffold. Final hum is rendered with sensory precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Post-crash survival and benevolent ghost guidance are familiar, yet the tuning-fork planet and chalk-command mechanic feel fresh. Specificity of the silent butterfly bell transforms a twee object into a resonant key. Synthesis is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
