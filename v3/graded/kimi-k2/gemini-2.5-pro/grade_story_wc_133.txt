<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s insomnia, painterly vocation, and “thresh meaning” drive are embodied in sleepless dabs and the final sketch of the woman’s face; the contradictory pull between hoarding the brooch and releasing it crystallizes in the on-page exchange. The woman’s weary patience and inherited loss are sketched with economy, and her presence forces Elias’s decisive renunciation. Cost is felt: he forfeits the object and gains the heavier story. Minor slip: “wryly earnest” is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias returns the brooch, accepts insomnia as companion, and begins a new painting—cost is the relinquished relic and the ache of enlarged soul. Causal chain holds: storm → exposed roots/drone → brooch → woman → exchange → new work. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. One seam: the woman’s arrival is lightly motivated but coincidence is allowed under Situational lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tidal island, causeway, and storm-scoured bluff are vivid, selective, and pressure choices—boots sink, tide turns, terrain yields the convergence. The amber brooch and petrified roots act as micro-setting that charges the final image. Weather and tide function as live clocks. No object or environment constrains the final sketch, capping below 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—extract meaning from a desiccated world—tightens when the brooch offers both aesthetic and human meaning. The exchange is the single decisive beat that forecloses possession and reweights the stake. Cost is legible: Elias gives up the talisman and absorbs the woman’s grief. Pressure is coherent but one-turn; no secondary escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of meaning-through-loss emerges from the convergence of fossil, drone, and heirloom; no explicit statement. Subtext in the silent gulls, the woman’s “tired understanding,” and Elias’s insomnia-turned-companion. Final sketch of her face reframes prior motifs without moralizing. One soft echo: “thresh meaning” skirts label-speak but is earned by embodied action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly, salt-stained, and rhythmically controlled—“haggard awe,” “salt-crusted memories.” Compression and patterned elision (“three tides,” “ghost mainland”) are taught early and paid off. Dialogue is spare, subtext-laden. No POV drift. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” moment but fits Elias’s reflective lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, sensory, and propulsive; sentences advance multiple duties—“the rain trails already softening and blurring” compresses time, stakes, and mood. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“haggard awe,” “conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated. One near-scaffold: “heavier and more nourishing than any nutrient bar” could trim, but does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic painter following storm runes to a fossil-drone-amber knot feels fresh; tropes are inverted into quiet, lyrical archaeology. The exchange of story for relic is a non-obvious resolution that grows from character need. Specificity of tidal island and desalination drone grounds the world. Risky lyric compression succeeds without clarity loss.</comment>
