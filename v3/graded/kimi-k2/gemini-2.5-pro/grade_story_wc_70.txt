<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s compulsion and quiet resistance are embodied in the matchbox gesture; the interior contradiction between truth-telling and preserving wonder is dramatized, not labeled. Lena’s shift from inspector to “person tasked with reminding a city how to feel” is earned by the riddle’s cost. Minor slip: “stubborn desire to preserve wonder” edges toward summary rather than embodied choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lacquer box stays closed, but the riddle reweights the blackout from glitch to cultural starvation. Causal chain—truth compulsion → riddle → Lena’s changed stance—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in Silas’s renunciation of direct disclosure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The tower’s “syrupy, nectar dusk” and ozone air filter every perception; the lacquer box and matchbox function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Silas notices pollen and lightning arcs, not civic blueprints. Final image of arcing lightning recharges the opening dusk with new meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore wonder vs. sterile truth—tightens when Silas withholds the direct answer, forcing Lena to re-experience discovery. One decisive deepening: the riddle reframes the blackout from technical failure to cultural suffocation. Cost is the risk that Lena may still fail.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the riddle’s particulars: mechanized life starved by optimized sterility. No moralizing; the final image of closed lacquer box and arcing lightning reweights the premise without statement. Subtext in Lena’s whispered last line carries the conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: “thick and sweet” air, “sun-spun glass” wings. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during revelation, longer lyric cadences in dusk description. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to Silas’s selective attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High density: “tasting of ozone and the last of the day’s pollen” does triple sensory work. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are precise and internally consistent—“syrupy, nectar dusk” mirrors the bio-mechanical nectar the drones once drank.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Bio-mechanical bees that feed on civic wonder is a fresh synthesis; the blackout as cultural starvation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky withholding of exposition pays off in the riddle’s reconfiguration. No derivative echoes; the lacquer box and matchbox ritual are specific inventions.</comment>
