<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s compassion/anger duality is vividly embodied in micro-choices (tail-fitting scene); interiority balances empathy and pride, then crystallizes into Earned Stasis when he refuses bitterness. Decision to restore tail reconfigures both creature and own sense of decency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single, continuous causal arc (loss → workshop alchemy → silent acceptance) under Causal lens. Closure lands: prosthetic fitting as political choice that forecloses vengeance and price is felt in foregone lizard sale/trust deficit. Tight, inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Misty workshop is not wallpaper: damp dark, medicinal tinctures press on pacing, dim light affects eye-hand timings for micro-suture. Bench micro-setting supplies limited tools that constrain reconstruction path. Specificity charges final star-set shot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rescuer’s identity vs. need to stay gentle after betrayal. Escalation taped to each incremental layer he sheds—anger, pride—into concrete risk of failed prosthesis. Each choice narrows options, carries live danger to chameleon and wallet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fragile convictions theme threaded through non-negotiable acts; compassion is not stated virtue but construction logic of tail. Final turquoise shimmer reweights betrayal into quiet covenant—non-literal but costly answer to “gentle or bitter?”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice distinct—tactile medic idiom, hushed metaphors anchored in faunal specifics (“built for strength but moved with falling leaves”); free-indirect style never head-hops. Sentence rhythm tightens under magnifier pressure, then stills with chameleon pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Line-level: no loops, high-density prose. Stock metaphors dummy–variables re-set by specific verbs: “silent mountain of patience,” “crystallized final moment.” Rhythm adapts from humid long clauses to staccato fitting beats. Mint-condition proofreading.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Wildlife medic crafting micro-prostheses post-scam” is non-obvious synthesis; quiet stillness in denouement feels risky—avenging road ultimately foreclosed by tiny turquoise color return. Fresh angle, earned in particulars.</comment>
