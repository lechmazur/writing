<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interior contradiction—duty vs. hope—is embodied in the tactile ritual of button-sorting; the burn-scarred toggle crystallizes his renunciation with visible cost. Motivation escalates cleanly from obedience to agency, though the absence of embodied emotion in the final beat keeps it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change: Kaelen refuses to turn the hourglass, carrying the chart and jar into dawn. Causal linkage holds—each catalogued button tightens the prophecy’s knot until the toggle snaps it open—cost is legible in the silence after the last grain falls.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The amber warehouse’s resin-caked windows and canyon shadows constrain Kaelen’s monastic labor; the hourglass itself becomes a looming environmental antagonist. Final image re-uses the cliffs and dawn light to re-weight the choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rewrite fate vs. accept doom—tightens with every button placed; the emptying hourglass supplies a live clock. Agency drives escalation; the toggle’s placement is the irreversible turn that forecloses the old cycle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tactile: small human choices weave large doom, yet the same granularity can unmake it. The final comma-not-period reconfiguration is earned, resonant, and avoids moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, lapidary, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through Kaelen’s cataloguing gaze. Compression and patterned diction (“whisper-thin trickle,” “canyon echo in a jar”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“monastic,” “iridescence”) fits the POV’s scholarly remove. One mixed metaphor—“knot of tangled history”—is minor enough not to dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The hourglass-prophecy-button conceit is fresh, fully committed to, and transformed through Kaelen’s tactile hermeneutic. Risky refusal of the expected reset feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
