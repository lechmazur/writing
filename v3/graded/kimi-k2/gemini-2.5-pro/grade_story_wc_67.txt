<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's internal irony—that she builds shelters for others from controlled truth while knowingly withholding cost—is dramatized without summary, especially in the withheld background of the porcelain-masked artist. Kael's final tear and still-posed hand show embodied grief, but the interiority never loops into self-diagnosis; the conflict remains one of external ritual versus internal knowledge. The micro-choice of “gathering every last grain” into the urn feels earned, as it visibly severs Kael’s relationship with presence. Cost is felt: the ash never comes back, the chair will sit lifeless tomorrow, the illusion will crumble.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is the stilled rocking chair crystallized: Kael’s renunciation is enacted as the powder settles into non-motion, the stake re-weighted from “save the wife” to “contain the grief in dust motes.” Causality is situational: Elara’s withholding tightens the pressure into one final, irreversible silence; the cost of the illusion lands as the last creak dies. No loose props or teleporting moves break linkage; every object introduced (urn, chair, mask) constrains the final beat. Lens and closure hold without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The gallery’s “charcoal dust and old paper” scent is filtered through Elara’s curatorial eye; setting constrains choice when only the rocking-chair angle will serve for the scattering. The kiln room’s “scorched brick to gleaming silver” guides Kael’s hand toward surrender, making the physical layout complicit in the ritual. No placeholder white-room, though the vanishing point itself isn’t spatially mapped; it’s atmospheric rather than architectural leverage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—“crystallize a fleeting emotion”—escalates from promise through ritual to the irrevocable final drift of ash across sunlight. The narrowing is situational: each room removes another option until only stillness remains; the price is the forever-lost nuance Elara knowingly burns away. Agency belongs to Kael’s hands tilting the urn; the pressure he withstands is the chair’s dying momentum, not coincidence. Cost is immediately visible: ash cannot be reclaimed. One coherent tightening delivers the illusion of closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Theme emerges from withheld particulars: the cost of simplifying grief into a beautiful lie. The porcelain mask—gold-cracked—mirrors the broken self but is later disclosed as the suicide that undermined the very safety it promised; this re-pricing lands as the ash scatters. No overt moralizing; the final beat reframes Elara’s “serene compassion” as complicit artistry. Resonance is achieved through material image (dust in light) rather than authorial statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Voice is restrained, curatorial, with a tactile lexicon (“gleaming silver tools,” “fine, dark powder”) that refuses to preach. Focalization stays locked to Elara; every sensory note is filtered through her eye, including the whispered vents and the taste of ash she inhales. No register drift—language precise enough to chill without ever lapsing into clinical. The final line’s “exquisite mirage” is a rare moment of summary risk, but it is delivered with felt contradiction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences propel: from “curled, blackened, and collapsed” to “a single shaft of sunlight” the prose modulates in rhythm to mimic the chair’s gradual stall. No scaffold repetition; every clause advances either action or deepening contradiction. Metaphors (“tiny star in the dim room”) are vivid and context-bound, not decorative. One paraphrase loop in “scattered into the vanishing point of the gallery” echoes earlier usage, worth ‑0.2 but does not muddy the final image.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The premise—gallery of engineered illusions of closure—synthesizes ritual, memory, and visual art into a fresh conceit. The mask-of-shards and the ash ritual transform familiar grief tropes into sensory-anchored specifics; the twist that the illusion itself carries death (mask artist’s suicide) reframes the trope of “preserve the memory” into “preserve at a mortal price.” Risk: the premise verges on allegory, yet remains saved by Kael’s embodied choice at the end. Distinct world logic persists across every room.</comment>
