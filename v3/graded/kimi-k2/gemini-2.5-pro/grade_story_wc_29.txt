<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“familiar knot of dread,” “exhausted ache”), motives escalate from observation to interference, and the final choice carries visible cost. The cosmic tricksters remain off-page, so relationship/status dynamics are N/A; the single POV is well-realized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: reverse-engineering → counter-frequency → broadcast → observable de-escalation. Closure is a quiet Decisive Change with felt cost (“tension draining…exhausted ache”). Orientation is anchored by word 60; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The radio station’s “dusty bubble of analog warmth” and the salvaged waveform generator constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventing societal fracture via cosmic manipulation—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: the town-hall collapse triggers the interference decision, narrowing options and exacting an on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of quiet resistance to unseen manipulation emerges organically from Elara’s choices and the subsonic counter-frequency. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: “quiet hope humming into the divided world.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—astronomer’s diction, tactile tech nostalgia, rhythmic control under pressure. No dialogue; internal voice remains coherent and specific throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with purposeful rhythm and zero loops. Figurative language is sparse and precise; no mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph lands with crystalline cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic horror and campus micro-politics; the subsonic counter-frequency as pacifying weapon feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specificity of the radio station and stellar cartography anchors the concept.</comment>
