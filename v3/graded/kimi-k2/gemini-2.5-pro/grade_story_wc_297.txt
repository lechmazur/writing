<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—sap-slow blood, anxious elation—yet the root-bound body never constrains a visible micro-choice; the final path is discovered, not enacted. Motivation is clear and intensifies, but the cost is psychic, not embodied. No second character on page, so relationship crucible N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the straight vector bisects chaos, reconfiguring options with felt cost—“a single, shining thread had been pulled straight.” Causal lens holds: because Kael warns, therefore Elara redirects; the maze clipping’s logic is the pivot. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cobalt glade, ozone, moonpetals—selective sensory triangulation that mirrors Elara’s wired stillness. The weirwood throne and clipping function as micro-setting objects that constrain and finally enable the vector. Spatial coherence maintained; no static cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reknitting the eclipsed covenant—tightens once: the false spiral intersection is rejected for the straight vector, foreclosing oblivion. Escalation is causal, driven by Elara’s push of will; cost is the psychic burn of the clipping and the ongoing root-bound stasis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of re-weaving time emerges from the concrete struggle with the maze clipping and Dissonance scars; no explicit moralizing. Final image reweights the premise: the covenant remains broken, yet a path to begin weaving is clear—resonant ambiguity without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent—“bark was a second skin,” “lightning frozen on skin”—with rhythmic control under pressure. POV remains strictly Elara’s; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic, vegetal, temporal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>High information density—“shimmering, silver traceries,” “psychic prison”—with zero loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise and integrated; no mixed vehicles. Final cadence slows to crystallize the vector without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Temporal rupture and root-bound oracle feel inevitable yet fresh; the maze clipping as logic-key transforms a familiar quest into vegetal cyber-myth. Specificity—“waxy leaves impossibly green”—anchors the speculative frame. Risky lyric compression pays off in clarity.</comment>
