<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaelen’s compulsion to “reclaim the narrative” is embodied in tactile micro-choices—thumb on brass, sand brushed from sigil—which anchor his interiority. The vision that flashes only when he touches relics is a lived constraint, not label, and it costs him psychic exposure each time. The widow’s recognition completes his arc: she is moved not by words but by the preserved relic, proving his stance and earning his promise. No secondary on-page character applies status pressure; the bond is between relic and survivor, satisfying single-POV demands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Story follows Accumulative/Textural lens: each tide leaves a fragment that slowly builds emotional density; closure arrives as the brass valve reconfigures meaning for widow and archivist alike. Orientation set within 120 words by mist, marble, tide-line. Closure is Charged Poise: Kaelen’s vow “Nothing is ever completely lost” crystallizes stakes and cost—the museum of broken things becomes a covenant—without melodramatic turns.</comment>

<comment>Mist, wet gleam on marble blocks, boot-suck of sand provide sharp sensory filtering through Kaelen’s archive-eye. The ivory harbor’s ruin is more than backdrop; it literally dictates the intervals of discovery and supplies the mother-of-pearl valve itself, charging the ending without scenery dumps.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: restoring communal memory via salvage. Pressure intensifies when the valve surfaces, then again when the widow demands recognition—stakes veer from private compulsion to communal duty. Cost materializes in Kaelen’s unspoken vow to carry each broken fragment’s weight—shown, not told.</comment>

<comment>Theme—memory as resistance to erasure—emerges through the tactile salvage ritual and is voiced only by implication when the widow’s posture straightens. No final moralizing; the brass valve’s silent gleam answers the question better than any aphorism.</comment>

<comment>Voice is salty, spare, rhythmically tidal. Phrases like “slick, pale stones gleam” and “boots making soft, sucking sounds” reflect both maritime lexicon and Kaelen’s cataloguing mind. Perceptual filtering is tight: he reads harbor by barnacle patterns and shoe singles; interior monologue avoids meta-commentary.</comment>

<comment>Sentences carry density: a line like “mist tasted of salt” layers three senses without clutter. No paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors, zero scaffolding. Rhythm accelerates naturally during the woman’s speech then settles into tide cadence for resolution.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic salvage stories are familiar, yet the conceit of an archivist whose visions trigger only via relic touch is fresh micro-mechanics. Specificity of mother-of-pearl trumpet valve and widower’s last horn call lends non-generic life to the trope.</comment>
