<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kaelan shifts from Archivist to Smelter and back, with genuine interior contradiction—empathy must weaponize heat, identity liquefies and recasts—but the cost is felt more as an abstract shimmer than a singular, readable loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis: the tide retreats leaving memory-smelt swimming quietly; every cycle must recommence so the path is never wholly closed. The lens is strictly Accumulative/Textural; each new moon refills the forge rather than causes change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tidal atrium and the lunar oculus are rendered with precise sensory economy, and the micro-setting—the basket, the basin forge—directly constrains Kaelan’s hands. A few generic phrases (“quiet brass,” “salt-scrubbed architecture”) nudge it off the 9-band margin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are beautifully focused—restore wonder from raw, unprocessed grief—but after the initial tremor there is only a single intensification rather than a progressive narrowing; the cost remains atmospheric more than tangible choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The story refrains from overt thematic statement; wonder and routine emerge through the repeated ritual of smelting sorrow into starlight, culminating in the final image of contented fish—an evocative thematic repricing that defies tidy moral summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, poetic yet never overwrought; compression is intentional and legible, and the internal rhythm of brass mechanisms harmonizes with the lunar cadence. One brief filter-verb flurry toward the end prevents perfect 9.3.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Sentence craft is exquisite—every line carries density and momentum. Only a single over-dusted metaphor “polished bone” over the moon drifts toward ornament, the slightest flicker of redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Identity that migrates with the moon and the oceanic forge is not new in science-fantasy, but nowhere is the fusion rendered with such specific ritual and emotional gravity; the contrapuntal roles of fisher and furnace feel inevitable in hindsight, not gimmickry.</comment>
