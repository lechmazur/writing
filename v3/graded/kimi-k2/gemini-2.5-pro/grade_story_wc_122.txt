<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—her devotion to her vanished hearing and her engineered silence—are embodied in her boots and the cracked phonograph needle. The ache between joy & grief that powers every micro-choice feels lived, and the final renunciation (the “filament of hush” accepted instead of lost sound) carries visible cost on the audience’s faces and her own blood-lit fingers on the cartridge.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: each backward-spinning pass thickens pressure until the cavern’s “mirrored hush” reconfigures space from void to cradle. Closure—the stillness that feels ‘full’—reweighs the premise with a conceptual price: further listening now demands this fragile ritual. One micro-turn: the inverted chord’s last pulse leaves a literal vibration in the stone, a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt weight.</comment>

<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The limestone drum-belly does constrain movement: footsteps, cushion layout, and the bass grooves’ pathway through stone are concrete. Yet the broader acoustic economy (how limestone itself refracts vibration) remains underexploited enough to cap below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—numbness—is signalled in the opening line and escalates by tactile density, culminating in the shared shudder that collapses isolation. The single tightening (needle meeting vinyl) forecloses the option of ever hearing the music again; the cost—the knowledge that only this inverted silence works—rides out on Elara’s hand.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme—redemption by crafted absence—emerges from bass tremors, the inversion of grief, and the communal tear-silence rather than a thesis. Final paragraph’s “quiet hopeful intake” answers without moralising, offering an earned emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Voice modulates cleanly from bodily detail (“stone drinking the bass”) to crystalline interiority without register drift. The perceptual signature—soundless vibration made visible in muscle and stone—persists under peak pressure; no head-hopping or filter clutter.</comment>

<grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Every sentence performs dual duty: “backward cascade unwinding into a gentle searching beginning” fuses image with causality. Rhythm breathes with scene need, zero loops or purple scaffold; near-pinned descriptors (“filament of hush,” “bass grooves traced into the floor”) are pattern-taught early and pay off in closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.3</question>
<comment>Deafness used as an instrument rather than metaphor; backward-wound vinyl as therapeutic séance is a fresh synthesis. Risk—building climax through pure tactile silence—amplifies stakes without gimmickry and feels inevitable on reread.</comment>
