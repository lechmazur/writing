<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between his hyper-awareness and disorientation is dramatized through micro-choices (grip on strap, ankle angle). Motivation crystallizes in the final beat: “mathematics of mercy” becomes an active quest. No relationship crucible on page, but single-POV arc earns credible Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: “He lowered his hand… a reminder of the question he was built to answer” reconfigures the forest from prison to crucible with felt cost. Causal lens holds—each memory trigger is linked to bodily stance. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no teleporting props. One tightening beat suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>UV forest and bone-white tree are not backdrop; their hum and pressure force the brace stance and shape final image. Sensory selection (ozone, moss, violet weight) filters through Kaelen’s proprioceptive bias. Micro-setting (pewter strap) constrains grip and memory cue. Spatial choreography clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove mercy is computable—signaled early and tightened when the forest is revealed as experiment stage. Agency: brace action narrows options, crystallizes stance. Cost: “perish in the static” remains live threat. No external antagonist needed; pressure coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of mercy as rounding error emerges from concrete events (mask fitting, graphs, forest hum) without sermonizing. Final image reweights premise: crucible not punishment but test. Subtext in strap’s shift from desperate anchor to purposeful tool. Ambiguity preserved—no moral delivered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct: clinical precision (“micro-gram accuracy”) collides with lyric urgency (“symphony of self-knowledge”). Perceptual signature rooted in proprioceptive hyper-awareness. No dialogue, so no register clash. Tense and psychic distance stable. Compression taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence advances knowledge or pressure. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“ultraviolet penance”) are earned by context. Rhythm modulates with stress—short clauses under hum. No overwriting in peak beats. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: enhanced proprioception as interrogation by-product, UV forest as living experiment, mercy framed as math problem. Tropes transformed through embodied stakes. Risk in quiet ending pays off—no escape, only deeper question. Specificity prevents generic dystopia.</comment>
