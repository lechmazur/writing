<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is vivid—concrete sensory cataloguing, embodied chill, and the shard’s cold against skin—but the sister-memory is told more than dramatized, muting the contradictory pull between grief and duty. The final renunciation (redirecting the cascade) is earned and carries visible cost in the snapped silence, yet the withheld-truth motive never collides with an on-page opposing impulse, keeping the arc slightly one-note.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bay’s silence is re-weighted from haunting to paid debt, with the felt cost of forever losing Elara. Causal chain—shard sight → recognition of cascade → redirect—holds cleanly under a Causal lens; no orientation drift. The withheld-truth reveal is timed precisely to trigger the decisive act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The repair bay’s rust, ozone, and fractured gantry are filtered through Kael’s sensory priorities; the shard itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial anchors are immediate; the bay’s silence after the redirect is charged with new meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover and neutralize the truth behind Elara’s death—tightens once the cascade is recognized; the redirect is a clear trade-off that forecloses rescue. Pressure escalates under causal logic; cost (permanent loss of contact) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of silence-as-debt emerges organically from the bay’s hush and the parents’ withheld grief; the final map entry crystallizes it without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shift from “ghosts” to “finality,” letting the reader re-weight the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—precise sensory diction, rhythmic control under pressure (“hum screamed, then snapped”). Compression and elision are purposeful; no head-hop. The shard’s perceptual signature is consistent and character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data or stakes. No loops or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual instability of existence”) is brief and voice-motivated, not intrusive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The sensory-cartographer conceit, shard-as-lens, and resonance-cascade bleed-through synthesize into a fresh angle on multiverse grief. The risk of abstract physics is grounded in tactile detail; the final silence feels inevitable yet non-generic.</comment>
