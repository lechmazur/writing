<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific ("sweet sorrow of being the sole witness"); the poet’s motive to translate lost voices into jars is dramatized through the act of capturing sounds. A single micro-choice—uncorking the jars in a ritual around the box—earns the closure with visible cost (the surrender of the captured sounds). No contradictory impulses are shown in scene, so the 9+ quick test is not fully met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—each captured sound layers texture until the final release reweights the box’s silence into a new song. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the box is not fixed but transfigured, and the cost is the irretrievable loss of the collected sounds. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The loft, dunes, and tide are filtered through the poet’s selective perception; the driftwood ribcage and salt-bleached timbers constrain movement and frame the final performance. The pearlescent seashell placed atop the box charges the closure image. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: to redeem the box’s silence without restoring its original song. Pressure tightens as each jar is opened, foreclosing the option to keep the sounds. Cost is the permanent release of the captured echoes—felt on the page when the loft falls into “a new kind of silence.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the poet’s refusal to repair the past and instead translate its ghost into present language. Subtext resides in the silence that follows the symphony: continuance born of loss. The final image of the shell on the lid offers a non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent: “feral loft beneath the dunes,” “ribcage of driftwood.” Syntax modulates with emotional intensity; the long sentence of uncorking mimics the swell of the emerging song. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every image advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, mixed metaphors, or register drift. The final paragraph’s cadence slows to mirror the fading resonance, achieving charged poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The conceit of bottling sounds is familiar, yet here it is transformed through the specific coastal ecology and the poet’s refusal to restore the music box. The synthesis feels inevitable: a eulogy and rebirth composed of wind, heartbeat, and foghorn.</comment>
