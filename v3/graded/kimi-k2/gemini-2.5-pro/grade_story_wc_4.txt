<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s calm is embodied in the tactile ritual of arranging photographs, but the interior contradiction—his desire to “transmute pain” versus the quiet cost of witnessing—remains largely summary. The final placement of the girl’s photo is a clear micro-choice that forecloses his return, yet the stakes of that renunciation feel scaled to the town rather than to Elias himself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mosaic’s completion reweights the factory ruins from scar to spiral of recovery. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each season’s vine growth and new photo tighten the pattern until the final image releases the town’s grief. Cost is visible in Elias’s quiet packing-away of the fulfilled case.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lavender field and rusted factory form a charged micro-setting that constrains Elias’s ritual space; the scent and skeletal walls filter every beat. The vines’ slow climb mirrors the mosaic’s outward spiral, charging the final image with earned transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completion of the healing mosaic—escalates through seasonal returns and accumulating photographs. One decisive intensification occurs when the girl’s gesture completes the spiral, foreclosing further additions. Cost is felt in Elias’s solitary departure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete act of arranging grief into pattern; no moral is stated. The final image of the paper boat reweights earlier photos of loss into release, offering resonant ambiguity about who is truly healed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in tactile detail—“rust-red walls,” “diamond-shaped wire.” The perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices arcs and echoes, not explanations. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the final spiral.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with the ritual’s slow pace. Occasional elevated diction (“transmute,” “communion”) is justified by Elias’s archivist vocation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise—an anonymous archivist healing a town through photographic mosaics—is fresh and specific. The risk of sentimentality is avoided by grounding every beat in sensory detail and by making the town’s recovery implicit rather than declared.</comment>
