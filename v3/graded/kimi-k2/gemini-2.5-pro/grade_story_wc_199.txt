<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete (tangible soil stains, mossy delight) and Elian’s single micro-choice—the fingertip prod—compresses everything he is (tender order) and forecloses his quiet anonymity. Minor over-articulation of “consuming motivation” once prevents the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single-scene causal drive holds: the leaf falls (act 1), anomaly isolated (act 2), one prod collapses stakes into irreversible change (act 3). Cost is legible in the arbor’s breathing and in Elian’s skin taking light. Closure earns full resonance without loose causality.</question>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Vivid specificity—clay bowls, mica flakes, ash flaking to viridian—anchors the skyborne arbor so tightly that only the chosen POV could inhabit it. Environment constrains the choice by literally crumbling under the final prod.</question>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (decipher or drowse) tightens into one irreversible prod; the felt cost is the arbor shifting from ashen hush to awakened green, Elian left no longer anonymous. Escalation obeys causal linkage until options vanish in light.</question>
<question>5</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from seed sorting and leaf monuments; “monumental power of the very small” crystallizes in the closing image without sermon. The refrain about every cycle emerging transformed is earned, not asserted.</question>
<question>6</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct rhythmic signature—gentle lilt in “mossy delight” under growing hush—never flattens. Lexicon remains firmly in the perceptual grain of a seed-child’s world, no register drift.</question>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Clarity and lyricism balanced: no loops, no mixed metaphors. One mild pleonasm (“single, impossibly small”) and a close “his heart thrumming” near peak keep it shy of 9.</question>

<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The Arbor-Heart folklore reborn as a speck of dust feels inevitable yet non-derivative. The seed-sorting cosmos with twilight monuments to memories offers a fresh angle on rejuvenation myths.</question>
