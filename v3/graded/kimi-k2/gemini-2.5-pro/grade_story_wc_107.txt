<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the bookmark triggers a credible thaw of grief that alters her final choice. The renunciation of the sphere carries visible cost and is foreshadowed by her escalating fear. Minor slip: “crystalline prison of grief” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she abandons the sphere and the station, foreclosing her safe-zone dream with felt cost. Causal chain (thaw → structural failure → flight) holds under a Situational lens. One micro-turn suffices; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The corroded control room and dripping pipe anchor space early; the collapsing floor and tilting room constrain the final exit. Bookmark and furnace act as micro-settings that charge the ending. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—craft one perfect lens versus survive—tightens once when structural failure forces abandonment. Escalation is coherent under situational pressure; the cost (loss of art and sanctuary) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of thawing—both planetary and emotional—emerges through concrete events: melting ice endangers the station while the bookmark melts Elara’s frozen heart. Final image of “weighty lightness” offers resonant, non-moralizing closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; dramatic narration of mundane tasks becomes a character tic that modulates under stress. Syntax and diction reflect Elara’s performative coping that collapses into raw fear. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. Rhythm accelerates with danger. One minor loop—“steady drip… steady trickle”—is deliberate echo, not artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic glassblower in a thawing ice station feels fresh; the fusion of craft, grief, and planetary change is specific and non-generic. The bookmark’s return reweights the premise without gimmickry.</comment>
