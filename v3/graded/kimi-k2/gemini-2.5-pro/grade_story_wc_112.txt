<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s obliging steadiness is embodied in scarred hands and micro-choice to pull the lever; the quiet vertigo and sideways-fall sensation crystallize interior contradiction. Aris’s tremor and tears give credible cost to obsession. Relationship pressure is light but present; the mechanic’s obedience alters both men’s futures. No slips touch closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: “I need your steadiness” → lever pull → adjacent hologram. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Elias’s universe re-calibrates with mechanically warm vertigo as felt cost. Orientation anchored by violet gas-giant glow and silent plains within 120 words. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Violet glow, icy Xylon night, and the station’s mechanically warm lattice are selective, sensory, and purposeful. The crystalline-wing hush supplies a live clock that tightens the scene. Environment constrains the experiment to the twilight window and charges the final image of the cradle holding multitudes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove lateral time—signaled early. Single tightening: lever pull collapses infinite nows into visible adjacent Elias, foreclosing linear certainty. Cost is Elias’s vertiginous re-calibration and Aris’s tear-streaked vindication. Agency and pressure cohere under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of simultaneity emerges from concrete experiment rather than statement; final image of “multitudes” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in Aris’s tremor and Elias’s quiet vertigo carries the conceptual cost. Resonant ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature—hydraulic stains, calloused fingers, sideways vertigo. Rhythm modulates with pressure: stillness before pull, mechanical click, then soft sigh of life support. No head-hopping; diction remains within Elias’s lived lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive: “icy warmth of a held breath,” “mechanically warm truth.” No loops, no mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports the subdued crescendo. Final line lands with crystalline precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Lateral-time premise is fresh yet grounded in tactile detail; subdued awakening as narrative strategy feels inevitable. Risky quiet climax pays off through embodied cost. No derivative echoes; specificity anchors universals.</comment>
