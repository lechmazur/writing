<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Silas's quiet, protective compulsion is believable: embodied in "cold dread seized him" and micro-choice of sea glass vs wrench. Circle of stones at close makes change visible. Loneliness motif is over-articulated ("luminescent ache"); still, interiority is specific to reticent man of habit. Passes threshold for immediate print with minor tightening.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—circle "Farewell" reframes their entire relationship with felt cost. Causal chain (lamp dies → ascent → repair → final signal) is tight. Only mild slippage: keeper’s presence inferred via note, not dramatized. Still, stakes foreclosed with clear before/after.</comment>

<comment>Granite spire, iron door, Fresnel facets are precise; storm chop is visceral. Circle of stones at final beat satisfies environment-as-constraint test. Minor: beam flicker described more from mainland porch than clifftop POV.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—protect the light and the unspoken bond—is signaled immediately via lamp failure. One decisive intensification: lamp dies → solitary ascent amid storm. Cost legible when solitary "Farewell" stone acknowledges keeper is gone forever.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: intimacy across silence and the ache of unrecoverable care. Circular stone image reweights earlier pyramid/spire language into closure without overt statement.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is tight, perceptual signature steady—seafarer who sees in tools, wind, and silence. "Cold weight in his pocket" and "solid fragment" are internal touches. No head-hopping; perspective disciplined.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Economy of motion mirrored in syntax: "practiced, silent economy." One minor near-repeat phrase ("strange and fragile intimacy") could trim. Otherwise, rhythm mirrors chop and hush, no clutter.</comment>

<comment>Intimacy by stacked stones as surrogate letters is a fresh inversion of lighthouse folklore. Synthesis feels inevitable: silent language, final circular silence. Not radically novel, but human specificity offsets genre tropes.</comment>
