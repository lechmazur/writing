<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interiority is precise—his quiet correction of the disciple, the ceramic mask’s coolness, the “whisperfield calm” all embody motive. The final renunciation of the pavilion’s noise carries visible cost: he walks alone into desert silence. One slip: the “strangely honest” label is asserted rather than dramatized in dialogue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kael seals the echo and forecloses further debate. Causal chain holds—distortion in pavilion → descent → consecration → sealed dune. Cost is legible in the final image: “They could debate… It no longer mattered.” No orientation drift; lens is causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Desert heat, bleached leviathan rib, cool subterranean air—all tactile and POV-filtered. The kinetic parapet’s obsidian lenses constrain the ritual; the sealed dune recharges the opening image. One missed chance: pavilion interior could have pressed harder on Kael’s senses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve ungarbled wisdom—is signaled early and tightened when zealotry distorts it. Escalation is single but sufficient: the disciple’s loud misreading forces Kael’s descent and irreversible act. Cost is the solitude of guardianship, felt on the final line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of interpretive drift versus preserved truth emerges through action, not lecture. The conjured clearing becomes a literalized metaphor for uncluttered wisdom. Final image reweights earlier “tapestry of doubt” into silent certainty without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is spare, rhythmic, and internally coherent—“loom of sound,” “bleaching sun,” “hissed and retracted.” Perceptual signature stays consistent; no POV leakage. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the ritual sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; every sentence advances image or motive. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“kinetic parapet,” “consecrate”) is justified by the esoteric frame and remains consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar prophet/disciple setup is transformed through the kinetic-parapet ritual and the notion of crystallized thought-space. Specificity of the leviathan rib and obsidian lenses anchors the invention. Risky compression pays off in the final sealed silence.</comment>
