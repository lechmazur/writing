<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“a chill traced its way up his spine”), but the shift from portrait thief to custodian of futures is asserted more than dramatized; the final stance crystallizes with felt cost yet lacks a prior micro-choice that visibly forecloses the old life.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the jar reweights Silas’s entire vocation. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of light imagery tightens to the final moonlit image. One transition (sunset → midnight) is clean; cost is legible in the portraits now “flat.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emerald Station’s spectral green glow constrains movement and supplies the only illumination; the marble pedestal and glass panes are tactile anchors. Micro-setting (jar on pedestal) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shift from stealing past to stewarding futures—is signaled early and tightens once when the cereus/tulip code redirects him. Agency is present but the cost is more conceptual than visceral; still, the narrowing of options is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of time’s capture emerges organically from portraits vs. moonbeams; final image reframes destiny without moralizing. Subtext in the floral code and the “luminous disbelief” carries the weight. Complexity lingers—no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“ghost haunting the brief, perfect moments”). Perceptual signature is consistent; no POV leakage. Compression in transit maps and lunar charts is purposeful and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is propulsive and image-dense without clutter; only minor filter-verb clusters (“he felt”) in the climax keep it from 9+. Metaphors cohere; no loops or scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm is strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses art theft with speculative moon-capture in a way that feels inevitable in hindsight. Floral code, green station, and destiny-as-door are fresh syntheses. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
