<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is embodied and specific (“marrow of her bones,” “shard of glass in her heart”), and her contradictory impulses—yearning to understand vs. fear of the answer—drive every micro-choice. The final renunciation (no longer asking why, but finishing songs) is earned by the mother-memory and costs her the comfort of ignorance. Only the mother’s silence is told rather than dramatized, a minor slip.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lyra’s stance crystallizes when she harmonizes shell to crystal, redefining her purpose with visible cost (tear, acceptance of perpetual service). Causal chain holds—each echo and whisper tightens the next choice—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The serpentine nexus is evoked through tactile motion (“soft boots making no sound”) and the crystal formation that literally completes the shell; environment constrains the final harmonic act. Starlight, dust, and stone are filtered through Lyra’s grief-sharpened perception. Only the cosmic “hum” edges toward abstraction, slightly blurring spatial edges.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—why some echo—signaled in paragraph one; pressure escalates via each warped echo and warming shell until the final harmonic choice forecloses the question and imposes lifelong duty. Cost is legible: perpetual service replacing curiosity. One clear tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “unfinished cosmic debt” emerges organically from the echo mechanics and Lyra’s personal loss; the final image of her becoming “finisher of songs” offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing. No thematic drift or late exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“quiet mist,” “liquid silver”) that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent—grief-tuned synesthesia—without head-hop or register drift. Compression and elision (“cycles,” “cosmic debt”) are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“resonant frequency”) is justified by the mythic register. Final cadence shift is earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The echo-as-cosmic-debt premise feels fresh, and the shell-crystal completion is an inevitable yet non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry; transformation test passes—plot and arc collapse if elements are swapped.</comment>
