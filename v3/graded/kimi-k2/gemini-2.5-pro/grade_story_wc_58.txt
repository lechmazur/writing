<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is textured and embodied; the thread as “biography in miniature” crystallizes his arc. Motivation—mapping healing—drives every beat, culminating in the earned insight that healing is containment, not erasure. The final act of writing carries visible cost: he writes until the light is gone, foreclosing any other path that evening. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Kaelen’s understanding of Elara’s absence flips from loss to triumphant arrival, with the cost of his own deepening solitude. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. The persistent constraint of the sealed island charges the final quiet.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Garden, thread, and journal function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the chill bench forces the projection inward, the thread is the literal map, the journal the only permissible action. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“rust-colored chrysanthemums and fallen pear leaves plastered to the mossy ground”). The dying light charging the final image satisfies the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding Elara’s absence—tightens once when Kaelen realizes her “explained absence was the most triumphant journey.” The deepening is driven by his agency in projection and writing; cost is the deepening cold and the irrevocable nightfall. No external reversals are needed; the internal shift suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: healing as cartography of pain rather than erasure. The scarlet thread’s reprise in the final paragraph reweights its meaning from relic to completed map. No moralizing; the insight is earned through embodied experience. The closing image of two travelers “sharing a quiet understanding on a map of their own making” offers non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“lonesome splendor,” “mournful fire”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Kaelen notices scent, texture, and temperature with a cartographer’s precision. No POV slippage; compression in the projection sequence is taught early and paid off. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“perfume of rust-colored chrysanthemums”). High information density without overwriting. Final paragraph’s cadence mirrors the dying light, achieving Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—“obituaries for the living”—is transformed through the specificity of weaving grief into geography. The scarlet thread as map-key feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression is executed without clarity loss. No derivative echoes; the synthesis is singular.</comment>
