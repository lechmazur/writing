<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is vivid—his refusal of the “sterile, forward-only world” and his embodied dance anchor motive and contradiction. The final transformation is earned: the obsidian verse on his arm is the visible cost of exile becoming genesis. Minor slip: “obsidian grace” repeats as label rather than evolving trait.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dance shifts from remembering to being, exile to fledged cosmos. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory gap widens until the moonstone ignites the final pattern. Cost is legible in the irreversible skin-etched verse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The twilight garden is no backdrop; its moss, jasmine, and star-gaps are the very instruments Kaelen plays. Micro-setting (moonstone on skin) constrains the final act, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—memory as resistance—tightens through widening gaps and deepening silence until the dance must succeed or fail. One decisive intensification: spontaneous anchoring narrows options to “become the pivot.” Cost is the irreversible bodily inscription.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: memory is creation, exile is aperture. The obsidian constellation on skin is the non-literal answer—no moral stated, only embodied. Subtext pulses in every gap observed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“obsidian grace,” “cool, dark fire”—with rhythmic control that mirrors the tide dance. Perceptual signature is consistent: Kaelen’s noticing is selective, weighted toward absence and gravity. No POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. The final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Fusing astrophysics with flesh-dance feels inevitable, not gimmick. The nostalgia-ban world is sketched in one phrase yet fully credible. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
