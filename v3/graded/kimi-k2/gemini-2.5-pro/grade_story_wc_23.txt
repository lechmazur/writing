<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s grief for his daughter is embodied in the censer foot’s weight and the moonlit hum; his micro-choice to slot the bronze into the cradle crystallizes a renunciation—he builds a path for others he cannot take himself. Interior contradiction is present but brief; the cost is felt yet not fully dramatized in body or voice under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the dish thrums, the signal blooms, and Elias’s stance reconfigures from private mourning to public beacon. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each midnight call and scavenged wire layers density until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in the line “he hadn’t brought his daughter back.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The starlit station, bronze censer foot, and moonlit gantry constrain every move; the cradle’s empty socket and the dish’s skeletal frame charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered—starlight “felt solid,” bronze “hummed.” No orientation debt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—building a lighthouse for the lost—is signaled early and tightens once: the midnight call forces the decisive placement of the bronze. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens; cost is the irreversible exposure of his own unhealed loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of grief as geography emerges through the censer foot’s weight and the reverse migration’s pull; no explicit moralizing. Final image of the silent song offers a resonant, non-literal answer—solace through service rather than recovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is spare, starlit, and tactile—“the wind a low moan,” “the ache…a physical thing.” Perceptual signature is consistent; no POV drift. Compression and patterned diction serve the Accumulative/Textural drive without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or action. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—“light the color of a winter dawn” charges the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic lighthouse built from ghost constellations and bronze relics feels fresh; the reverse migration trope is inverted into a homecoming that cannot heal the builder. Specificity of the censer foot and moon-phase sight prevents generic drift.</comment>
