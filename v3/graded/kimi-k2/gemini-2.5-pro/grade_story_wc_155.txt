<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid, embodied self-portrait of an aging artist whose memories and micro-choices under creative pressure ring true; the “quiet ache” motive stays felt and personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Follows a causal-accumulative design: memory image grows toward display, each beat tightening because/therefore logic; orientation is clear by paragraph three.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fog-shrouded orchard, light-mural wall, and fresco shard anchor space and tool; sharply sensorial detail that intrudes on choices (light bleeding vs. desire).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pressure tightens around the single stake—recovery of lost joy—until the mural snaps into focus; cost is the gentle fade of the daydream, cleanly shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme surfaces through embodied grief and partial redemption: joy rediscovered in fragility, not permanence; the wordless laughter charges the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct poet-observer voice; interiority filters everything through sensory recall and selective attention; no head-hops, rhythm varies with emotional swells.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Memory-as-fiction device repurposed effectively; “painting with light” and dream orchard feel specific rather than showroom quirky, landing a resonant farewell image.</comment>
