<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s interior contradiction—desire to appear vs. inability to let go—is embodied in the tightening of his tunic and the stone-pond trance. Elara’s reversed-aging life is shown through her “ancient eyes” and the cost of passing knowledge forward, not told. The final micro-choice—Kael’s quiet “I see”—earns the renunciation of his anchor with visible cost. One slip: “drowning in your own wake” edges toward diagnostic label-speak, blunting embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the reversed ripples reweight the rule-set of appearing by letting go. Causal lens holds: because Elara withholds the final piece, Kael must discover the retraction principle himself. Cost is legible in Elara’s vanishing youth and Kael’s relinquished insistence on presence. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no ambiguity at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating rock’s magnetic grotto and mirrored pond constrain every beat—keeping them aloft, holding water still, enabling the time-reversal demonstration. Starlight “sharp enough to cut” and sycamore hush texture the stakes without clutter. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and pebble track across the platform. One missed chance: the grotto could have audibly faltered to charge the final image further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Kael must learn to appear by vanishing—is signaled in the first paragraph. Escalation tightens once: the backward-flowing ripples force the conceptual trade-off of releasing self-location. Cost is visible in Elara’s accelerating retreat into childhood and Kael’s forfeited grip on his sister-search. Agency remains Kael’s; coincidence plays no role.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of relinquishing ego to traverse emerges from the pond reversal, never stated. Subtext in Elara’s smile and the collapsing ripple carries the weight. Final image reconfigures the premise without moralizing. No thematic drift; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s selective perception; perceptual signature is crystalline and star-bright. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during trance, longer breaths after. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-laden; Elara’s moss-soft voice contrasts Kael’s tight register. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; each sentence layers image, emotion, or rule. Metaphors are precise—“starlight sharp enough to cut”—and never muddle causality. No loops, scaffold, or filter-verb stacks. Rhythm accelerates during the backward ripple, then exhales with the final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The reversed-aging mentor teaching disappearance to appear is a fresh synthesis of familiar tropes. The pond-as-time-device feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at introduction. Specificity of the magnetic grotto and crystalline platform anchors the concept. Risky temporal mechanics are fully committed to without hand-waving.</comment>
