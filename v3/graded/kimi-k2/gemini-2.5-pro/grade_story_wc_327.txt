<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s obsession with texture-to-sound translation is embodied in every micro-choice (climbing the bone tower, twisting the diamond). The final tone is the earned cost: he gains the first true word at the price of lifelong solitude. Interiority is specific—“copper-veined hands trembled”—never label-speak. One flaw: no contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene; motivation is monolithic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the canyon’s silence births a single resonant tone, reweighting the premise that language survives in matter. Causal chain—dusk starlings → spiral glyph → diamond alignment—holds without gaps. Cost is palpable: “the first true word… spoken in a generation” carries the weight of cultural extinction. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern intensifies to cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bone towers and echo-chasm are not backdrop; their textures become the lexicon Kaelen must read. The diamond’s internal fracture and the starlings’ spiral are micro-settings that literally constrain the final alignment. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—copper-veins feel vibration, not sight. Every detail is selective, purposeful, and charged in the final tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the Old Tongue—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when Kaelen risks the climb. One decisive turn: aligning the diamond with the starlings’ spiral collapses the echo-hurricane into a single tone. Cost is the irreversible silence of a million phantom voices; options narrow to one pure note. Escalation is textural density, not causal reversals, fitting the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: language as embodied memory, survival etched in bone and wind. Subtext lives in gesture—the trembling hands, the spiral recognized in flight. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: the world itself speaks, but only after human witness ends. No thematic echo or meta-commentary; resonance is purely imagistic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“the canyon held its breath”—with rhythmic control that mirrors the escalating spiral. POV remains locked; no filter verbs dilute immediacy. Diction stays within Kaelen’s plausible lexicon; copper-veined perception colors every sensory note. Compression is taught early (“etched in the substance of the world”) and paid off in the final tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances texture or stakes. Metaphors are spare and coherent—“a plucked string the size of a mountain.” No register drift; elevated diction is earned by the mythic register. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line crystallizes the new cadence. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—reading texture as resurrected language—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Bone towers, cursed diamond, and starling syntax synthesize into a singular vision. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test fails if any element swapped; specificity is absolute. No derivative echoes.</comment>
