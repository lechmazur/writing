<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-to-purpose arc is embodied in tactile micro-choices (polishing, folding, projecting) and culminates in a visible cost: surrendering the tattoo stencil itself. The woman’s minimal presence still functions as crucible; her first spoken words crystallize the shared loss and validate Elias’s risk. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding therapy-speak. One minor slip: “teach withering to bloom” leans label, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the projected constellations reweight both characters’ grief into shared pattern, with the stencil’s sacrifice as felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each origami adds density until the final illumination reconfigures meaning. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. One beat of possible teleportation (Elias “watching from shadows” then suddenly behind console) is forgivable at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory’s layered curtains, obsidian benches, and forge are selective, tactile, and directly constrain choices: only the dais and specific telescopes activate under intention. Light itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean. Slight over-reliance on visual; a non-visual cue could sharpen one beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elias’s need to transmute grief into shared hope—tightens through each origami offering; the final projection forecloses his private relic. Escalation is accumulative: each gift raises emotional ante until the stencil’s loss pays the price. Agency remains with Elias; coincidence only reveals, never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme of renewal-through-loss emerges from concrete acts (crane, fox, lotus) rather than statement. The stencil’s transformation from private scar to shared cosmos reweights the motif without moralizing. Subtext in silence and gesture carries the emotional truth. Final image invites multiple readings, all earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Voice is hushed, metallic, precise—matching Elias’s craft and grief. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens under action. Free indirect style stays clean; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature: grief is “smith,” curiosity a “flicker.” Only two lines of dialogue, but they land with subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence layers image and motion. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (cosmos as flower, tears of fire) are fresh and coherent. Rhythm modulates with emotional beats. One minor filter stack (“he watched… he knew”) but does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Transforms familiar grief-recovery arc via origami astronomy and “curtains of intention,” a non-obvious mechanism that feels inevitable in hindsight. Tattoo stencil repurposed from relic to projector is a fresh inflection. Risky quiet ending pays off in Charged Poise. No derivative echoes.</comment>
