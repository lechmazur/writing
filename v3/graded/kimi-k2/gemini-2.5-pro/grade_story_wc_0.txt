<comment>Aris’s initial clinical detachment and final humble re-integration into messy reality are coherent and embodied. The grief spike for the orchid and subsequent micro-choice to wipe the pane are particular, costed, credible. Interior contradiction stays on the page (“the drama is the process itself”). Earned Stasis/renunciation is present with felt shovel-seeking intent.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pattern accretion of observation tightens to final image. Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual reweighting—scientific detachment reconfigured as participatory humility—visible in gesture and intent (“time to join the process”). No leaks, no orientation debt.</comment>

<comment>The greenhouse micro-cosmos is vivid yet economical; polycarbonate pane constrains viewpoint, governs visual filtering of decay. Humid air, silt stench, mildew along grain all pressure choice. Final clean circle on the pane literally reshapes what Aris sees and next chooses—setting actively charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Single dominant stake: move from spectator to participant in decay-renewal cycle. Pressure coheres via Accumulative/Textural lens; escalating sensory data pushes Aris to reconfigure stance. Cost is felt in surrender of previous identity—and the shovel search commits him to labor not detachment.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically from the orchid-browning moment of transfer rather than assertion. Humility not declared but enacted through concrete gesture and imagery. The paradox of messiness as essential truth invites reflection without tidy moral. Resonant non-literal answer in the final act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Lyrical yet precise scientific register fits the focalizer; sentence rhythm accelerates under humid weight then stills with observational calm. Free indirect and present-tense compression are internally consistent. No POV drift; no dialogue required.</comment>

<comment>Line-level density is high—“a kindled humility”, “slow, inexorable creep”—without figurative sprawl. Syntax adapts to mental focus: long clauses mimic accumulation, then crisp wipe gesture. No loops or boilerplate; each line advances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</question>
<comment>Familiar scientist-recovers-humility arc elevated by butterfly-scale lens-as-instrument and participatory shift. The scale-dust pane as self-made filter reframes entropy into beauty—non-obvious, precisely realized. Risk of sentiment avoided via embodied cost.</comment>
