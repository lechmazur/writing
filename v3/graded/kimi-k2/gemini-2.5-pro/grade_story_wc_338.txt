<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s methodical curiosity and shielded openness are dramatized through tactile micro-choices—handling vellum, freezing film frames, annotating “threshold found.” The interior contradiction between her need to know and her empathy for the mapmaker’s silence is embodied in the final restraint: she does not repair the tear but marks it, paying the cost of leaving the unknown intact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: tear → research → footage comparison → lichen shift → recognition of sealed door → annotated threshold. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tear’s meaning flips from damage to deliberate portal, with the felt cost of renouncing closure-by-repair.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Archival glue scent, projector hum, and rain-scoured vault texture are filtered through Elara’s professional gaze. The vault’s lichen pattern becomes the pivot object that constrains her final choice; the setting literally writes the clue on its own surface.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—interpret the silence without violating it—tightens when the lichen rectangle proves the door was opened once. The single deepening beat (discovery of the seam) forces Elara to decide between knowledge and preservation; the cost is the irreversible acknowledgment of the threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the motif of thresholds: every frame, tear, and lichen line is a limen. The final annotation crystallizes the thematic repricing—some silences must be kept, not solved—without overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and slightly hushed, mirroring the archival setting and Elara’s shielded openness. Syntax tightens under pressure—“She froze the frames, her breath fogging”—then widens into the resonant final sentence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence layers archival detail or investigative motion. No loops, no mixed metaphors; the single “spider-scratch of ink” is earned and exact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of cartographic restoration, silent film forensics, and neolithic seal is fresh yet inevitable. The whispered chapel concept is transformed from trope to tangible mechanism: lichen as time-locked lock-pick.</comment>
