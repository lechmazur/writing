<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is embodied (the weight of names as silence, the ribbon’s texture under his fingers) and his obsession with collective grief is consistent. The spectral mentorship is evoked rather than dramatized, so the final epiphany feels slightly gifted rather than earned by contradictory impulse. Micro-choices (retracing slate, leaving the nameless stone) align with motive and carry visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the abstract web on the slate crystallizes Elias’s new stance toward grief. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each night’s retracing adds density until the storm-beat image reweights meaning. Orientation is swift; greenhouse, dusk, and slate are anchored by 80 words. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of names and the thundering calm that follows.</comment>

<comment>The greenhouse’s decaying glass and damp earth mirror Elias’s internal rot and growth; vines “like skeletal fingers” constrain his movement toward the bench. Butterfly flight paths overhead become the final metaphor for networked grief, charging the closure. Selective sensory detail (cool slate, storm-rattled panes) stays inside Elias’s stone-carver priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—shape of collective grief—is signaled early and tightened by nightly ritual and storm pressure. One deepening: the storm forces the final stroke that completes the web, foreclosing the option of individual epitaphs. Cost is the abandonment of the grandmother’s literal inscription, traded for the abstract pattern.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as living network rather than static monument. The woven ribbon, butterfly veins, and slate web accumulate meaning without authorial thesis. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing; the reader feels the cost of letting names go.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“orange wings like flickering embers,” “thundering calm.” Syntax modulates with pressure: longer reflective sentences contract to the chisel’s decisive tap. No POV drift; perception stays stone-carver specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. Occasional elevated diction (“spectral mentorship,” “conceptual repricing”) is brief and voice-motivated. No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent. One mixed moment—“thundering calm” skirts oxymoron but lands as intended paradox.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gravestone carver who erases names to map communal grief. Familiar tropes (butterfly migration, greenhouse sanctuary) are transformed through tactile stone work and the anti-monument. Risky choice to end with abstraction rather than epitaph pays off via earned image.</comment>
