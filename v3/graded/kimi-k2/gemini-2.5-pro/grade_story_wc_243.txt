<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her “gentle thoroughness” is dramatized in the risky steeping of the photograph. The final choice to walk the jetty and share the locket is earned by prior causality and carries visible social cost. Tomas appears only at the end, so relationship crucible is limited, but Elara’s solitary arc is coherent and charged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat (locket discovery → steeping → revelation → jetty meeting) links by “because/therefore.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the towns’ feud is reframed through the restored image, with the phosphorescent buds as undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation drift; anchors are clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Archive smells, ceramic dish, salt-scrubbed jetty, and phosphorescent buds are selective and purposeful. The locket itself functions as micro-setting that constrains choice. Sensory detail narrows under urgency (steeping scene) and widens at the blooming jetty, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—healing the towns’ false feud—is signaled early via the “violently misunderstood” covenant. Escalation tightens once: the restored image forces Elara to act, foreclosing the option to remain neutral. Cost is legible in the haunted euphoria and the absurd weight of a century’s hatred.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of love misread as enmity emerges organically from the locket’s image and the blooming jetty. Subtext operates in gesture (Cael offering sea-lavender) and silence between Elara and Tomas. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: “a love powerful enough to bind cities” quietly reborn under starlight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; perceptual signature is archivist-sensual (“aging paper and preservation,” “chemical covenant”). Syntax modulates with tension—long sentences for immersion, clipped fragments at the jetty. No POV leakage; Tomas’s awe is filtered through Elara’s observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is controlled and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Rhythm accelerates during the steeping and softens at the jetty, mirroring emotional cadence. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<comment>Familiar feud trope is transformed through archival restoration and bioluminescent flora. The locket-as-testament feels inevitable in hindsight; no close echoes. Risky chemical baptism and ghost-lit jetty heighten stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of walnut husks and sea-lavender anchors universals.</comment>
