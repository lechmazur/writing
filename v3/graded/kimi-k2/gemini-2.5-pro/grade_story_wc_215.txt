<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's decade-long silence is embodied and costs: every tight-throated swallow, every ghost-directed micro-choice is idiosyncratic and ties directly to renunciation in the final beat. Internal contradiction—guard the words vs free the ghosts—drives two visible reversals.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causality holds under an Accumulative/Renomerer lens: each spectral drift tightens silence into shared cost. Closure lands as Charged Poise when the honeycomb box reweights meaning and forecloses permanent solitude.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Scorched apian graveyard and fragile honeycomb glass are handled, smelled, lifted—micro-setting indistinguishable from stakes. Spatial choreography along the sundial bench anchors every beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>One dominant stake—freeing tethered ghosts—intensifies from mute vigil to decisive unsealing. The tightening is earned rather than escalated spectacle; suffices for lyric-accumulative design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: unspoken grief as spectral anchor is reconfigured into shared benediction by the final honey-glow. Subtext in ghost-eye contact suffices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct silent-observer signature, rhythm flexes under grief’s pressure. No head-hops; alembic diction platonic Elias’s lexicon. Final five sentences crystallize stance with controlled breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Sparingly ornate in service of silence: no synonym loops or filter-stacks. “Fissured reds across weathered knuckles” is specific and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Non-obvious synthesis—ghosts as embodied unsaid—combined with quiet reversal from tomb-seal to joint release invests the desert tableau with inevitable resonance.</comment>
