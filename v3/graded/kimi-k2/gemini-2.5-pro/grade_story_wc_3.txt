<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s inner contradiction—grueling grief versus scientific drive—propels every choice; her embodied precision in the garden and the final seed ritual crystallize a compelling, earned arc of collapse into inquiry.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Closure cleanly lands via Decisive Change: grief encoded into physics, arbor mid-note shift semitone, license earned by analogical spine—no payoff feels forced or off-stage.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Magnetic arbor constrains tactics (high-field planting), doubles as micro-setting and tool; specific field line details charge final knowledge-image rather than mere scenery.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—prove order persists—tightens via field-force metaphor; Kael’s absence as compressed waveform raises cost and forecloses simpler mourning.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Thematic question (can absence be translated?) emerges from concrete actions; final seed-prayer reconfigures grief into logic without tidy moral, ambiguity retained.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct scientific-curate diction, sentence rhythm rises under pressure; interiority reads as Elara rather than omniscient lecturer; no POV drift across beats.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Breathing cadence accelerates with stakes; efficient pruning—no filter-verb stacks or physical contradictions; final line re-weights earlier waveform metaphor cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: treating life as waveform/seed-Rosetta feels inevitable once set; risk in quiet closure pays with conceptual reprice; no template plot.</comment>
