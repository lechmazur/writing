<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “peculiar sensitivity” is dramatized through tactile handling of the shard and the physical click of satisfaction. Motivation (“to become visible to those who need you”) is stated early and enacted in the final beat, but the cost is felt more by Anya than by Elias, muting the personal stakes. No contradictory impulses are shown in-scene; the arc is linear rather than internally contested. Still, the micro-choice to place the tape is character-specific and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (dust, flicker, sapphire hush) intensifies until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Anya’s hope replaces Elias’s anonymity, the cost being his continued invisibility. Causality is tight: the grid outage → lost archive → fragment → offering → reaction. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The library’s stuttering light and “sapphire hush” are not mere backdrop; the failing grid creates the stakes and the darkness enables Elias’s stealth. The ventilation shaft and oak table function as micro-settings that constrain movement and frame the gift. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. However, the city outage remains abstract, never impinging on tactics beyond premise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescuing Anya’s lost oral history—is signaled early and tightened once: the fragment is the last copy. Escalation is textural (flicker → dawn) rather than causal, but the pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in Elias’s self-erasure, though it feels more symbolic than visceral. One meaningful turn: the decision to leave the tape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory’s fragility and the ethics of invisible caretakers. Subtext resides in Elias’s refusal of recognition—“he had not been seen, but he had been found.” No explicit moralizing; the final image reweights the value of anonymity versus acknowledgment. The shard itself becomes a charged emblem of what survives systemic collapse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“the dust itself had long since accepted” his silence. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences in reflection, clipped fragments during retreat. POV remains tightly focalized; no filter-verb bloat. The “sapphire hush” motif is taught early and paid off in the closing hush. Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; every sentence advances atmosphere or action. Figurative language is selective—“ferromagnetic ghost” is apt and brief. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor register drift toward the poetic is consistent with the lyrical mode. Final paragraph is unmarred by artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The premise—an unseen archivist who “feels” data ghosts—feels fresh yet inevitable. Tropes (mysterious benefactor, last surviving record) are transformed through sensory specificity and the refusal of reveal. The risk of sentimentality is avoided by keeping Elias offstage at the end. The synthesis of obsolete media and empathic caretaking is non-obvious and thematically coherent.</comment>
