<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is intimate and specific; crystalline malady embodied and costly. Memory of grandmother is leveraged as micro-choice catalyst, motivating the abandonment of scholarly tools, credible within character logic. Final renunciation is visible—quill as stylus, whispered naming—not merely stated. Slight distance kept from deeper flaw cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): “blank page ready for new stories” reweights stakes at personal scale. Causal arc holds—each technique tried, each failure, each inherited superstition tested—until abandonment yields result. Cost is felt in release of named hurts, but not as sharply priced as moment demands. Minor penalty for crystallized metaphor feeling slightly ornamental.</comment>

<comment>Stone platform and surrounding abyss establish silent pressure. Crow quill as recurring intimate object counts as micro-setting; reweighted when tipped away as stylus. Sensory detail stays sparse, selective—wind, stone chill—yet not as fully fused into final choice. Atmosphere supports tone, but setting doesn’t alter available action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Stakes crystallize early: inability to dissolve scars. Escalation tracks progressive failure of ink methods, rising cost each attempt. Softening dust, not shattering, offers gentle but visible payoff. No external pressure added; all from internal constraint—sufficient for 600-800 scale.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Emergent theme: knowledge vs acceptance, academic vs folk ways. Subtext carried through whispered names—not labels, but embodied recognition. Final “runes were not always written with ink” is a resonant image without abstract sermon. Avoids tidy moral; complexity respected, earned in concrete acts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Voice is consistent, elevated but character-bound to scholar-poet. Perceptual filter marked by rune language, sensory precision. Compression and patterned syntax serve rhythm—no unmotivated lapses. Only minor drift toward lyrical overload near description of frost, but not at peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Sentence rhythm tightens under pressure; internal punctuation of semicolons aids breathless build. One small loop: “crystalline structures did not shatter, but softened, their sharp edges blurring” — a near restatement of “softened” cost −0.1. Otherwise high info density; no other artifacts. Final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Concept—stress-crystallization as literal affliction—feels fresh, executed via lived detail not ornament. Quill repurposed from pen to stylus is a clean twist; whispered naming as healing practice transcends cliché through embodied cost. Some risk hedged: platform floating in sky could have deeper world payoff, but constrained lens keeps focus.</comment>
