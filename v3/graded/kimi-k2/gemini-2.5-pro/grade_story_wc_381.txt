<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is concrete—her “focused calm of a star about to fold” is character-specific—but the piece never lets us feel an internal contradiction; the prophecy’s threat stays abstract, so her choice to erase it costs her nothing we can see. The origami wing is handled, yet its emotional history or personal stake remains blank; she never risks failure or regrets the hush. Earned stasis is asserted (“work done until…”) rather than paid for in a visible forfeiture, so the arc feels competent but not crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the coded prophecy is silenced, the brook’s natural sound returns, and the origami wing reverts to “just a piece of folded paper,” a crisp CR image that reweights the tool’s former power. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each paragraph thickens the quiet until the final cadence shift releases tension. Cost, however, is only conceptual—no lost energy, no personal price—so the beat feels resolved but not charged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The brook, mossy stone, and moon-drenched clearing are sketched with selective sensory strokes; sound hierarchy (water baseline vs. coded rustle) guides attention and choice. Spatial anchors are clear early; no orientation debt. Yet the environment never fights back—no wind disturbs the paper, no night creature interrupts—so setting supports mood without constraining tactics, keeping the score just shy of the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prevent prophecy-driven chaos—is declared early and tightens through each paragraph as the “insidious rustle” is hunted gap by gap. Agency is interior and accumulative: Elara’s mapping and tide-like release meaningfully deepen the stakes rather than flip them. A visible personal price is absent, so escalation feels atmospheric, not visceral, capping the band below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the ethics of silencing dangerous speech versus bearing its cost. The final image of secrets “asleep” invites ambivalent reflection without moralizing. Because Elara’s own stance never wavers, the thematic tension stays external; the reweighting lands on the world, not her conscience, yielding strong but not searing resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to Elara’s perceptions; diction (“terrestrially cosmic,” “cartographer of silence”) is lyrical yet consistent with her arcane vocation. Rhythm swells and ebbs in mimicry of the tide metaphor, teaching the pattern early and paying it off in the hush release. No head-hop or register drift; voice is distinctive and controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Metaphors (river-stone cool, placid inferno) stay coherent and purposeful. A few elevated phrases (“architecture of fate”) flirt with register inflation but occur outside the climax, leaving closure image unmarred. High density throughout—every line advances atmosphere or magic logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>“Mapping silence” as active cartography feels fresh, and the origami wing’s transformation from starlight key to inert paper offers a lovely conceptual reprice. The contagion-of-whispers premise is familiar, but the solution route (expanding stillness rather than battling sound) supplies a non-obvious inflection. Risk is moderate—lyric accretion over plot danger—so the piece stops short of the highest originality band.</comment>
