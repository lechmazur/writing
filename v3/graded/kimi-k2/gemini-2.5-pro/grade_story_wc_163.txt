<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the burnt feather anchors contradictory impulses—grief and hope—without therapy-speak. His micro-choice to dim the dome and wait quietly reveals a hierarchy of values (shared wonder over proof). Elara’s shift from skepticism to awe is credible, but her interiority is sketched rather than dramatized, keeping the score just below 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared exhale crystallizes belonging without tidy resolution, cost felt in the feather’s dulled grief. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of geothermal pulses and jelly light tightens to a single charged image. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. One minor ellipsis (how Kaelen “mapped” the pulses) is paid off by the spectacle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is selective and purposeful: groaning metal, emergency lighting, and the dome’s plasteel constrain every move. The abyssal blackness evolves into a living meadow that directly charges the final image. Micro-setting (the burnt feather in Kaelen’s pocket) functions as tactile anchor. No excess exposition; every detail filters through POV urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving belonging before sunrise—is signaled early and tightened by the literal clock. Escalation is accretive: flickering conduits, dwindling time, then the luminous payoff that reweights isolation into connection. Cost is visible in the feather’s softened edges and the irreversible sunrise departure. One meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: belonging is not replacement but shared rhythm. Subtext lives in Elara’s silence and the synchronized glow of dying machines and living jellies. Final image reframes the burnt feather without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers in the violet sunrise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise: “symphony of stressed metal,” “shadowseam wonder.” Syntax mirrors Kaelen’s quiet intensity; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual (“Show me then, star-reader”). Compression taught early (“breathes slowly”) pays off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense: each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is sparse and purposeful. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis—sound and touch dominate, then light. Final line lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: landscape astrology in an abyssal city, geothermal pulse as heartbeat, burnt feather as emotional seismograph. Tropes are inverted—jellies as constellations, sunrise as deadline not hope. Risky quiet ending earns its resonance. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
