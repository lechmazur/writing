<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen’s interior contradiction—serenity vs. doubt—is embodied in the tactile tracing of the stick and crystallizes in the decision to reverse his method; the cost (self-doubt, lost relationship) is felt. Elara’s absence still pressures him via memory and accusation. The final micro-choice—opening the trunk—forecloses retreat and is earned by prior beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change: Kaelen commits to a counter-performance that reconfigures his artistic ethic. Causal lens holds: the argument → doubt → stick → decision → trunk. Cost is legible in the “heavy and cold” question he now carries. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The decommissioned dome’s hush and the viewport’s first stars frame the emotional stakes; the stick and trunk act as micro-settings that constrain choice. Sensory detail is selective—meteor hush, polished concrete—filtered through Kaelen’s artist gaze. Environment does not yet fully charge the final image, capping at 7.9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—ethical responsibility for the audience’s despair—tightens when the hollow-eyed man’s stillness revisits Kaelen. One meaningful turn: the decision to answer the prior show with a new one, narrowing options from pure provocation to dialogic provocation. Cost is the risk of further harm and the loss of artistic purity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of narrative responsibility emerges through the stick’s contested meaning and Kaelen’s reversal; no moralizing, only charged ambiguity. Subtext lives in gesture—tracing notches, opening the trunk—rather than statement. Final image of “tiny, distant pinpricks” offers a non-literal answer: possibility after abdication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is precise, calligrapher-lyric (“exquisitely jointed marionettes”) yet restrained; perceptual signature is consistent. Compression and elevated diction feel earned for the POV. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens with doubt. Rhythm modulates from languid reflection to decisive action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“meteor hush,” “ideogram”). Sentence variety supports momentum. One minor filter stack (“He remembered…”) is acceptable mid-scene. No artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Puppet-show ethics explored through calligrapher marionettes feels fresh; the campfire stick inversion of communal vs. subversive storytelling is specific. Risk lies in the quiet, interior reversal rather than spectacle. No derivative templates; synthesis of craft and moral inquiry is organic.</comment>
