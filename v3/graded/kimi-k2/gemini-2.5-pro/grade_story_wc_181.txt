<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen’s contradictory drive—obey “never understand” vs. pursue forbidden knowledge—remains embodied and tense; the micro-choice to pocket the shell and later re-enter the orchard crystallizes his arc with visible cost (rule broken, role redefined). Interiority is specific and sensory, never diagnostic. The only drag is a brief explanatory lull in the bathroom beat that edges toward summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the shell’s emptiness is reweighted from void to backward-bequeathed face, costing Kaelen his prior identity as mere observer. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of sensory density and paradox accrues until the final image reconfigures meaning. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 40. Causality is nonlinear yet legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The astral orchard’s ghost-silver branches and nonexistent breeze are vivid, selective, and thematically charged; the pistachio shell itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final realization. Sensory hierarchy follows Kaelen’s bewildered focus. One minor spatial fuzz: the asteroid’s “silent deep” is atmospheric but could be more tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Kaelen break the mandate to understand?—is signaled early and tightens once when he chooses inquiry in the bathroom. The cost is conceptual: he forfeits his safe ignorance and accepted role. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens; sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of temporal inversion and identity inheritance emerges organically from the orchard’s rules and Kaelen’s epiphany; no explicit moralizing. The final image of the shell waiting for a descendant’s face offers resonant, non-literal answer to “what is a curator?” Complexity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric, precise, slightly bewildered, matching Kaelen’s perceptual signature. Syntax modulates with pressure (short clauses during breakthrough). No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Occasional elevated diction (“achingly empty”) stays within Kaelen’s introspective register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“thousand phantom suns” returns as “miniature nebulae”). One paraphrase loop (“He braced… He splashed…”) is minor. No artifacts in closure beat. Strong read-aloud rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The nonlinear-inheritance orchard and backward-bequeathed cameo offer a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of time and identity tropes. Risky structure (lyric accumulative) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of the pistachio shell as genetic ghost feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
