<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s barefoot vulnerability and inherited opera glasses crystallize her lineage and motive; the shift from awkward to virtuoso is embodied in the hum’s crescendo. The final stance—standing charged with planetary resonance—earns its cost in the burned-out bay and her solitary vigil. Minor slip: “awkwardly confident” is asserted more than dramatized until the hum begins.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the single sustained note re-ignites the rebellion’s heartbeat via bedrock and satellite, with the cost of exposure and irreversible activation. Causal chain—alignment, resonance, broadcast—holds cleanly under the Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation drift; anchors set by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The repair bay’s bruised light, scorched floor, and dormant gantries are filtered through Elara’s caretaker gaze; every sensory choice primes the stone circle’s awakening. The obsidian monoliths and flickering console ghosts constrain her method and charge the final image. Micro-setting (bare feet on cold ferrocrete) tightens stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—rekindle a crushed rebellion—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is one sustained intensification: silence → hum → planetary pulse. Cost is the irrevocable signal and her exposed solitude. Agency is pure; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of resurrection-through-fragility emerges from the opera glasses’ repurposing and the hum’s quiet insurgency. Final satellite blink reweights the entire rebellion as living echo. No moralizing; resonance is carried by image and vibration alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is tactile and sonic—metal on soles, thunderous serenity. Syntax modulates from hesitant fragments to flowing crescendo matching the hum. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; every clause advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. “Frozen lightning” and “constellation of ghosts” are precise and earned. Rhythm breathes with the scene’s rising thrum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Rebels using seismic lullabies and opera-glass optics to awaken buried megalithic tech is fresh synthesis. The transformation of defeat’s detritus into a resonant weapon feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric escalation pays off in the satellite’s silent blink.</comment>
