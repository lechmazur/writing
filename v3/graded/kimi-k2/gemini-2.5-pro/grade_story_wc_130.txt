<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is precise and embodied—his grief is rendered as tactile geometry, not label. The micro-choice to push the “empty space beside me in bed” into the stone crystallizes motive and cost. The only cap is that Lyra remains off-page, so relationship-as-crucible pressure is absent; the story compensates by making the void itself the crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lattice of light reweights the void from formless terror to named structure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each chip, crack, and drip accretes until the final image reconfigures meaning. Cost is legible in the “quiet sense of order” that is explicitly not happiness. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cavern orchard is not backdrop; its dripping stalactites nourish the trees that supply the very silence Elian measures. The mosaic stepping stone is micro-setting that literally accepts the glass eyes and channels grief. One hairline slip: “wet limestone and faint blossoms” could be sharper, but the final lattice projection recharges every prior sensory cue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—quantify the void—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is a single deepening: the lattice reveals the void’s shape and how Elian’s life now frames it. The cost is the irrevocable recognition that loss remains; no reset. Agency is renunciation of denial, crystallized in the final “he could continue.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the equation of absence: grief has geometry. The lattice image offers a non-literal answer—loss becomes a structure that can be inhabited rather than erased. No moralizing; the insight is earned through the stone’s data points and the light’s living theorem.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, precise, slightly arcane—“living theorem of light and shadow”—yet stays within Elian’s conjurer lexicon. Rhythm breathes with the orchard’s drip and hush. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal texture is consistent. One minor filter-verb cluster (“he could see”) but it does not dull the final lattice beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and luminous; every sentence advances image or motive. Figurative language is selective—“seedling in the dark, fertile ground”—and never clutters the high-pressure lattice moment. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. The final paragraph’s cadence slows to mirror earned stasis.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of grief-mapping, taxidermist optics, and subterranean horticulture feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. The “mathematics of emotion” trope is transformed through tactile ritual and stone data. Risk—the entire plot is a quiet kneeling—heightens stakes by refusing spectacle. No derivative echoes.</comment>
