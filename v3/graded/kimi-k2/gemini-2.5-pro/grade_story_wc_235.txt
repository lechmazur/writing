Editor's Assessment for Elite Venue  
Drive lens identified: Accumulative/Textural — the primary arc is an internal layering of tension and emotional density until a final pattern-break lifts the chronicler into a charged reconfiguration. The chosen lens holds.

<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrator's jealous hunger for past selves is palpable and specific (“obscene hope”), and the closing shift from envy to cartographic awe is earned through embodied cost (the actual loss of nostalgic agony). Interior contradiction between chronicler and resentful observer surfaces in micro-choices: abandoning fantasy maps, then resuming them on new terms. The arc stops just short of a full 9-band because the cost—trading longing for perspective—is articulated more emotionally than concretely.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “a single, coherent story” crystallizes with visible cost (abandoning a lifetime of envy) under the Accumulative lens. Scene anchors tight by word 60; pattern of memory stacking and release is legible. No orientation debt, no breaks in causality. One minor slip: the leap to literal flight blurs narrative reality yet fits the established textural logic without wounding cohesion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cabin interior and porch window function as body-proximal setting (“knots like judgmental eye”) constraining action; the aerial vantage reweights meaning at closure. Selective sensory selection (pine, dust, cold altitude) matches urgency and POV priorities. Lacks the environmental constraint gate (no weather, terrain, or altitude danger alters tactics), so capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—distill the chronologically broken self into art—is signaled early and intensifies through “feral nostalgia” and self-loathing. The deepening happens in midflight when the map blurs into one curve; this single pressure point is sufficient under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the surrender of jealousy itself. No external reversals or antagonist required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme—memory and identity stitched out of chronology—emerges from concrete image (grave dates) rather than stated thesis. Final reweighting (“they were points on a single map”) is non-literal and resonant. Minimal risk of thematic echo since no articulation repeats in prompt-like phrasing. Complexity endures: no tidy resolve, no sentimental redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is textured—compressed clauses, rhythmic breath of envy (“jealousy quieted / They weren’t separate people...”). Distinct perceptual fingerprint maintains over stress. Filter-verb counts stay low; minor repetition (“scroll / scroll”) functions as thematic echo rather than clutter. Sustains lyric compression yet lands closure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Syntactic variety high; no scaffolding loops or synonym churn. “Bitter taste” and “wild symphony” verge figurative, but each serves present-moment urgency without clutter. One brief “jealousy of my past selves” borders label yet is recontextualized by action. Overall momentum clean; minor line-level slips contained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lucid dreaming memoir and temporal envy is specific and personal, avoiding stock dream-explorer tropes. Risk is taken in equating flight with temporal transcendence; the risk pays conceptually because the emotional logic stays tight. No derivative grave-visit trope; the stone itself is transformed into reweighted cartography. Fresh inflection lands with coherence.</comment>
