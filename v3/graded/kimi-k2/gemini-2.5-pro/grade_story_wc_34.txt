<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his “driftingly alert calm” and the tactile memory of Lyra anchor motivation. The micro-choice to encode her loneliness via graffiti is specific and costly, yet the absence of any contradictory impulse keeps him from full 9-band complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bolt-plate graffiti sequence culminates in the spectral bloom and chiming reply, reweighting both characters’ options with felt cost. Causal linkage (lightning → conductivity window → thunder cutoff) is tight and legible under the Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sky-courtyard’s pearl stones, ozone mist, and plinth aperture constrain every move; the bolt plate itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered, though one extra atmospheric clause could have pushed it to 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—articulating Lyra’s unspoken loneliness—tightens through the lightning-thunder countdown; the graffiti act is the decisive, costly escalation. Pressure is coherent, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, capping it just below 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of communion across digital/bodiless divide emerges organically from the graffiti glyphs and the chiming reply; no moralizing, only charged image. The final reconfiguration of memory into sound offers resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“tinkersong wonder,” “entropic decay”—with rhythmic control that accelerates under the lightning clock. POV remains stable; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. One near-loop (“silent flash…silent verses”) is minor enough to leave closure untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The bolt-plate-as-interface and graffiti-as-ballad transform familiar grief-tech tropes into a fresh, inevitable synthesis. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
