<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s weary resignation and stubborn spark are embodied in the micro-choice of assembling the beacon; the cracked nut at the end is a felt cost that forecloses his next rescue. Interiority is concrete (“felt the coming cold in his bones”), not abstract. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies under the frost clock. The single POV is coherent; no relationship crucible is required.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story opens with clear who/where/when anchors within 120 words and sustains a Causal lens: the horn call triggers Elias’s action, the beacon’s activation causes the bird disorientation and the glowing path. Closure is an Earned Stasis: the nut is spent, the path fades, and Elias’s burden is renewed with visible cost (“cracked and hollow husk”). No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and approaching frost are vivid, selective, and directly constrain choices (time pressure, bird patrols). The beacon itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered (“heard it… swallowed by the wind”). Spatial choreography is coherent; weather actively shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guide the traveler before lethal frost—signaled early. Escalation is a single meaningful tightening: the frost clock narrows options, forcing the costly beacon use. Agency is Elias’s decision to spend the nut; the price is the cracked husk. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the traveler’s escape is earned by Elias’s action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of reluctant guardianship and graceless sacrifice emerges from concrete events; no moralizing. The cracked nut reweights the caretaker’s curse without explicit statement. Ambiguity lingers: Elias saves one but remains bound. Subtext is carried by the “graceless beauty” of his stuttering, functional craft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptions; no head-hopping. Voice has a weathered, tactile texture (“rough-hewn doorframe,” “dented tin box”). Syntax modulates with pressure: longer reflective cadence early, clipped urgency during assembly. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; every sentence advances atmosphere or action. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is purposeful (“spectral thread,” “lethal mirrors”). Strong verbs and concrete nouns dominate. Rhythm varies naturally; no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The caretaker/mechanical-bird labyrinth synthesis feels fresh; tropes are grounded in sensory specificity. The “graceless beauty” of Elias’s telekinetic assembly is a non-obvious inflection. The cracked nut’s reprise is inevitable in hindsight. Risky compression (no dialogue, single scene) heightens stakes without clarity loss.</comment>
