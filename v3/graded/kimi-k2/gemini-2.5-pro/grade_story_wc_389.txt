<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid—his loneliness, the weight of shepherd-prophet duty, and the contradictory pulls of the shadow-voices are embodied in the static hiss and the diamond stylus. The final choice to reject both spectral masters and call for human allegiance is earned by the map’s revelation and the cost of his isolation. However, the “ancient shadows” remain somewhat abstract, muting the flaw’s bite.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the storm’s pause and the first real sunlight reweight the premise—dawn is human-made, not spectral. The causal chain (map → broadcast → storm break) is legible under a Causal lens. One minor slip: the lacquered chest opens by convenient storm-jolt, a touch of coincidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The stormlit observatory is tactile—pitted iron, humming tubes, bruised-indigo glass—and constrains every move: the portico frames visions, the static is the medium, the spire groans under wind. The cobalt glow becomes a beacon for the settlements, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—will Elian choose a shadow master or forge a third dawn?—tightens when the duet of contradictory futures screams from the receiver. The map’s third path narrows options and forces the costly broadcast. Pressure is coherent; the price (loss of spectral patronage, risk of failure) is felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the seductive danger of external salvation versus self-authored hope. The cobalt glow, the static’s sorrow, and the star-map’s alien constellations all reconfigure in the final sunlight without moralizing. The ending’s non-literal answer—“a dawn built by human hands”—resonates without didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in sensory grit: “tasted of ozone and regret,” “spitting lightning and rain.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses under storm-fury, longer breaths at revelation. No POV drift; the perceptual signature remains Elian’s haunted technician-poet stance throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; every sentence advances image or stakes. Minor loop: “lightning clawed…strobing, violent bursts” borders on over-description, but the rhythm serves the storm’s crescendo. No mixed metaphors or register drift. The final line’s cadence crystallizes the reconfiguration cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of radio-prophecy, stormbound hermit, and star-map third path feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes (lonely visionary, spectral voices) are transformed through cobalt glass physics and the gritty whimsy of “shatter the old loyalties.” The risk of lyric abstraction is balanced by tactile detail.</comment>
