<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses (hope vs dread) play out in micro-choices—clicking the watch, repositioning in mist, trembling transcription. The final “Stay” lands as earned renunciation with visible cost: the dissolving library and stilling watch foreclose return. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each decoded phrase layers density until the single radiant word reweights all prior material. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—library dissolves, path foreclosed, cost felt in the hush after the watch stops. Orientation anchored by 3rd paragraph; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glowing library is not backdrop but active constraint: mist density dictates positioning, light-mote delays force triangulation. Watch as micro-setting constrains tactics and charges the final image when it falls still. Sensory selection stays urgent and POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the unspoken word before the second letter—tightens with each decoded phrase; the final “Stay” crystallizes the cost of knowledge. Escalation is accumulative: every solved fragment increases emotional pressure until the library dissolves, foreclosing further search.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken regret emerges organically from the cipher mechanics; “Stay” offers a non-literal, resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext lives in the reversed watch and the mist’s delayed light—silence made visible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—pearlescent sea, cathedral of regret—remains anchored in Elara’s perceptual bias. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences in wonder, clipped fragments during transcription. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, choice, or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective and purposeful—“dying star” for “Stay” crystallizes closure without clutter. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: regret-as-propagation-delay is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure pays off in the final reweighting. Specificity of the reversed watch and light-mote cipher prevents trope drift.</comment>
