<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning to speak yet fearing capture—drives every micro-choice; the final poem is a costly renunciation that forecloses her freedom. Kael’s brief presence adds relational pressure that tightens her resolve. Motivation stays rooted in artistic identity, never drifting into abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the canyon’s shattered echo rewrites the Absolution’s rule-set, with Elara’s arrest the visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each whispered line layers density until the final cadence shift breaks the forged hush. Orientation is anchored by the second sentence; no drift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bone-canyon’s acoustics are not backdrop but instrument, constraining how Elara crafts refracted sound; the pale spire reappears as charged image at the end. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered—“marrow-paths,” “skeletal archway”—with no static cataloguing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—the price of forgiveness—tightens once: from whispered doubt to irreversible sonic fracture. The single deepening is sufficient; Elara’s agency drives the escalation, and the cost (imminent capture) is legible on the final line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the concrete act of fracturing sound; no moralizing statement intrudes. The ending’s shattered echo offers a non-literal answer—truth as multiplicity—without declaring it. Subtext lives in gesture: the innocently mischievous delivery masking mortal risk.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; syntax mirrors the canyon’s echoing cadence. “Forged hush” and “bone-latticed city” feel invented yet inevitable. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is taut, rhythmic, and information-dense; each image advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops, mixed metaphors, or scaffold. The final stanza’s controlled enjambment propels the beat without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—ritualized silence enforced by bone architecture—feels fresh; the transformation of echo into rebellion is non-obvious yet inevitable. Specificity of the canyon’s acoustics and the Absolution’s dogma grounds the concept. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
