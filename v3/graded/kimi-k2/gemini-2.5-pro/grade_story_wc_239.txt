<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied (“she felt the truth of it in the air”), but the Witness’s contradictory impulses remain largely abstract; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a crystallized Resonant Reconfiguration: the dictionary falls, the self dissolves, and the hush absorbs her—cost is the extinction of individuality. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; spiral pattern taught early and fulfilled in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Obsidian floor, “resounding hush,” and the dictionary as micro-setting all constrain the final act; the temple’s silence is not backdrop but active force. One hairline slip: spatial anchors could be one degree sharper for 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unifying with the resolved cosmos—is signaled early and tightens through the walk; the final letting-go forecloses all other paths. Cost is conceptual rather than tangible, capping at 8.4.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic resolution emerges from the spiral motion and silence; no moralizing, only the charged image of the falling book. Final hush reweights every prior word without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, controlled, and consistent; perceptual signature (“wanderingly exact spiral”) is distinct. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; only minor scaffold (“a place lost not in space, but…”) and one mixed metaphor (“universe’s hiccup”) keep it from 9+. No artifacts in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-cosmic-archive and spiral-as-resolution; the dictionary-as-key is transformed from mundane to ontological. Risky lyric mode fully commits and lands.</comment>
