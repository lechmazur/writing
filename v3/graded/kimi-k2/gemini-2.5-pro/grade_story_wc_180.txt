<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the quartz-eye, the ribbon, and the seed all act as extensions of his contradictory impulses. The final choice to bind rather than seal is earned by prior micro-choices and carries visible cost (leaving the ribbon behind). The only drag is a brief “accidental wisdom” label that edges toward diagnostic speak, but it is immediately dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ribbon’s loose binding crystallizes a new stance toward change. Causal linkage holds—each beat (frustration, discovery, re-vision, act) tightens options under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the final image: the ribbon abandoned, the future uncontrolled.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The cathedral-orchard is not backdrop; its living rafters and mossy nave constrain access and dictate Elian’s climb. The ribbon and seed function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. One minor spatial wobble—“immense branch” to “vaulted heights”—but coherence recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save the Heartwood—tightens once when Elian realizes the fracture is germination, not damage. Agency drives the escalation: he abandons archaic tools and chooses support over repair. The cost (loss of certainty, of the ribbon) is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>“Deciduous vows” evolves from abstract theme to embodied practice; the seed inside the crystal literalizes the idea without sermonizing. The final image reweights the premise: vows that heal by letting go. No late moralizing; resonance emerges from the ribbon’s blue prayer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, tactile, and consistent: “scent of apple blossoms and damp stone,” “discordant hum.” Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off. One brief register lift—“conceptual repricing” in interiority—feels slightly academic, but the perceptual signature remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; every sentence advances stakes or atmosphere. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short bursts during the climb, longer breaths during reflection. Only a single filter-verb cluster (“he felt”) in a low-pressure beat; no closure interference.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The orchard-cathedral and quartz-eye mender synthesize familiar tropes into a fresh, specific world. The ribbon-seed reversal feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious. Risk-taking (living architecture, deciduous vows as literal method) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
