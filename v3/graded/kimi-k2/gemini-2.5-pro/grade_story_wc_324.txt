<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s curiosity is embodied in his methodical tuning of the obsolete aid and his deliberate steps; the final “assure” action is a direct expression of his protective motive. Leo’s worry is viscerally shown through posture and breath, not labels. The cost—Elias’s quiet exit without acclaim—feels earned. Minor deduction for Leo’s worry being slightly generic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene causal arc: dead call → Elias traces → locates Leo → translates pulse → call answered. Orientation is immediate (mist-clad atrium, twilight). Closure is a Charged Poise: the signal fades, Leo’s stance softens, Elias leaves—cost is the solitude he accepts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The atrium’s glass-and-steel echo chamber literally guides Elias’s steps; the fountain acts as spatial pivot. Fog and benches create hush that amplifies the pulse. Setting constrains visibility and sound, shaping the search. Micro-setting (aid in palm) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: can Elias translate Elara’s pulse into peace for Leo? Escalation is the pulse’s frantic rise → steady lullaby; Elias’s agency is the act of assurance that narrows Leo’s despair to calm. Cost is the vanishing signal—connection severed once peace is delivered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges: grief is a signal to be decoded, not silenced. Subtext in the shared photograph and matching pulses avoids overt statement. Final image—Elias walking back into mist—reweights heroism as quiet service. No moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s sensory filter: “reeling hush,” “moth fluttering.” Diction is precise and rhythmic (“echoes went to die,” “paper-thin map”). No head-hopping; Leo’s interior is read through posture and breath, maintaining distance.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence advances image or beat. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“cathedral of glass,” “moth fluttering”) are fresh and integrated. Rhythm modulates with tension—short pulses mirror heartbeat. Minor over-modification in “utter defeat” but forgivable.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>“Contact tracer for hearts” is a fresh conceit executed with tactile rigor. The obsolete hearing aid as spirit radio feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Incidental heroism subverts savior tropes: Elias exits unnamed. Specificity of Elara’s 87-year gap and beige aid grounds the fantastical.</comment>
