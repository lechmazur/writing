<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—ritualized reinvention vs. the need to speak Lena’s name—are dramatized in the storm beat and the final gift. Interiority is embodied (dust-maps, meteorite in palm) and the micro-choice to hand Anna the scroll carries visible cost. The only drag is a slight over-articulation of grief in the “withering” paragraph. Still, the final stance crystallizes with earned weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s renunciation of fabricated histories is dramatized by the literal handing-over of the scroll. Causal linkage holds—storm → leak → tarp → trust → confession → gift—each beat tightening options. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of lies dissolves into one truthful act. Cost is legible in the raw voice and the relinquished monopoly on Lena’s song.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The attic skylight, dust column, and meteorite function as micro-setting that constrains balance and later charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful; rain’s trajectory directly threatens the paper trail. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift. One minor slip: “mouldering” feels generic amid otherwise sharp detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve Lena’s music—faces a concrete test when water snakes toward the scores. Escalation is one decisive tightening: storm forces Elias to act, which forces truth. Agency is present in tarp, stool, and final gift; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is felt in the relinquished secrecy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclamation vs. erasure emerges through the dust-map ritual and the meteorite’s reweighted meaning. Subtext operates in the silent gift of the scroll. Final image offers non-literal answer: sharing the impossible is the only way to keep it. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in Anna’s unread smile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature is Elias’s astronomer-poet diction. Compression and elision are taught early (“tracked comets from a mountaintop in Chile”) and paid off in the final truth. Dialogue is spare, natural, and subtext-laden. One minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” moment risks elevated diction but stays within plausible grief-voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; sentences advance multiple jobs. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long lyrical lines collapse into short, raw confession. No loops, no mixed metaphors. One near-scaffold: “quiet, desperate act” could trim, but it occurs early and does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Pigeon-courier of lost sheet music is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The meteorite as “piece of impossible” transforms from lie to gift without gimmickry. Specificity of attic dust-maps and cooing wicker cage anchors universals. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final scroll hand-off.</comment>
