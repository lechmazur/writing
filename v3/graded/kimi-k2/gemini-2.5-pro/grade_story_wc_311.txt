<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael’s grief is embodied in the dust motes, the prism, the crystal—never stated. The contradictory impulse to “anchor an echo” rather than sever a soul is dramatized in the final beat, with visible cost: the shard is a scar, not a cure. Interiority is precise, character-bound, and drives the single decisive act. Only the “nameless fear” line edges toward label-speak, keeping it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystal crystallizes both Elara’s echo and Kael’s stance, foreclosing the path of endless mourning. Causal chain is tight: recordings → grief → atlas metaphor → crystallization. Orientation is immediate; no drift. The cost is legible in the shard’s fractures and the phrase “he was still a heartbroken reaper.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The copper-ribbed observatory, dusk light, and prism are not backdrop; they supply the literal mechanics of crystallization and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the tear-shaped lens fragment) constrains the only possible action. Sensory detail is selective—apricot and violet light, dust motes freezing—filtered through Kael’s spectral perception. One more tactile anchor inside the crystal would push it to 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: to give shape to grief without being consumed. Pressure tightens once: the decision to crystallize the echo narrows options from passive mourning to active anchoring. Cost is visible—the shard is a scar—and alters Kael’s stance. Agency is interior but decisive; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the fusion of astronomy and grief: starlight as memory, sacrifice as uncharted sea monster. The atlas page’s monsters are not symbols but a working metaphor Kael literalizes. Final image reweights the premise: absence can be held, not healed. No moralizing; resonance is earned through specific objects and actions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is spectral, precise, and cadenced: “the silence now was his own, hollowed out.” Syntax lengthens under grief, then compresses during crystallization. Perceptual signature is consistent—Kael notices dust, light angles, fracture lines. No POV drift; diction stays within a reaper’s mythic register. Distinctive without ornament.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid: “dust motes ceased their dance and were drawn inward” does triple duty—image, causality, emotional state. No loops, no scaffold. Metaphors are integrated (copper-ribbed skeleton, captive nebula) and physically coherent. One minor filter-verb cluster (“he held… he pressed… he willed”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusing star-reaper cosmology with cartography of grief feels inevitable and fresh. The atlas page’s sea monsters transform from decorative myth to functional map of sorrow. Risk—crystallizing an echo instead of a soul—pays off without gimmickry. Specificity of the shard as “a scar given form” is unforgettable.</comment>
