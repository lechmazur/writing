<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“driftwood nostalgia,” “quiet obsession that hummed beneath her ribs”), and her micro-choice to uncap the vial is credibly motivated by prior fragments and family legacy. The final image of “tired woman watching a miracle” crystallizes earned cost. Minor slip: the contradictory impulse between fear of failure and compulsion to repair is implied rather than dramatized in-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the Orrery restarts, dawn arrives, and the mirrors collapse to one true reflection. Causal chain—prophecy scraps → eclipse vial → gear key → Orrery motion—holds without gaps. Cost is visible in the “tired woman” image and the irrevocable use of the last eclipse essence. Lens is Causal; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The frozen library, hall of mirrors, and Orrery frost are not mere backdrop; the “hauntingly bright” glare actively blinds and forces Elara to invent the eclipse tactic. Spatial choreography is clean, and the mirrors’ dissolution into one reflection charges the final image. Micro-setting (obsidian vial) constrains the decisive action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the Orrery or remain in perpetual twilight—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: the blinding light forces the eclipse gambit, foreclosing all other solutions. Cost is the irreversible expenditure of the last eclipse essence and the psychic weight of countless failed selves. Agency remains with Elara throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of repair as self-repair emerges organically from Elara’s actions; the Orrery’s restart mirrors her internal reconciliation. Subtext operates in the mirrors’ silent screams and the final warm light. No moralizing; the ending image of “quiet, powerful harmony” reweights the premise without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“silver arms and planetary gems coated in a frost that was hauntingly bright”). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices through touch and temperature, not sight, until the eclipse. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and function. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent (“water-smoothed wood,” “shed skin”). One near-miss: “hauntingly bright” is repeated twice in close proximity, a minor artifact that does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith conceit is fresh, and the eclipse-as-key twist feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of the obsidian vial and crescent gear prevents generic fantasy drift. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image.</comment>
