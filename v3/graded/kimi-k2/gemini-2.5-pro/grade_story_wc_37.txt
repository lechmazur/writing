<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her “shattered reflection” mind and “heavy cloak” duty anchor motivation. Micro-choices (tending plants, coaxing buds) reveal values and escalate stakes. The final renunciation—singing the song at personal cost—earns closure. Flaw: memory shards feel convenient rather than contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single continuous scene under Accumulative/Textural lens; each plant-care beat yields a lyric fragment that tightens toward the dawn-weaving climax. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the nascent sun’s “tender warmth” reconfigures the realm and her mind with visible cost—she is now “whole” yet still a constrained vessel. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s humid flagstones, Moon-Petal pollens, and mica window constrain every move; the Lumina tree’s droop sets the ticking clock. Sensory hierarchy filters through Elara’s caretaker bias. Final image of distorted glass turning dawn into “abstract painting” recharges setting as both canvas and cage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore sunrise or lose realm and self—intensifies as each plant-care micro-beat yields a lyric fragment, narrowing options to the final song. Cost is felt: she must surrender her fractured self to become the vessel. No external antagonist; pressure is accumulative and coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of communal weaving emerges through plant-fae symbiosis and song-as-binding-magic; no explicit moralizing. Subtext in “thread of silver, strand of gold” quietly links memory, duty, and dawn. Final image of “perfect dawn” reframes prior darkness without tidy resolution—cost remains. Slight abstraction in “dying realm” weakens specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrid prose with controlled compression—“phosphorescence hanging in the air” reads as caretaker’s trained eye. Syntax modulates: longer humid sentences early, clipped final verse. No dialogue; interior monologue stays within plausible lexicon. Patterned elision of memory shards is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>High information density—“gossamer-winged Petal-Moths” does world-building and stakes in four words. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“nascent sun”) fits mythic register. Clean grammar and spatial tracking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar “last keeper revives world-tree” frame is transformed through alchemical botany and song-weaving mechanics. Specificity of Sun-Drop Fern and Shadow-Vine grounds the myth. Risk: lyric mode could tip into cliché, but disciplined sensory choice keeps it fresh.</comment>
