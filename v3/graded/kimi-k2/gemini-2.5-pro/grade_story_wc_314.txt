<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—icy logic vs. hidden sentiment—drives every beat; the locket reveal and flame choice crystallize cost. Embodied emotion (“cold and sharp frustration,” “hands suddenly steady”) anchors the shift. The final renunciation of pure reason is earned by prior causality and felt in the sublimation image.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (waterfall light, murmuration, crystal vapor) tightens the stake until the final cadence shift. Closure lands as Charged Poise—logic and intuition fused—at visible cost: the crystal’s irreversible vanishing. No orientation drift; all anchors clear by 90 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard, waterfall, and gnarled apple tree are not backdrop; they guide Elias’s gaze and supply the crystal. Micro-setting (locket, leaf, flame) constrains the decisive act. Sensory selection stays urgent and POV-filtered; the final vapor recharges the initial rainbow light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harmonize logic and intuition—signaled early and tightened once by the starling arrow. The flame offering is a deliberate, costly act that forecloses the path of pure analysis. Pressure grows via pattern density, not external antagonist; cost is the irretrievable crystal and the surrender of intellectual certainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the crystal’s vanishing is the non-literal answer to the opening question. No moralizing; the resonance is in the sensory afterimage (“scent of ancient ice and new blossoms”). Ambiguity remains—wonder now cohabits with logic—without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: alchemical precision in diction (“tinctures and distillates”) modulates to lyric awe under pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens as focus softens. Rhythm mirrors emotional arc—measured clauses yield to flowing cadence at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Zero loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful (“living arrow,” “dark river in the sky”). Strong verbs and sensory nouns carry load; no register drift. Final image is clean, propulsive, and artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: alchemist’s lab meets murmuration divination, grounded in tactile detail. The starling-grimoire link feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk in the quiet, interior climax pays off; no derivative templates. Specificity of the pressed edelweiss and sublimating crystal renders the premise unrepeatable.</comment>
