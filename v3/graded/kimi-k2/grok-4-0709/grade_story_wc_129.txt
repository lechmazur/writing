<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lirah’s bold sympathy is embodied in concrete choices—offering reed talismans, pausing to comfort searchers—so the trait drives action. Interior contradiction surfaces only lightly; her loneliness is stated more than dramatized. The final grafting into community is earned by the shared search and the arbor she sculpts, carrying visible cost in obsidian shards gathered at peril. Still, the emotional layering could be sharper under peak stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor crystallizes Lirah’s acceptance and the community’s reconfigured web. Causality holds—each tag fragment found tightens the weave and narrows Lirah’s isolation—until the final image reweights the premise with communal embrace. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph; no drift. The cost is legible in the luminescent ache that transforms into shared strength.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and crater’s shimmer constrain movement (perilous ledge, fumes) and supply the obsidian shards that become the arbor. Sensory detail is selective—quartz fruits, glow-veins—filtered through Lirah’s sculptor eye. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the search. The setting’s glimmer mirrors internal ache without overt symbolism, charging the final arbor image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging versus isolation—is signaled early and tightens with each tag fragment found, foreclosing Lirah’s outsider status. Agency is collective yet Lirah’s bold sympathy steers the search; the final arbor is her decisive act that seals the graft. Cost is visible in the perilous climb and the ache of remembered losses. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of kinship as living web emerges through the search ritual and the arbor’s creation, never stated didactically. Subtext lives in gestures, reed talismans, and shared silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the obsidian arbor refracts starlight into communal memory. Complexity is honored—belonging carries the same ache as isolation, now shared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates during the ledge scene and breathes during communal nights. Perceptual signature is consistent—Lirah notices texture, curvature, and light like a sculptor. No dialogue appears; the prose carries subtext through image and gesture. No POV drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is selective—no purple stacks. Occasional lyrical repetition (“luminescent ache”) is pattern-taught early and pays off in closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Opening and closing lines are sharp, the final image crystallizing prior motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The premise—wordless post-cataclysm community rebuilding kinship through art—feels fresh, synthesized through Lirah’s reed craft and the obsidian arbor. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss. The crystalline orchard, crater fumes, and tag fragments cohere into a singular vision. Transformation test passes: swap any element and the arc breaks.</comment>
