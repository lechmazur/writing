<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses—yearning to repair yet fearing exposure—surface in the micro-choice to kneel and etch snow-codes; the pillbox hand-off crystallizes a visible cost (trust, exposure). Interiority is embodied, not labeled. Mira’s presence supplies relational pressure that alters their shared state. The final renunciation of solitude is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias parts with the microfilm, foreclosing solo redemption. Causal chain—coded snow → melt → safe-house map—holds under Situational lens; coincidence (spring thaw) complicates, not resolves. Orientation is anchored by word 60. One transition (Mira’s arrival) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bluff’s mist and thawing snow constrain tactics: transient medium for codes, natural concealment, ticking melt-clock. Sensory detail is selective (silver hush, glistening drifts) and filtered through Elias’s wary gaze. Environment charges the final image as footprints fade into spring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mend the shattered agent network—tightens when the only safe conduit is vanishing snow. One decisive deepening: handing over the pillbox relinquishes sole control, visible cost etched in the closing mist. Pressure coheres under situational lens; no off-stage rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of “unused courage” emerges through the quiet act of trusting Mira and the ephemeral snow-code; no moralizing. Subtext lives in the pillbox’s weight and the unspoken history between the spies. Final image reweights the premise: courage is found in relinquishing, not seizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is restrained, weathered, fitting a burned spy; perceptual signature notices wind-shift and thaw with professional alertness. Syntax modulates with tension—longer lyrical lines in calm, clipped fragments as Mira arrives. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet atmospheric; figurative language (“mists clung like forgotten secrets”) is sparse and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm breathes with scene tempo. Occasional elevated diction (“vouchsafe”) is justified by Elias’s formal past.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: spy tradecraft meets transient snow as cipher. The pillbox-as-relic trope is retooled into a data key. Risk-taking in the self-erasing message heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of Zephyr Bluff and spring thaw anchors universals.</comment>
