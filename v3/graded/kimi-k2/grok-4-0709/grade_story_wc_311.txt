<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reaper’s interiority is vivid—his grief is embodied in the “weight of a love reaped too soon”—but the contradictory impulses (duty vs. love) are stated rather than dramatized in real time. The final act of naming crystallizes his arc, yet the cost feels more narrated than lived. Still, the voice is specific and the micro-choice (adjusting mirrors to trap light) is character-bound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the reaper’s ritual reconfigures his grief into named crystals, a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost—“solace in the dusk’s embrace” forecloses further pursuit of the beloved. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each echo crystallizes because the mirrors gather light, not coincidence. Orientation is secure by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory’s prisms and cracked dome are not mere backdrop; they are the tools that refract light into the ritual, constraining how the reaper can act. The atlas page itself becomes a micro-setting whose monsters absorb the crystals, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—no static tour.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming nameless dread into bearable grief—is signaled early and tightens through each crystallization. Agency is exercised in the mirror adjustments; each shard narrows the reaper’s emotional options. Cost is visible in the “shattered” heart that remains, but the escalation is more lyrical than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of sacrifice as echo emerges organically from the recordings and the reaper’s own enforced loss; no moral is stated. The final constellation of named fears offers a non-literal answer: grief can be mapped but never undone. Subtext resides in the silence after the scream, not exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, elevated yet restrained—“distant intimacy” achieved through hushed diction and rhythmic control. No dialogue appears, so none is needed. The perceptual signature is the reaper’s star-haunted detachment, maintained throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without purple overload; metaphors like “guardians of the deep fears” serve the moment. No loops or scaffold detected. Sentence rhythm modulates with the ritual’s crescendo, then subsides into the quiet final line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The fusion of reaper myth with antique observatory science feels fresh; the crystallization of spoken echoes into grief-artifacts is a novel ritual. Tropes (sorrowful psychopomp, starlit sanctuary) are transformed through tactile specificity rather than ornament.</comment>
