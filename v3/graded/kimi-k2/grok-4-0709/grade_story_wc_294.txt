<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s calm is embodied in micro-choices (the silent boundary ritual) and carries a visible cost—he forfeits direct confrontation. Interiority is specific, but the father-legacy conflict is more summarized than dramatized in-scene, muting contradictory impulses at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the territorial-marker gambit crystallizes Elias’s stance and reweights the cycle question with felt cost (the spent foreign bills). Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; one transition (rise/fall montage) is cleanly handled.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The circus train is tactile—peeling paint, string lights, lion-tamer’s car—yet its decay subtly constrains Elias’s tactics (the boundary ritual uses the train’s skin). Final image of fluttering bills against rusted metal recharges the setting with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—why paths loop—tightens when Victor arrives; Elias’s non-violent dissuasion forecloses retaliation but costs irreplaceable currency. Pressure escalates through pattern break (from digital success to physical defense) rather than causal reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical return emerges from Elias’s lived particulars—robber’s son, startup collapse, boundary ritual—without moralizing. Final image of foreign bills as territorial flags reweights the premise: wealth as transient boundary, not escape.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is dusk-hushed, syntactically controlled; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elias’s calm lens. No dialogue, yet free-indirect texture stays coherent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“perceptive weight”) nicks authenticity but doesn’t rupture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; only minor scaffold (“once vibrant… now squatted”) and one mixed metaphor (“double-edged blade” of legacy). No loops or register drift in peak beats; final cadence breathes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: frontier outlaw heritage meets predictive-tech startup, resolved through circus-train boundary ritual. Specificity of foreign bills as territorial markers feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Minor risk in compressed rise/fall montage pays off.</comment>
