<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias functions consistently as both observer and actor whose final guardianship of the box crystallizes stakes; his astonishment is embodied, not token. Static conflicts and beat overlap cap the grade shy of excellence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The distributed causality between ghosts, covenant, and box holds through the inferred Situational lens, landing a quiet but embodied closure with visible restraint. Minor orientation lag at the oasis whip-pan.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The beekeeping wreckage is tactile and re-enters choices (swarm guarding the box), constraining Elias’s final move. Generic weather filler and mid-capsule lesson keep it short of the 9 gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The covenant pressure tightens visibly when ghost-Mira’s presence demands Elias choose covenant preservation; cost is on the page, but single escalation beat centered on him caps score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the covenant’s quiet preservation vs vanished speech, reconfiguring the story’s emotional weight without moralizing. The mute final gesture is resonant, yet residual abstraction trims the top.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tranquil-perceptive interiority is distinct in syntax and detail, balanced by quiet external draft. One imperfect pronoun drift mid-paragraph nicks precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lines muscular and dense, rarely decorative. A single metaphor lapse (“veil torn like heat” inside “heat haze”) and one scaffold repetition pull it below 8. Read-aloud rhythm taut.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The fusion of desert beekeeping and ghost covenant feels concept-specific, yet the whisper-medium trope is common. Risks are measured, closing on a hushed echo rather than unforeseen revelation.</comment>
