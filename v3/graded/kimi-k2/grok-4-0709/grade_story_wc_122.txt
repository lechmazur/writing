<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—yearning for connection while deaf—drives every micro-choice; the moment he feels vibrations through the floor and adjusts the phonograph for Mira crystallizes his arc. The shared tapping on the drum shows embodied emotion without therapy-speak. Cost is visible: he trades isolation for the risk of reopening feeling. Secondary pressure from Mira is minimal but sufficient for the length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each backward-spinning record layers density until the final “filament of hush” reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s stance shifts from numbness to quiet conduit—felt in the lingering silence after Mira’s tears. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the closing image: the cavern’s breath held, a charged poise that forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The cavern’s resonant stone and half-made drums physically transmit vibrations that Elias reads as emotion; the drum stool Mira touches becomes micro-setting that alters rhythm. Seasonal rustle outside mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean; tools and records remain consistently placed. Environment constrains choice: only this hollowed space can amplify hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when Mira’s arrival forces Elias to test his method on another. One meaningful deepening: the reversed lullaby cracks her grief, proving the filament’s power and raising the cost of continuing. Agency is Elias’s decision to layer another song, widening the risk. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal and accumulative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of music into hush: silence becomes a carrier of feeling. The final image—filament lingering in every heart—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture: Mira’s silent tears, Elias’s tightening chest. No thematic drift; complexity is preserved in the paradox that absence of sound restores emotion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the reversed songs: “faint, reversed whispers that seemed to pull sound inward.” Perceptual signature is Elias’s tactile noticing of vibration and hush. No dialogue, so no register clash. Compression and patterned elision (“mirrored hush”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Figurative language is selective—“voice swallowed by fog”—and never muddles. No loops or scaffold; “filament of hush” recurs with reweighted meaning. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—deaf teacher using broken phonograph to spin records backward for emotional healing—is fresh and fully committed. Transformation test fails if names change; the specificity of deafness, reversed sound, and cavern acoustics is integral. Risk in the experimental sound device pays off by charging the closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
