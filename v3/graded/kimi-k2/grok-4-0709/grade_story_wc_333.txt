<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s longing and the lock of hair anchor every beat; the final renunciation—offering the hair as key—carries visible cost. Interiority is embodied (“tears mingled with the hush”) rather than labeled. The only minor slip is a touch of therapeutic self-diagnosis in “mend the rift in his soul,” but it does not derail the earned closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the portal opens and Mira’s voice absolves, but Elias remains alone—cost is felt. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: starlight density increases, ribbon unthreads, and the final image crystallizes meaning. Orientation is taught early; the disorientation is functional and paid off. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The nexus’s stone arches and pooled starlight constrain Elias’s kneeling gesture, charging the final portal image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“liquid silver” under his knees). Micro-setting—the lock of hair on stone—functions as setting and tool. One minor spatial vagueness in “shadowed vines” keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing Mira’s trapped idea—is signaled early and tightened when Elias must surrender the last relic. Agency drives escalation: he chooses to offer the hair, narrowing his future. Cost is visible—loss of the physical remnant and of reunion. Coincidence (star’s timing) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of fear as cocoon emerges through action, never statement. The lock of hair shifts from memento to key, reweighting its meaning. Final image—portal shimmering but empty—offers resonant, non-moral answer. One slight drift toward abstraction in “touched the eternal” nudges it below 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled; patterned elision (“the hush of cosmic possibility”) is taught early and paid off. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during disorientation, longer cadences in reflection. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Elias. Occasional elevated diction (“enveloped secrets”) fits the cosmic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is selective. One mixed metaphor—“time stretched like a vast, silent canvas” beside “time looped in impossible knots”—momentarily jars, but clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The locksmith-who-unlocks-fear is a fresh synthesis of familiar tropes. The hair-as-key and star-hint mechanics feel inevitable in hindsight. Specificity—“faded ribbon,” “stone arches twisted like frozen lightning”—grounds the cosmic frame. Risk in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
