<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lanara’s motives and dual allegiance are articulated with specificity, embodied in the graffiti code choices and the talisman ritual. Emotions are anchored in micro-decisions — she rubs the chip before spraying, bridges alliances with stories not slogans, and the final stance crystallizes without tidy resolution. A tangible cost (risk of eviction if discovered) is implied but never dramatized on page, holding her just short of highest tier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural night gathers disparate castes, foreclosing passive reliance on outsiders and reweaving Raftoria’s social fabric. Causality holds throughout; every earlier graffiti command reaps an on-page consequence (communal markets, protective collectives). Cost — potential loss of the carnival forever — is conceptual but sharp, and the foundation stone embedded in the wall is the keystone image that finalises the change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The raft city is never static: currents shift vendor routes, polished yachts alter skyline silhouettes midway, lantern reflections ride chipped water under the mural. Specific environmental constraints guide graffiti placement decisions; the perpetual carnival’s sensory overload is harnessed, not described for its own sake. The foundation stone chip satisfies micro-setting criteria by charging the final communal gathering.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>The dominant stake is gentrification’s advance versus communal survival; pressure tightens as corporate buyout dates are announced and resources dwindle. Lanara’s encoded graffiti is the agency that turns looming loss into cooperative buys; each message escalates risk (graffiti could be read by the envoys). Price is made visceral when a crowd forms, aware eviction may be days away, yet chooses collective action anyway.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: communal ownership versus commodified joy, explored through image (chipped ancient stone) and tactic (collaborative guilds) not speech. No character ever articulates the moral; instead the mural’s encoded history reweights the meaning in the final lantern-glow moment. Hopeful desperation is the pulse beneath every beat; its cost is the fragile dawn, never stated, always flickering.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Lanara’s perceptual signature: she maps rafts in mental grids, fingers the chip’s sharp edge, gauges wall textures while spraying. Compression and patterned repetition (“night after night”) become ritual rhythm, the prose modulating with emotional pitch. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven: whispered alliances carry subtext. No unmotivated POV drift occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Prose is tight and textured; sensory verbs replace modifiers (raft walls “bob,” scents “waft,” chips “gleam”). Metaphors are restrained and specific (“storm clouds of buyouts”). Few scaffolding phrases appear; the single paraphrase loop (“hopeful desperation” used twice) is intentional cadence reinforcement. Rhythm heightens during the climactic night without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>The carnival-raft premise is familiar if taken alone, but grafted onto the corporate-gentrification arc with the graffiti-as-resistance tactic, the story achieves fresh synthesis. The ancient stone chip repurposed as modern talisman, and graffiti code becoming choreography, are non-obvious moves that feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
