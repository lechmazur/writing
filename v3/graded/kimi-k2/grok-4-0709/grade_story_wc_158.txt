<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elowen’s insomnia and longing are vivid, but centuries of stasis flatten interior contradiction; the final reunion feels gifted rather than earned by micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lullabies layer into living tapestries, reweighting pain into beauty. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“pain fully photosynthesized”—with centuries of vigilance as visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The shell’s acoustics and reef-shadow light constrain the lullaby method and charge the final image; postcard pulses in response, binding setting to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—end centuries of longing—escalates via cumulative song layers; cost is the unbroken vigil itself, but agency is more patient than active.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmuting pain into beauty emerges through the blossom armistice; final reunion reweights prior suffering without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, oceanic cadence sustains a singular perceptual signature; patterned elision (“shyly unstoppable”) is taught early and pays off in the hush of reunion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rich figurative density occasionally drifts toward purple (“petals unfurling in colors borrowed from nebulae”), but rhythm remains purposeful and no loops obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of cosmic postcard, shell cathedral, and photosynthetic poetics feels fresh; centuries-long lullaby siege is a non-obvious solution to immortal grief.</comment>
