<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s gentle ethos and “beauty in the incomplete” motive drive every choice, culminating in the feather-rescue beat. Micro-choices (kneeling, verses, slotting the feather) reveal hierarchy of values with felt cost. Quiet endurance earns credible closure, but interiority slips toward lyric summary under peak stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Built as accumulative/textural; each lyrical beat layers density toward the feather healing scene, which reweights the dawn concept with visible cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear by line 4. Closure—drake rising, dawn re-woven in flawed glory—lands on the page as Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lagoon and storm-washed cove anchor space and mood, feeding Elias’s metaphors and constraining any escape paths. Mist and “polished sapphire” surface are filter-heavy yet thematically tuned to incomplete light. Micro-setting (hollowed rock alcove) enables the healing scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Central tension is restoring the wounded drake; pressure tightens when Elias must harmonize internal pain with external song. Single meaningful turn: feather re-insertion mends dawn’s weave and forecloses his earlier solitude. Cost—drake flies scarred yet luminous—is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The beauty-in-the-incomplete theme emerges through the scarred drake’s flight rather than statement; the final image reweights motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity is coherent—flawed dawn still holds promise. Quiet ending satisfies as Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The prose adopts a burnished lyric cadence that tracks Elias’s patient attention under pressure. Sensory filter remains character-bound (“fresh petrichor”, “whispers of mist”). Compression under peak tension is controlled—no loops, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Metaphoric density occasionally clutters the crisis breath (“tapestries woven of morning”), muddling cause-and-effect clarity. Rhythm is strong elsewhere; no loops or scaffold. Late third carries artifacts that blunt propulsion toward 9+ territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Breathes new life into the wounded-guardian trope through a poet lens and flawed dawn flight. Synthesis feels inevitable—solitude into stewardship—though lyric mode is familiar. Specificity of tail-feather mechanics and burnished scars mark individual vision.</comment>
