<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s quiet fire and pragmatic cunning are embodied in every micro-choice—feigned surrender, nightly poultices, marble rituals—so motivation stays legible and intensifies. The interior contradiction (deceiver turned healer) is dramatized, not labeled. Closure cost is felt: he wins the garden but remains branded low-luck, a social exile. Only the villagers’ off-stage scoffing keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the maze’s blooming vines physically twine around Elias while villagers’ amulets flicker in confusion—undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: feigned defeat → Thorne’s blundering → Elias’s covert healing → public vindication. One transition (dawn ceremony) is clean. No orientation drift; anchors set by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The maze’s “shadowed heart” and “forgotten corners” are not backdrop but tactical terrain—Elias exploits Thorne’s ignorance of hidden paths and wildflower pouches. Central vine’s final blossoms physically embrace Elias, charging the image. Sensory detail is selective (moonlit marble, frost-bitten leaf) and filtered through gardener’s eye. Meets 9+ gate: setting constrains choice and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prove care transcends luck—is signaled early and tightened when Thorne’s perfect-ten amulet begins to dip. Escalation is causal: each covert pruning narrows Thorne’s options and raises Elias’s exposure. One decisive turn: public revelation with garden as witness. Cost is visible—social ostracism persists even in victory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: deception repurposed into stewardship, luck metrics undermined by living proof. No moralizing; final declaration is earned spectacle. Subtext in cracked marbles—lies polished into testament—reweights earlier betrayal. Resonance lingers in the image of blossoms defying frost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is gnarled, patient, tactile—“skin like dried bark,” “hands gnarled”—consistent with Elias’s vocation. Syntax lengthens in calm, compresses under stealth. No dialogue, so free indirect style carries subtext. Occasional lyric lift (“tendrils reaching like grateful arms”) stays within gardener’s idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; each sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful—no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with stealth vs. ceremony. Minor scaffold in “whispered of withering” echo, but does not dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Luck-as-currency premise is fresh, but the real ingenuity is using cracked marbles—childhood deceit turned ritual tool—to embody mended deception. Garden-as-character subverts quantified fate without didacticism. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; risk (quiet triumph over spectacle) heightens stakes.</comment>
