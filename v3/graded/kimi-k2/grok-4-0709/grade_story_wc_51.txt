<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Weaver’s motive—collecting burdens to balance her own—is clear and embodied in ritual action; interiority stays concrete (“her form shimmering like a mandelbrot mirage”). Yet the traveler’s regret is sketched generically, and the weaver’s contradictory impulse (to free herself by deepening her own recursion) is asserted more than dramatized, keeping her from full individuality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a decisive change: the boundary-less trap calcifies into finite form and she steps free. Causal chain holds—each calcified weight tightens the meta-pattern until the loom itself becomes the prison she hardens. Cost is visible: the lamp’s final flare consumes its last oil, sealing release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Bronze grotto, starlight geometry, and lamp-grid together constrain every weaving choice; the crystal shard’s refraction literally orients the loom. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the weaver’s urgent focus. The setting evolves: thaw-drips fade as dawn lifts the hush, marking time’s passage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape from infinite recursion—is signaled early and escalates through each calcification. Each new stone narrows options until the meta-pattern forces the final self-weave. Cost is cumulative: every burden taken on tightens her own trap before it finally breaks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of recursion versus finitude emerges from the weaver’s ritual, not exposition. The calcified weights reweight the premise: what was abstract burden becomes literal counterweight, letting the infinite collapse into bounded form. Final image of her absence in the silent grotto resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“whalebone reverie,” “shingled hush”—and stays anchored in the weaver’s perceptual bias. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences in reverie, clipped fragments during calcification. No head-hopping; POV remains steady and modest.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers image and action. Occasional stacked metaphors (“mandelbrot mirage,” “whalebone echo”) risk overwriting yet serve the fractal motif. No loops or filler; rhythm breathes with ritual pacing. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fractal recursion as literal prison, burdens calcified into stones, and the kerosene lamp as orienting tool form a fresh synthesis. Familiar motifs—mystical weaver, starlit grotto—are transformed through precise mechanics and embodied cost. The escape feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
