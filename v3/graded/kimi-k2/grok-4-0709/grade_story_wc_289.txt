<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority—"words he penned for others, secrets he guarded like fragile eggs"—is character-specific, and the micro-choice to use his own secret as bait for reconnection lands at the cost of exposure. Interior contradiction is shown when his self-protective secrecy collides with the public act of unveiling. However, his past with Mira is summarized rather than dramatized, muting some emotional specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The closure is cleanly staged: Mira recognizes the style, Elias hands her a scroll; this decisive act reweights their relationship and his covert labor into shared truth. Causality under an Accumulative lens is sustained—gathering anonymous whispers accumulates stakes until the spiral lantern event crystallizes them. The one slight softener is that the final beat is left hovering just before she reads; the cost is legible but not explicitly ratified on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lotus temple reflecting in the storm-lit pond is not mere backdrop; the shadow and shimmering surface physically host the installation and therefore the climax, constraining line of sight and foot traffic. The prismatic quiet—"rainbows fracturing in droplets"—threads through to the final image of refracted lantern-light, locking setting to theme. Detail is selective; weather aftermath is leveraged for immediate sensory grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Early signal of the dominant stake—“to find the thread that connects all things”—is made concrete by the threat of exposure inherent in publicizing private letters. Pressure accumulates as villagers add their own anonymous notes, narrowing Elias’s safe ambiguity to a single exposed scroll. The cost is felt when Mira confronts him, yet pressure could tighten further with sharper stakes laid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of shared versus solitary love is emergent in the anonymous lanterns coalescing into a collective mosaic; no direct thematic exposition intrudes. Final image—the spiral seeming to pulse as two people connect—recharges the motif without moralizing. Some earlier lyrical sentences flirt with abstraction (“invisible weave linking lover to beloved”), but they are balanced against embodied action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Voice owns perceptual signature—“keeper of secrets, a role that had chosen him”—and lyric control (“storm’s rage… cloud bursts”) without ornament overload. Diction is consonant with Elias’s romantic-observer lens. Compression and deliberate elision (“word spread through the village”) are legit for accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Information-dense lines—“floating lanterns on translucent paper”—carry triple duty: mood, setup of communal action, and foreshadowing of visibility stakes. No paraphrase loops appear; sentence rhythm modulates with breath between longer descriptive coils and the taut dialogue line “perhaps it’s time to share your own.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</question>
<comment>Fusion of ghostwriter-artist with avian spiral as “thread incarnate” is fresh enough to overcome the familiar “message-in-a-lantern” trope. Risk-taking resides in letting collective strangers author half the emotional payload rather than a dramatic duel, though the conceit edges close to sentimental installations already common in public-art discourse.</comment>
