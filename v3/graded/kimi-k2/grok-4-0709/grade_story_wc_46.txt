<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—yearning for stars yet renouncing fire—drives every micro-choice; the sea-glass pearl crystallizes her earned renunciation with visible cost. Embodied emotion (“her fingers coaxing”) and grounded micro-decisions anchor the arc. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Motivation intensifies cleanly to the final release.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each polishing pass layers density until the pearl’s glow reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—light shared without flame—felt cost in her earthbound stance. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks. One seamless scene, one transitionless arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Grotto’s serpentine walls and mist constrain movement and supply polishing sands; the sea-glass-turned-pearl charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Elara’s star-starved perception. Environment shapes tactics and outcome; no static backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—share light without fire—signaled early; pressure tightens as each polishing stroke renounces her old blaze. One meaningful deepening: the weighing beat forces a trade-off between cosmic guilt and humble atonement. Cost is visible in her grounded stance and released pearl.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: illumination without destruction. Subtext in the pearl’s “quiet void” reframes prior fiery failures. Final image scatters starlight without flame, offering non-literal resonance. No moralizing; complexity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled third-person limited; perceptual signature starves for sky yet savors earth’s textures. Syntax modulates with rhythmic polishing beats. No dialogue, so voice coherence judged on narrative texture alone—distinct and sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language serves pressure without clutter. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Rhythm breathes with the polishing cadence. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fallen star crafting a pearl of stillness feels fresh; trope of redemption through humble craft is transformed by cosmic scale and non-fire constraint. Specificity of grotto, sea glass, and mist anchors universals. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in closure.</comment>
