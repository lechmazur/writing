<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (synesthetic color blooms, “oscillating repose”), and her motive to “certify wonder” drives every strike. Yet the final choice is more ritual completion than active renunciation; the cost is atmospheric rather than personal, capping the arc just shy of Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each bell strike layers color and spirit-release until the cavern’s hush is re-sculpted. Closure is a Charged Poise—the spirits ascend, the hush is “enriched”—with the felt cost that Elara’s own moment of awe must fade back into silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ice cavern, prismatic bells, and fossilized mallet are rendered with sensory precision and directly constrain action: the cold dictates timing, the bells refract sound into color, the amber sheet guides the ritual. Final image of the cavern “pulsed with subtle energy” re-weights the setting itself as living witness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unfettering wonder—escalates via each bell strike’s intensifying aurora. One clear tightening: the cavern ice cracks under the final chord, signaling irreversible release. Cost is legible in the silence that must return, but pressure remains more textural than perilous.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through synesthetic ritual rather than statement: wonder is certified by the very act that exhausts its vessel. The ending’s “chisel that shaped existence” re-prices the sculptor metaphor, linking art, awe, and creation without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical, synesthetic diction (“emerald and violet hues, swirling like the aurora’s veils”) is consistent and character-bound. Rhythm modulates from hush to crescendo and back, mirroring Elara’s oscillating repose. No POV drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphors stay coherent within the aurora/bell/ice system. Occasional elevated phrasing (“oscillating repose”) risks register drift but remains anchored in Elara’s heightened perception. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic bell-ringing in an ice cavern is familiar territory, yet the fusion of sculptor-chisel timing with aurora-release gives it fresh specificity. The transformation of silence into sculpted hush feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
