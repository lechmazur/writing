<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifist scheming is embodied in micro-gestures and the silent choreography of the pin; Thorne’s cellular release is credible, but the shift from toxin to grace feels slightly compressed, muting the full cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Thorne’s stance visibly softens, the pin reappears in Elara’s hand—cost is felt in the vanishing of his resentment. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; one tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sanctuary’s flux is vivid and tactile—walls “shimmer and reform,” gravity tilts—yet the crystalline dome never constrains a choice; micro-setting (pin, palm, air-patterns) carries more weight than the macro dome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—release of resentment—tightens once via cellular memory; agency is Elara’s silent persuasion, cost is Thorne’s relinquished anger. Escalation is single, coherent, and sufficient for 600-word scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of shifting grace emerges through embodied action rather than statement; final image of pin reappearing reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Complexity lingers in the cost of forgetting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s sensorium; diction is lyrical yet disciplined, rhythm modulates with the sanctuary’s flux. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional elevated phrasing (“poisoning his every step”) edges toward purple but never stalls momentum. No loops or artifacts in closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Silent sanctuary + cellular memory + reappearing pin synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious fable. Risky conceit of wordless persuasion is fully committed and pays off.</comment>
