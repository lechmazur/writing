<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her feigned giggle, the spark from the eternal flame lighting her needle—but the contradiction between wisdom and disguise is asserted more than dramatized; no single beat forces her to pay a visible price for the mask, so the final renunciation feels slightly pre-paid rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the embroidered chart is hidden, the coup’s architects exposed, and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds—the candle’s pulse and stitched galaxies accumulate until the final silence reweights the stakes. One causal wobble: the vizier-poison tale arrives as pure exposition rather than dramatized memory, blurring the because/therefore chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory, eternal candle, and autumn chill are rendered with tactile specificity; the candle’s flame literally bridges timelines, constraining Elara’s method and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is tight—loom, viewport, crystal holder track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—foil the coup via unheard stories—is signaled early and tightens once when the high astronomer’s betrayal surfaces. Cost is conceptual (knowledge that cannot be spoken openly) rather than visceral, but still legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of silenced narratives versus official history emerges organically from the embroidery conceit; the final riddle-like concealment offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. No late thematic exposition intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature rooted in textile and starlight metaphors that never drift into purple. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short pulses during synchronization, longer breaths in reflection—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; the single risk—“gossiping comets”—lands as character voice rather than artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The embroidery-as-timeline-mapping device is a fresh synthesis of fantasy and spy-thriller tropes; the adjacent-possibility mechanic feels inevitable in hindsight and heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of star-silk and candle-flame bridges cosmic and intimate scales.</comment>
