<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s yearning for lost candor is tangible and individualized through sensory memory ("parched voids in her soul"); however, interiority flirts with diagnostic therapy-speak (“wilt of leaves, find the bloom of honesty”) that undercuts the embodied heat at climax. The end—where she emerges "renewed"—remains more assertion than earned cost traced through body or choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the final image rewrites the stakes so that unspoken words are not lost but archived and re-usable. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—each added leaf, map edge, and whisper orb thickens meaning until the cadence shift arrests momentum. Cost is visible in the tearful release of her own withheld confession.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Domed emerald enclosures, toxic haze, and dry hydro-tunnels remain tactile constraints—“humid alcove,” “condensation drips”—that guide navigation; the final vault of crystalline orbs literally charges the ending. World anchoring is immediate and bias-filtered through vermiculate vines and heat-warped floorboards rather than tourist lists.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Stakes—the survival of complete candor—escalate once: water, language, and intimacy evaporate in tandem until the map locks the only living path left. The tightening is single but sufficient under accumulative pressure, though the physical risks remain more atmospheric than embodied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of reclaiming micro-truths emerges through images (wilted leaf / restored orb) without didactic moral; final sentence leans an eyelash too close to summary “city might yet flourish,” costing half a point. Nonetheless, ambiguity lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question> <grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and plant-rich (“gilded-leaf calligrapher,” “molten gold onto resilient fronds”) with controlled sensory compression. No head-hopping, POV consistent, and every elevated phrase feels earned within the humid hothouse lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive: sentences advance plot or atmosphere without scaffolding. Occasional lush compound (“labyrinthine walkways, where vines twisted like veins”) edges ornamental but passes the ear without stall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Greenscape noir setting plus candric arboreal lie-detector leaves is fresh, and the postal-plate heirloom roots the idea in pre-drought nostalgia. Some tropes (dried oasis, sealed vault) skirt familiar, but synthesis feels specific, not checklist.</comment>
