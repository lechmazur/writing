<comment>Elara’s need to read scars is lucid, but her interior loops on closure-seeking vs wound-re-opening feel paraphrased rather than dramatised (“seeking closure often meant reliving the pain”). Tears alone do not fully embody the contradiction on the page; contradiction needs live micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tension thickens via layering of miracle, hourglass reversal, and vision cascade toward a Charged Poise where Elara embraces scars’ stories as the final reconfiguration. Closure cost is explicitly legible—“tears streamed down her face”—though miracle price remains diffuse, hence just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Mist-tower and dawn light anchor the scene vividly and economically; the hourglass etched with “frozen breath” recurs as a decision-shaping object in the payoff. One spatial anchor (“door” at end) needed earlier for full grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“read the stories in scars” narrows to embracing reopened pain for insight. Single meaningful turn at hourglass reversal deepens conflict; cost is felt emotionally. Escalation is sufficient for the length and the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from layered images of “meteor hush”, reversed sands, and reopened scars; there is no summarising sentence. Final embrace of unresolved stories lands with quiet, felt resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice carries consistent lyric compression; “meteor hush”, “displaced miracle”, and “frosted hourglass” return recharged. Paraphrase loops are minimal, rhythm varied, perceptual signature distinct under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose propels with dense, image-rich lines; small scaffold “she realised” once; no mixed metaphor. Peak moments crystallise rather than muddle. A single typo-scale glitch—fine for top tier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh fusion of botanic telepathy, scar necromancy, and reversed-miracle hourglass feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are recoded through intimate particulars, though “hourglass of memory” edge approaches a stock occult prop slightly.</comment>
