<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s idealism and dread are embodied in trembling hands and soaked floors; the copper nail as inherited curse/ key gives her a tactile micro-choice that forecloses safety. Interior contradiction—honor vs. station-endangering obsession—drives the final resolve. The ancestral weight is specific, not generic, and the cost (leaving the station into the storm) is legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: Elara steps into the mist clutching the decoded nail, the storm now both threat and witness. Causal chain—stanza → nail → coordinates → voyage—holds without gaps; the exile-reversal law is taught early. Cost is felt in the “spongey dread” that clings as she exits. One transition (archive to threshold) is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The weather station’s spongey corridors and salt-rot air constrain every move; humidity warps maps and psyche alike. The copper nail’s verdigris is rendered through tactile handling, not cataloguing. Micro-setting (warped archive table, catchment nets) shapes the discovery beat. Final image re-uses the storm as both barrier and summons, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reverse Harlan’s exile—tightens once the journals reveal the framing. One meaningful escalation: decoding proves the fleet’s lie, forcing Elara to abandon the station’s safety. Cost is the immediate physical danger of sailing into a jet-stream lull that can flip again. Agency is hers; coincidence only complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of inherited injustice and the possibility of redress emerges through the nail’s journey from curse to key. Subtext: archives and storms both preserve and distort history. Final image of Elara stepping into mist reframes dread as responsibility, not paralysis. No moralizing—ambiguity of success remains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is Elara’s: precise map-librarian diction laced with ancestral awe (“faded charts that whispered”). Rhythm tightens under pressure—long sentences for humid dread, fragments when decoding. No dialogue; internal monologue stays character-bound. Sensory filter is consistent—salt, rot, copper tang. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language (“spongey dread,” “humidity-warped maps”) serves atmosphere without clutter. Occasional stacked modifiers (“humidity-soaked corridors”) flirt with excess but never obscure causality. No loops or scaffold. Strong verbs (“squelching,” “unbinds”) propel momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Reversible exile as maritime law is fresh; coupling it to climate-collapse isolation feels inevitable. The copper nail’s dual role—seal and key—transforms a familiar relic into plot engine. Specificity of storm-archivist culture avoids generic dystopia. Risk: stepping into storm without guarantee of survival earns the lyric close.</comment>
