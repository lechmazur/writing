<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured through perception—murmuring fog, glass shard, scaffold wind—and consistently motivates micro-choices: kneel, lift, trace. Motivation “sculpt possibility from ashes” is legible but never dramatized as actual temptation to turn back, only reiterated as desire. Flawed past and cost are alluded to (“bridges burned”), not surfaced in immediate risk or mistake. Because the final stance still reads more hopeful than renunciatory, the closure cost floats beside rather than into the flesh.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Structure is accumulative/textural. Closure achieves Charged Poise: scaffold wraps + flake projection crystallize a route but withhold it from reader and Elias alike. Because-link chain holds: disappearance → flake → wind-mapping → dawn map. Cost is felt via the open dawn—not safety, only unknown—yet not dramatized as forfeiture, only potential. Orientation clear by 80 words; no drift.</question>

<comment>Selective, single-point details (mountain dusk, weathered bench, scaffold flutter) tether every beat. Environment never obstructs or supplies resource; still, the scaffold flutters literally become film projector, enabling closure map, so setting constrains outcome in micro-scale. Achieves “setting/tool charges final image” gate just barely. Spatial choreography clean; weather remains ornamental.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Single dominant stake: read the map hidden in ephemera to reach self-forgiveness bridge. Escalation comes through accumulating pattern (shimmer, flake, wrap projection), narrowing from mystery to route without outside relief. Physical/intangible stakes interweave: missing bridge between past and future. No reversal—deepening of possibility. Cost visible: impending dawn means Elias must leave safe perch, but not dramatized as irrevocable loss.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: digital ghosts & analogue redemption, forgiveness in fragments. No overt thesis; resonance carried finally by “bridge-song of redemption” note floating over mapped silence. Lacks a tangible aftershock—Elias’s guilt feels conceptually reweighted but emotionally low voltage.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Lyrical compression taught from first sentence onward: “road twisted like a forgotten melody.” Rhythm modulates with tension; short staccato sentences under wind-flutter beat. POV single-frame without leakage; imagery filters through Elias’s sensorium. No dialogue, so voice stays coherent.</question>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>High density, minimal loops. Metaphors precise, no mixed vehicles: “shadows projected onto the shard like a makeshift projector.” No filter-verb stacks. One minor repetition: “luminous disbelief” recurs twice—allowed as motif. Lines propel; rhythm mimics fiddle bowing strokes. No prose artifacts touch closure beat.</question>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Synthesizes digital-spirit folklore with wet-plate photography via scaffold wrap “projector”—non-obvious and grounded in actable scene. Fresh because the ghost is messenger, not threat. Slight risk is scaffold trick not fully seeded; nevertheless transformation holds. Overall specific, memorable.</question>
