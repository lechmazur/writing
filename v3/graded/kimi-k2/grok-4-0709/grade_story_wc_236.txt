<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elara’s grief and new vocation cohere throughout; her disclosure of losing her sense of smell changes Mira’s stance on inheritance. Interior contradiction surfaces in the tug between the wound that keeps her isolated and the urge to repair others—both visible on her steady-screw micro-choice. No relationship crucible is needed because only one character acts.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tightening occurs via the birthing-screw being seen, spoken of, and returned to its flowing purpose. Closure is Earned Stasis: Elara accepts her altered existence while the drip re-primes the future; cost appears in the precise sentence “a quiet tremor of peace.” Causality intact, orientation anchored by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Micro-setting—the brass bowls, the mist-laden reservoirs—guides their closeness and quiet. The midwife screw itself operates as setting-object, constraining choice in the final beat. Sensory selection favors tactile water and brass sheen over omniscient catalogue. Fog occlusion does service work to the “occluded view” method throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is emotional healing via tangible continuity; it tightens once when Mira’s fear is voiced then answered by Elara’s mirrored wound. Cost is not physical but felt limitation: the surrender to a life without scents yet rich in shared meaning. Pressure remains coherent without external antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Emergent theme: the humble artifact as vector for human persistence. It avoids overt moralism; instead, the water’s measured drops reweight “miracles in the ordinary.” Subtext lives in breaths, hesitant hands, mist-shrouded tears. Final line resonates without stating thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person-limited POV stays anchored to Elara’s sensory deprivation; syntax and imagery echo her tactile focus on flow and metal, never straying. No head-hopping, steady psychic distance. Voice texture—measured syntax with subtle lyrical lift—suits a shop steeped in clockwork hush.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes with water drips; no scaffold loops. “Whispered secrets,” “trembling calm” avoid purple overload because they serve the atmosphere of fog. Density high—“brass bowls, glass reservoirs”—each noun earns place; near-zero filler. Final sentence lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</question>
<comment>Familiar plot (heirloom repair) made fresh through lost-sense aromatherapist and obstetric screw merging midwifery and timekeeping. Transformation test passes: swap Elara’s wound or artifact and entire resonance collapses. No recognizable scene echoes; risk evident in sensory inversion.</comment>
