<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—nostalgia vs. release—is embodied in the seashell ritual; the micro-choice to place it by the spring crystallizes his arc. The “intimately aloof” trait constrains the moment: he speaks the vow alone, cost visible in tears. Flaw: the decades-old promise is asserted more than dramatized, muting motivational force.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the grotto vision reconfigures meaning, cost felt in the cracked-mirror echo and relinquished past. Causal chain—mirror crack → cave detour → seashell ritual—holds without gaps. Orientation is swift; transitions are clean. Minor slack: the wrong turn feels lightly motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The coastal cave’s quartz veins and bioluminescent algae constrain movement and supply the only light for the seashell’s projection; setting is not backdrop but catalyst. Sensory selection (cool air, distant roar) narrows under fatigue. Spatial choreography remains coherent through labyrinth turns.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—release the past or remain chained—tightens once in the grotto when the illusion’s fade forces the vow. Agency: Elias’s whispered renunciation narrows options; cost is the emotional tear-tide. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges: nostalgia as self-forged chain, freedom in embracing impermanence. Subtext lives in the shifting shell-painting and mirrored fracture; no moralizing. Final image of the “man whole” reframes earlier motifs without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, salt-stained, and consistent; perceptual signature favors color and light. Syntax modulates with pressure—long lyrical lines in the oasis, clipped phrases during disorientation. No head-hopping; distance stays intimate third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; figurative language serves atmosphere without clutter. Occasional poetic overlap (“temporary eternity” twice) is minor. Rhythm accelerates during wrong-turn panic, breathes in grotto. No scaffold or loops obstruct closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-and-catharsis arc is refreshed by the subterranean oasis and seashell ritual; the bioluminescent cave feels specific to Elias’s painter’s eye. Risk lies in the lyric compression rather than twist, executed cleanly.</comment>
