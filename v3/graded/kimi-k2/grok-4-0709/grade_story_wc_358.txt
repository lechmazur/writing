<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear-cut—she wants to cultivate foresight in action—but the narrative only asserts this trait at key junctures rather than manifesting it in contradictory felt choices. Interiority lacks intimate contradiction under hazard; “hazy precision” becomes a convenient tag rather than a lived stance. The patch discovery causes a minor tactical recalibration, but the emotional and moral cost of reframing the crash feels under-dramatized; the ending gestures at change without a moment of renunciation or irrevocable decision on screen.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The causality holds cleanly: winds → canyon → drone → catastrophe → patch → redefined investigation → blueprint for prevention. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis: Mara’s resolve crystallizes, the foresight task foreclosed with cost that the ghost-city silence makes legible. Lens is causal and consistent. One negligible moment of orientation lag—first mention of patch is late in timeline yet payoff is swift, so no sustained penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is tactile—fog clinging like a shroud, rusted hulls, improvised skyscraper containers—and directly shapes airflow data and tactics. Micro-setting success: respirator against chemical whiff, anemometer wedged in gaps, ash on hands during patch retrieval. The container corridors funnel wind and choice; final panorama of scarred horizon charges the foresight lesson. Near-gate but one minor over-painted description, “once-bustling docks, alive with the clamor of horns and shouts, now echoed only...” could tighten.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Dominant stake—understand why the city fell silent and prevent next occurrence—is foregrounded and steadily focused. Escalation stays coherent via wind-convergence data narrowing explanation. Yet pressure plateaus—no live countdown, no external force pushing her out of the zone; consequence feels cerebral rather than bodily or social cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Theme of forward-looking accountability emerges organically through wind-chart accumulation and patch recontextualization instead of explicit lecture. Subtext resonates in the silence itself, but the concept doesn’t fully deepen in final beat beyond restatement; still, the cautionary blueprint leaves credible tension in reader’s mind.</comment>

<comment>Consistent atmospheric diction—port jargon mixed with mythic tinge. Sensory selectivity feels professionally biased. Occasional grand phrase (“fog clung like a shroud” / “monolithic buildings in a derelict metropolis”) teeters to heightened register but stays within investigator’s contemplative mindset; no intrusive filter verbs.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lean and rhythmic with precise sensory anchors and high information density. Occasional abstract intensifier (“hazy precision,” “singular convergence incarnate”) skirts purple, but clarity survives. No paraphrase loops, clean grammar, prop tracking intact. One line of template cadence in wind-documentation list has minimal drag.</comment>

<comment>Accident-investigator procedural married to post-cataclysm port dystopia is fresh without gimmickry; patch twist feels inevitable once revealed. Fusion of wind-tunnel physics with personal memento reframes cliché detective clue. The silence-port-fog ensemble avoids derivative tropes; only slight familiarity in “plummeted into heart of the yard” keeps it from ceiling.</comment>
