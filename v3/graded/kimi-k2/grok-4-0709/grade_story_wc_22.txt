<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The coachman’s quiet ember of motive is embodied in every gesture—crushing pods, murmuring extinct tongues—yet interior contradiction is muted; no moment shows him doubting the cost of awakening the concord, so the arc feels more ritual than crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s first luminescent bloom reweights the battlefield’s death into life, and the cost—the irreversible scattering of the last pod—appears in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each fertilization beat thickens pattern until the cadence shift in the last paragraph crystallizes the new harmony.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The jetty’s “narrow vastness” is not backdrop but instrument: its planks creak under kneeling weight, its vines curl like living memory, and the eastern edge’s blood-soaked soil dictates the first pod’s placement. Environment constrains every tactical choice and charges the final underwater glow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim death with life—tightens through each pod’s release; the heron’s lament narrows options to the eastern edge, forcing a visible trade-off (last pod gone). Pressure escalates under Accumulative pattern rather than causal reversals, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of renewal from ruin emerges through the coachman’s ritual and the reef’s slow greening; no moral is stated, yet the final luminescent petals non-literally answer the question of whether broken pacts can be resealed. Subtext resides in bird-calls carrying extinct dialects—silence after the last pod signals completion without pronouncement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is a controlled lyric hush—syntax lengthens like twilight, diction favors archaic cadences (“Tenebris florere”) without slipping into pastiche. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: the coachman hears “fragments of lost songs” in gull cries, filtering every sense through his necrolinguist’s ear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and action (“particles danced on the wind, guided by his chanted words”). No loops or mixed metaphors mar the closure beat; the final line’s gentle sea-sigh is earned and exact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of necrolinguistics, spectral horticulture, and post-battle ecology feels inevitable yet wholly fresh; no trope is left untransformed. Risk in the quiet, ritualistic arc pays off when the underwater garden lights the dark without a single overt confrontation.</comment>
