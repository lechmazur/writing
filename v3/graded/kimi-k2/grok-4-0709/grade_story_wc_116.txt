<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The keeper’s motive—observe without judgment—is stated early and reiterated, but interiority stays abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene. His single micro-choice (unfolding the swan) is ritualized rather than pressured, so the cost feels ornamental. Still, the voice’s texture and embodied decay keep him distinct.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paragraph layers silence, decay, and folded paper until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—the keeper re-enters the library with “silence a bit deeper”—but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Library, refuge, and river are rendered with selective sensory strokes that mirror the keeper’s loosening grip on reality. The obsidian bench and swan function as micro-settings that constrain his stance. While vivid, none physically limit the final choice; thus capped below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintain detached witness—faces no escalating test beyond the generic passage of seasons. The “civilization folding swans” beat offers a micro-turn, but it arrives late and changes nothing on-page. Pressure plateaus rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of impartial observation emerges through pattern rather than statement, culminating in the resonant image of the keeper resealing the swan. The refusal to intervene is consistent, but the conceptual cost is muted. No moralizing intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic cadences that echo the library’s hush. Compression and elision are taught early (“Seasons drifted untold”) and paid off in the final return. No POV drift; diction stays within the keeper’s archaic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Occasional poetic abstractions (“reality bent to accommodate”) flirt with overwriting yet remain legible. No loops or scaffolds mar the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The folding-paper portal trope is refreshed by treating it as archival ritual rather than gadgetry. The keeper’s timeless vigil feels specific, though the premise edges close to archetype. A bolder risk—say, a moment of tempted intervention—would push it higher.</comment>
