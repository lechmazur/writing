<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “peripheral focus” is embodied in how he studies light and shadow—but the story leans on summary rather than scene for the decisive restoration beat, blunting the cost of his final choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the timer’s hum and the filled journal crystallize the harvest of wonder with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each reflection study layers density until the final image reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The marble cavern is not mere backdrop; its reflective geometry literally supplies the angles Elias needs to reverse-engineer the timer. The setting constrains every tactical move and charges the final image of stored echoes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder against future bleakness—tightens once: Elias’s daily return to the cavern deepens the pattern until the timer’s restoration forecloses the option of loss. Cost is visible in the frost-rimmed entrance and the spent weeks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the tension between rational cataloguing and raw awe is enacted, not stated. The final image of “preserved wonder” offers a non-literal answer—stored echoes as rational mysticism—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is textured and consistent: the locksmith’s perceptual signature—“peripheral focus,” “veins of white stone twisted like frozen rivers”—remains distinct. Compression and lyric patterning are taught early and paid off in the cadence of the closing sentence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is generally clean and propulsive, but occasional stacked metaphors (“symphonies that bounced eternally”) risk overwriting. No loops or scaffold, and rhythm modulates with the scene’s temperature.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of locksmith craft, echo-harvest, and wounded-season melancholy feels fresh; the premise is transformed through Elias’s specific tactile logic rather than generic magic. Risk is present but never gimmicky.</comment>
