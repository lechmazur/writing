<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied (“colors bled into sounds”), but the survivor’s choices remain largely observational; the final ascent to the red container is a micro-choice yet lacks a felt cost that alters the path. Motivation to “discover the texture of memories” is stated repeatedly but never tested by a decision that risks or forecloses anything. No second character on page, so relationship crucible not applicable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: fragments layer until the poison label re-weights the archive. Closure is a Charged Poise atop the red container—options reconfigured, cost felt in the talismanic clutch of the label. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. One transition (nightfall) is handled cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Port labyrinth is vivid, selective, and purposeful: rusted blue container, barnacled pilings, red container summit. Tide rhythm constrains movement and discovery; the poison label half-buried in mud becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rebuilding erased histories—signaled early. Pressure tightens through each fragment collected; the poison label’s discovery deepens the personal cost. No external antagonist; escalation is accretive, not causal reversal. One meaningful tightening: the label transforms archive from abstract to embodied loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges organically from overheard tales and the survivor’s archival labor. Final image—nameless yet textured existence—offers resonant, non-moralizing answer. Subtext in the dockworkers’ unawareness and the survivor’s silent appropriation is effective. No late thematic exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and perceptually specific (“shadows whispered secrets”). Patterned elision taught early (“filtered reality differently”) and paid off at closure. No dialogue on page; internal monologue avoids filter-verb clutter. Rhythm modulates with tidal cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective, not overwrought. Occasional poetic stacking (“rough like weathered rope… smooth yet brittle”) stays within taught pattern. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance story or atmosphere. Minor register drift in “conceptual repricing” phrase but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise—officially dead archivist of erased port histories—is fresh and grounded. Transformation of bureaucratic error into tactile survival myth feels inevitable. Risk in lyric-accumulative structure pays off; no derivative echoes. Specificity of poison label as personal relic anchors originality.</comment>
