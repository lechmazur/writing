<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Alex’s interiority is vivid—heartbeat counting as embodied mantra—but the arc from “officially dead” to “peace with resurrection” relies more on setting mood than on tense choices; the decision to defragment Elara is motivating yet feels externally prompted, blurring agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The causal spine—“death” → flight → Elara’s digital ghost → ink defrag → retrieved wisdom—holds cleanly; each beat reroutes tactics or knowledge. Closure lands in the quiet pause where wisdom itself is judged “enough,” rewiring prior material with felt cost: Alex’s slowed heartbeat.</comment>

<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The observatory’s opal light and snow weight form a micro-environment that literally reflects and refracts internal mood; however, the setting’s causal reach—how it shapes the defrag attempt—stops short of decisive constraint, functioning more as luminous stage than active force.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“fetch wisdom from Elara’s failure”—is signaled early and drives the ink ritual. Escalation is steady but slight; the tightening merely narrows hope rather than raising risk, keeping stakes safely contained in thematic rather than visceral territory.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>“Wisdom from failure” threads organically through Elara’s spectral words and Alex’s rebirth, culminating in the earned insight that survival is already lesson enough. Quiet, non-moralizing resonance underlines midnight solace without tidy export.</comment>

<comment>Voice is specific in its perceptual signature—the heartbeat anchoring every fraying thought—and the rhythmic compression accelerates under pressure. No head-hopping; POV autonomy remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and cadence-driven, with selective sensory detail; minimal scaffold, though occasional gentle poetic lifts (“crystalline dome”) don’t obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>“Digital ghost of a dead mentor retrievable via spilled-ink chaos” feels fresh within the confined space, though similar tech-spectre motifs exist, lowering absolute novelty.</comment>
