<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s haunted motivation is palpable, but interiority slips into abstract self-diagnosis (“understanding its price would be steep”) rather than embodied cost; the final renunciation is underwritten because we feel the drain yet not Elara’s visceral regret. </comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is sustained—each beat thickens the nightflowers, clipboard, spirits—culminating in an Earned Stasis CR where the celestial tableau and life-force siphoning reconfigures the stakes without overt reversal. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>“Weathered stone” and “veined marble” tether us in space, but some celestial flourishes (“languid waltz” of planets) verge on overwriting rather than constraining Elara’s moves; the clipboard and rune-carved terrace still govern the ritual choice at the end. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Elara’s bodily anchoring of the treaty—hovers vividly once introduced; pressure deepens with each spectral seal but remains textural, not causal, until the final siphoning tightens fate. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of flawed beauty accrues through cracked stone, dented ghosts, and Elara’s own dimming; it emerges without lecture yet risks a hint of cosmic sentimental glow in the “midsummer sky” framing. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Vocative lyricism, dense with scent and starlight, matches Elara’s gentle persuader persona; an occasional abstract cadence (“celestial bodies aligning…”) momentarily dilutes immediacy but remains on-brand for a ritual seer. </comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Sentences hum with sensory specificity (“incense that curled like the slow-twirling planets”) yet a near-paraphrase cluster around “price,” “cost,” “penalty” shows up within two short paragraphs; no fatal artifacts but the repetition dulls the final breath. </comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Blending diplomatic thriller with necromantic summit feels fresh; the ebony clipboard as binding relic roots the conceit in tactile specificity, avoiding stock fantasy without sliding into gimmick. </comment>
