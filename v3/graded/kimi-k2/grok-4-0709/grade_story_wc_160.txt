<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory miner/storyteller heritage is embodied in micro-choices—scraping adhesive, calibrating chain links—each action revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete (“his hands shaking”) and avoids label-speak. The final renunciation of force for “clever, compassionate engineering” is earned and carries visible cost in the trembling gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: discovery of chain → deciphering resin → integrating chain into floodgate calibration. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the gate’s tremble embodies the new, precarious balance. No orientation drift; anchors set by line 3. One clean transition from artifact to mechanism.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The amphitheater’s breathing stone and volcanic heat pulses constrain every move; the surveyor’s chain becomes micro-setting that calibrates the gate. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven (“warm air stirred the dust”). Final image reweights the space as both temple and mine, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harmonize reverence vs exploitation—is signaled early and tightened when Elias translates Mira’s plea into mechanism. One meaningful turn: chain shifts from relic to calibration tool, foreclosing pure extraction. Cost is legible in the gate’s tremble and Elias’s shaking hands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of encrypted compassion emerges organically from resin code to floodgate ethic; no moralizing. Final image of “resolved dualities” offers non-literal resonance. Subtext in Mira’s hidden plea and Elias’s tremble carries conceptual cost without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—machinist’s pragmatic curiosity filtered through volcanic metaphors (“dappled resolve,” “volcanic ash”). Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Voice stays consistent even under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>High information density; each sentence advances story or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are precise (“sunlight through volcanic ash”). Final line lands with cadence shift and image clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: volcanic amphitheater as negotiation table, antique chain as ethical calibrator. Risky compression of engineering and ritual succeeds. Specificity prevents trope drift; premise would collapse if relocated.</comment>
