<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“liquid silver of her visions,” “stabbed like hidden thunder”), and her micro-choice to trace the feather against the stone is character-specific. The buried-talent conflict is dramatized rather than summarized, and the final renunciation of nightly substitution carries visible cost. However, the childhood-village flashback is delivered in a single expository block rather than through present-tense beats, slightly blurring the causality of her pain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of nightly substitution → fraying substitutions → stone discovery → feather contact → rupture. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the mercury-glass orb cracks, foreclosing the nightly escape. Cost is legible on the last page. One minor causality wobble: the “old rite” appears only at the moment of need rather than being seeded earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is tactile and selective: “stone veins twisted into endless shelves,” “chamber carved from the mountain’s core.” The setting constrains choice—only within this labyrinth can the stone be found—and the orb’s shards become part of the final image. A touch more spatial anchoring in the alcove scene would have nudged it higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recover the shape of home via unburied talent—is signaled early and tightened when the stone’s glow forces Elara to trade painless illusion for raw memory. The feather contact is the single decisive escalation; cost is the shattering of her nightly coping mechanism. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is coherent and internal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: home as shared, living talent rather than place. The cracked orb reweights earlier motifs of substitution vs. truth without moralizing. Subtext is carried by gesture—the feather’s “soft yet edged” texture mirrors memory’s dual edge. Final image of “talents blooming like wildflowers after rain” offers resonant non-literal closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; mercury imagery and “hidden thunder” recur with shifting emotional charge. Syntax modulates with pressure—long winding sentences in calmer beats, clipped fragments at the climax. No POV leakage; perceptual signature is consistent. Occasional elevated diction (“entombing,” “labyrinthine”) fits the seer’s idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences often do two jobs (“Visions flooded her—not the false ones she crafted nightly”). Minor loop: “hidden thunder” appears three times in close succession, but the pattern is taught early and pays off. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph could lose one adjective without harm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—mountain bookstore as memory vault, mercury-glass as false memory, feather as tactile key—feels fresh yet inevitable. Talents entombed in stones reframes the fantasy trope through sensory specificity. Risk is moderate; no gimmicks, but the concept is distinctive enough to linger.</comment>
