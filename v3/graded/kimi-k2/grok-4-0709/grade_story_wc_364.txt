<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elar’s meek resolve is embodied in soft hammer-strikes and deliberate descent; the barter of silence for stone-strength shows contradictory impulses (fear vs resolve) and exacts a felt cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the “quietly determined” label is repeated rather than deepened under pressure. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Overall, a credible, character-driven endurance arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the azure guardians rise, orchards bloom, and Elar’s silence is the paid price. Causal lens holds—each hammer-tap therefore awakens stone via silk. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Minor drift: the ritual’s mechanics are half-glossed, but the final image reweights stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Floating arches and luminous fruit are vivid, selective, and tethered to Elar’s path; the mine shafts constrain movement and supply rubble for the ritual. Final azure pulse in orchards recharges the opening sky-image. Environment does not fully constrain tactics (shafts feel under-used), capping at 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—revive the planet—signaled early. Escalation is one deepening descent and ritual, narrowing to the single irrevocable trade of silence. Cost is felt (Elar’s “meek silence” bartered away), but the price is abstract; a more visceral loss would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of resilience-from-rubble emerges through action and image, not statement. Final azure bloom offers non-literal answer: broken things can rekindle if fed quiet sacrifice. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what the guardians will demand next. Slight over-reliance on “azure defiance” refrain keeps it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elar’s perceptions; diction (“luminous fruit trees,” “slain giant”) feels blacksmith-poetic without purple drift. Rhythm modulates with descent tension. No dialogue, so voice coherence judged on narration alone—clean, consistent, and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and sensory, with only one paraphrase loop (“azure defiance” repeated). Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles. One filter-verb cluster (“he began the ritual”) could be tighter. Otherwise high density, no scaffolding, and strong cadence control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Silk-bound stone guardians rising from orchard rubble feels fresh, synthesizing fantasy and ecological fable without cliché. The barter premise is specific to this world and character. Risky lyric compression succeeds; no derivative echoes. Could push higher with sharper cost.</comment>
