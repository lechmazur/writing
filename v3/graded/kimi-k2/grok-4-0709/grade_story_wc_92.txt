<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara manifests a single, clear stake—liberation through subtle sabotage—her vigilance and inventive tactics consistently impact beats; a second character only provides superficial verification, relationship depth isn’t attempted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal linkage parses cleanly: blackout creates opportunity, coded sundial drives allies to cradle, final twist of quill enacts closure; cost is legible in the furtive scratches guiding restored light.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The fort’s vanished luminescence is both metaphor and functional cloak; blackout manipulates sight lines to mask movement toward cradle; specific shadows cast by bronze anchor the climactic map.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—unseating the council via cradle—escalates with each blackout minute; Elara’s agency steers every forward beat, no coincidence resolves stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of power redistribution is dramatized through the literal redistribution of light; no stated moral, rançon-textual forcing the reader to re-weight secrecy vs liberation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Lyrical cadence and careful control; perceptual signature bends through blackout tones; concealment of quill during intrusion is a deft POV stunt. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose reads aloud cleanly, notable density in bronze-shadow mapping; no loops or therapy-speak; filter verbs sparse; final image crystallizes silently.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Synthesizes familiar spy-against-empire into crystalline techni-magical lockpicking fantasy; bronze quill as legacy tool and prison key feels inevitable, not bolted on.</comment>
