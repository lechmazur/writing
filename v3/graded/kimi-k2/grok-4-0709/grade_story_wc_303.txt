<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictions—scholar’s rigor against private yearning—live in embodied motion; every micro-choice in the greenhouse and at the violin re-weights destiny. Interiority stays concrete; no diagnostic filler. Renunciation of total escape is earned by causal triangulation of dream, empire, and plant-voice cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single causal arc: amulet decay → violin perforation → propagated destiny. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—her dream survives inside imperial cracks. No teleporting props; each beat narrows options under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Velvet, mulberry dusk, and ice-crystal luminescence are tightly filtered through Elara’s biased senses; the greenhouse micro-setting constrains her final propagation choice. Physical anchors stabilize throughout; no white-room drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—dream vs empire—tightens each turn; violin perforation and fern-propagation force decisive trade-offs. No coincidence rescue; every escalation traces to her agency under plant-voice pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of fate’s malleability arise from concrete particulars: the violin’s holes, the fern’s plea, the amulet’s wane. Final propagation offers a resonant, non-moral answer—garden within empire.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lush, mulberry-tinged prose modulates with emotional crests; no head-hopping. Internal monologue is honed, avoiding therapy-speak; syntax collapses appropriately under final choice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm remains controlled; imagistic density leans purple once or twice amid pressure but never clouds line-level clarity. No scaffold loops or redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Transparent violin as fate-warping ice, plant telepathy, and destiny perforation synthesize into an unfamiliar angle. Renunciation inside propagation feels inevitable, not gimmicky.</comment>
