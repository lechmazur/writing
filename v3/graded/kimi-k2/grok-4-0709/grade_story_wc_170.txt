<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the “borrowed heartbeat” is stated more than embodied. No contradictory impulses in-scene; choices feel pre-ordained. The final fade-into-mirage is poetic yet cost is only asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: mirrors bloom with possibilities while the painter dissolves, cost felt via “soon, he would return it.” Causal chain is thin—why this terrace, these mirrors?—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prism parapet, rain-slick stone, refracted spectra are vivid and purposeful; the surface literally becomes the canvas. Spatial anchors arrive early; weather and light actively shape the act of painting. Micro-setting (mirrors in walls) constrains the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—persuade mirrors to show possibilities—is clear. Pressure escalates texturally via refracted light and song, but no decisive tightening or trade-off occurs; escalation is atmospheric rather than option-narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of possibility versus fixed fate emerges through image and action rather than statement. Mirrors’ shift from “stark truth” to “boundless possibilities” reweights the premise. Final resonance is strong, though slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent; perceptual signature filters everything through refracted light and hush. No dialogue, so no register clash. Patterned diction (“coded lullabies,” “dusky harmony”) taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical; occasional stacked modifiers (“shimmering figures on the air itself”) risk overwriting but remain legible. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm modulates with scene needs; final bell toll lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Mirage-painter who sings reality into mirrors feels fresh; trope of illusionist is deepened by heartbeat debt and prism canvas. Specificity of post-rain optics grounds the fantastical. Slight risk of familiar “artist sacrifices self for art,” but execution is distinctive.</comment>
