<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s longing, contradictory impulses toward Marek vs. the call of the sea, and scrimshaw-propelled micro-choices are vivid and embodied. Final transformation lands with earned, visible cost when Marek is left on the dock clutching her story. Could tighten the merfolk legacy reflection to deepen stakes further.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a crisp, on-page Decisive Change: Elara chooses detachment and her body literally becomes “fluid and finned,” foreclosing return. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each appearance of the scrimshaw and whale-song increases density until the island crystallizes. Marek’s final image, holding the newly etched scrimshaw, is a resonant reconfiguration of loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sublittoral fringe is sensory and specific—waves lapping at ankles, emerald misted island—while scrimshaw works like portable micro-setting. Environment constrains choices: only scrimshaw-touched hearts can see the island, making the setting an active gatekeeper. One small note: island geography could be made more tactile when Elara steps onto it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom to embody true self—tightens each time the scrimshaw demands another heart-shattering moment. Cost is palpable: Marek’s tearful concession, Elara’s literal detachment from feet on dock to finned body leaving land behind. Combative-tenderness exchanges escalate stakes without redundancy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Emergent theme: enforced pacifism as subtle cage vs. wild liberty. Scrimshaw’s re-use turns theme: from locking people into feelings toward unlocking Elara’s own chains. Final image of island vanishing reconfigures the world-rule—freedom demands visible, irretrievable loss. Only minor deduction for one almost-label instance (“who I truly am”).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Lyrical, sea-logged diction (“current weaving through kelp”) aligns with POV. Repetition of “combative tenderness” risks drumbeat but remains motivated by its role recharging every duel with Marek. Scrimsahw “glowing faintly” avoids cliché through lived handling under moonlight. No head-hopping; Marek’s internal state stays inferred through external gesture only.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Prose carries rhythm like tides—short crests, drawn-out pulls. Strong verbs, no redundant loops; one near-loop (“waves lapping…waves”) but pattern serves theme. Information density is high, e.g., scrimshaw carving “scenes of tempests and hidden coves” in half-line. One minor metaphor clutter: “storm raging within her guarded heart” could be fresher.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Hackneyed merfolk ancestry given new charge here by integrating it with pacifist-world constraint and whale-trigger. Whispers of vanishing island feel fresher reweighted through scrimshaw key. Risk-taking—body-horizon transformation mid-stride rather than off-page—pays off. Deduct −0.2 for “whale song…sensed in bones” which treads familiar water; still earned in context.</comment>
