<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s solemnity and archival drive are clear, but interiority drifts into summary (“his heart ached”) rather than embodied contradiction. The retrocognitive embodiment is vivid yet the transition back to the zeppelin feels abrupt, lessening the felt cost of his vow. Micro-choices (arranging shells) show hierarchy of values, yet the final beat lacks a visible renunciation or new limitation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the diary’s truth is reweighted by Elias’s searing ordeal, cost visible in “gasped amid swaying bookshelves.” Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of debris-messages tightens stakes until the final image reframes the archive’s purpose. Orientation is secure by 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is selective and purposeful: zeppelin library’s sway anchors early, obsidian lagoon’s mirror recharges the final image. Sensory detail (salt, tear-gas wind) narrows under crisis. The lagoon constrains choice—only its debris can be used to parley—meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover buried betrayal—is signaled early and tightened through the debris dialogue; each message narrows options until the map is offered. Cost is felt in the “searing reverie” that scars Elias. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus solidarity emerges organically from the march’s sabotage and Elias’s archival vow. Final image of “history’s hidden fires” offers resonant, non-moralizing reweighting. No late thematic exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is textured, archivist-biased: “quiet gravity of history,” “glass black mirror.” Syntax modulates with stress—short clauses during visions, longer reflective cadences in library. No POV drift; diction stays within Elias’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“dunes rose like silent sentinels”) is purposeful. Minor scaffold—“searing reverie” repeated twice—dulls peak beat slightly. No mixed metaphors or clarity issues at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: civil-rights archive aboard a zeppelin, retrocognitive parley via beach-debris encryption. Tropes are transformed through tactile specificity; the lagoon’s obsidian mirror feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky structure holds.</comment>
