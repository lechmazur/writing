<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s face-blindness and artistic compulsion are embodied in tactile brushwork and fractal tracing; the interior contradiction—yearning for infinity while hitting human limits—drives every micro-choice. The final renunciation (accepting the portrait can only approximate the sky) lands with visible cost: trembling hands, sealed coin, imminent loss. No secondary character pressure, but single-POV interiority is rich and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the portrait becomes a portal, not a triumph, reweighting the premise that art can fully contain the infinite. Causal chain—coin → fractal method → limit revelation → acceptance—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One minor orientation lag: “condemned at dawn” could anchor earlier, but the final image crystallizes stakes with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The tree-trunk library is both coffin and crucible; its creaking bark, lantern-lit shelves, and drifting leaf constrain Elara’s movements and echo her fractal vision. Micro-setting (coin under lens, inner wall as canvas) functions as charged object-as-setting, directly shaping the final brushstroke. Sensory hierarchy is painterly: light, texture, scent of sap—never touristic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—craft a sky-portrait before demolition—tightens once when fractal recursion exposes her perceptual ceiling. Escalation is density-driven: each deeper groove narrows options until the only path is acceptance. Cost is legible: the portrait remains finite, the library will fall, coin is re-sealed. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and internal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the irreducible gap between human longing and cosmic scale. Subtext lives in the fractal’s endless retreat and the tremor of her hands. Final image reweights earlier motifs—sky, tree, coin—without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: the portrait’s shimmer suggests both triumph and defeat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is painterly, tactile, slightly synesthetic; perceptual signature filters every detail through an artist’s eye that cannot read faces yet reads light. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadences for wonder, clipped fragments at the limit revelation. No dialogue; internal monologue stays concrete, never diagnostic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers pigment, scent, or fractal echo without redundancy. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors. Minor filter-verb cluster (“she felt its weight”) but offset by immediate sensory follow-through. Final paragraph achieves Charged Poise through syntactic restraint.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: face-blind portraitist + fractal coin + dying tree-library yields a non-obvious meditation on finite art. Risky choice to make the climax a quiet conceptual repricing rather than last-minute rescue pays off. No close echoes; the conceit feels inevitable yet newly minted.</comment>
