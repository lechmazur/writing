<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena’s scientific remove is shown through concrete actions (kneeling, brushing dust), but her late softening is earned; the interior arc from detached observer to humbled caretaker is credible and embodied with minimal therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single continuous scene uses causal lens—flood damage → dust accumulation → gradual decay—tightening to a resonant reconfiguration: acceptance over restoration. Closure is clean, cost visible in etched leaves and rebuilt trellis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Storm-damaged greenhouse is vividly anchored in shards of glass, soggy orchids, and etched trellis; the micro-setting constrains choices and supplies the acid-etched patterns that transform the space, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is acceptance of gradual entropy; pressure escalates as decay redefines available actions. Each pruning or reinforcement is traded for visible bodily effort and emotional cost, narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—humility before unscripted change—emerges organically through events, charged reprise of neutron-star parallels, and a quiet ending that reweights pride into reverence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: scientific lexicon, sensory precision, controlled rhythmic shifts under stress. No head-hopping; POV interiority remains credible, idiom consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet readable; occasional stacked modifiers (“deflated sails,” “hazy veils”) skirt overwriting but serve tonal pressure. No scaffold loops or filter-verb clusters; momentum stays clipped.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Fresh angle transforms familiar ecological-restoration plot into meditative physics metaphor via butterfly dust; risk of lyric overwriting is kept in check, ending image memorable yet understated.</question>
