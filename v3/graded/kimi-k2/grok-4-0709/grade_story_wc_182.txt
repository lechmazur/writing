<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “carefully resourceful” trait is shown through micro-choices (cross-referencing diary, negotiating with guardian), but interiority remains abstract—no embodied emotion or visible flaw. Thorne’s desperation is declared rather than dramatized. Final renunciation of silence is earned yet cost feels intellectual, not visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the renegotiated vow permits revelation for rescue, a conceptual repricing with felt cost (eternal secrecy loosened). Causal chain holds—diary gap → leverage → access. Orientation is swift; only one transition. Minor lens drift toward allegory weakens causal pressure in mid-section.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mountain-bookstore is vividly textured (“shelves twisted like veins,” “crystal veins”), constrains movement, and supplies the diary as micro-setting. Spatial choreography is coherent; environment guides choices (guardian’s archway, illusory shelves). Final image of “music of possibilities” recharges setting as thematic echo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to Library of Unlearned Lessons—is signaled early and tightened by guardian’s vow. One meaningful turn: renegotiation trades silence for rescue. Cost is conceptual (loss of absolute secrecy) but not viscerally felt. Agency resides with Elara’s research, not Thorne’s urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge as living, audible growth emerges through floral scripts and unheard symphony. Subtext in diary’s “languages bloomed in petals” quietly reframes errors as organic. Final resonance avoids moralizing, yet allegorical overlay flirts with abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific (“melodies of meaning…between letters”). Free indirect style stays clean; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with tension—long cadences calm, clipped phrases under pressure. Dialogue sparse but functional; diction slightly elevated yet coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with strong verbs and selective detail. Occasional stacked metaphors (“symphony swelling…chords of curiosity”) risk overwriting but pattern is taught early. No loops or scaffold; grammar clean. Final image crystallizes without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes time-travel rescue, living library, and botanical linguistics into organic whole. Chronal lily loophole feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky allegorical tone is sustained without gimmickry. Specificity of floral scripts prevents generic fantasy drift.</comment>
