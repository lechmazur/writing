<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s desire to “learn the language of old buildings” is vivid and embodied; his weekly returns under doubt show escalating stakes. Mira functions as catalyst more than crucible—her choices remain opaque, muting relationship pressure. Interiority is specific, but the final epiphany leans summary rather than dramatized contradiction. Cost is felt yet diffuse, not pinned to a single renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rooftop seal-press reweights the premise—truth born of agreed lies. Causal chain (sugar → tea → lessons → interrogation → seal) holds; each beat advances knowledge. Meteor shower timing is coincidence that complicates, not resolves. One transition (stairs to roof) is clean; orientation anchored early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>City, apartment, study, rooftop garden—each space is filtered through Elias’s obsession, constraining movement and mood. The rooftop vines and meteor fire charge the final seal-press, making the building itself a speaking actor. Sensory selection narrows under pressure; weather and stone texture guide the climactic choice. No spatial drift; props tracked cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Elias trust the language he’s learning—tightens when he interrogates Mira under meteors. Agency drives the turn; coincidence (meteor shower) heightens atmosphere without solving the conflict. Cost is conceptual: the realization that belief, not grammar, is the true tongue. One clear escalation beat suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stories we agree to believe become the architecture of reality. Subtext lives in Mira’s evasions and the half-lit seal. Final image reframes prior “lies” as necessary scaffolding for truth. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s sensory filter; diction tilts lyrical yet precise (“vines clung…like possessive lovers”). No head-hopping; Mira’s interior remains opaque, as Elias perceives it. Rhythm modulates with tension—longer cadence in tea sessions, clipped ascent to roof. Dialogue sparse but subtext-laden.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive; occasional elevated phrasing (“celestial display”) edges purple but stays within POV. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or tension. Metaphors cohere; no mixed vehicles. Minor filter verbs appear early but vanish under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—learning to speak with buildings via extinct languages and consensual fictions—is fresh yet grounded. Tropes of mentor and magical object are transformed through specificity of dead dialects and rooftop ritual. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric compression pays off without clarity loss.</comment>
