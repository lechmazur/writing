<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s “gently meticulous” trait is embodied in every micro-choice—aligning lenses, sealing vials—so the trait is not just labeled but lived. Interiority is consistent and particular, though the absence of a second character limits relational crucible. The final act of sealing the vials carries visible cost (trembling hands), earning the closure under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the last illusion dissolves, Elara seals the vials, and the library’s future is reweighted. Causality is accumulative—each sampled vow tightens the emotional cost until the final sealing feels inevitable. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frozen library is not backdrop; its quartz hush and starlit spires constrain every motion and amplify the ticking fade. The lantern projector, a micro-setting object, literally shapes tactics. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful, charging the final image of sealed crystal vials glowing against endless ice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvage vows before oblivion—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens with each sampled frequency. Escalation is accretive: every sampled vow dims further, raising the cost of delay. The final sealing forecloses the option to save more, with trembling hands as felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance versus entropy emerges organically from the act of measuring and preserving light. No explicit moralizing; the sealed vials’ glow against the fade is the non-literal answer. Subtext lives in the tension between meticulous care and inevitable loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Voice is crystalline, hushed, rhythmically controlled—long sentences mimic frozen stillness, then compress under urgency. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices frost fractals, spectral hues, the pitch of light. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; each sentence layers image and motion. Occasional ornate phrasing (“luminous covenant of eternal guardianship”) flirts with purple but stays within the elevated register already established. No loops, no filter-verb stacks, no clarity loss at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sky-bound frozen library, light-thread archives, and spectral vows synthesize familiar fantasy tropes into a singular atmospheric stance. The magic lantern slide reappears with reweighted meaning, not gimmickry. Risk lies in the lyric stillness; it pays off in the charged final image.</comment>
