<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “methodically playful” trait is embodied in tactile micro-choices (tracing the nickel, tapping blossoms) and drives her escalating experiments; the final renunciation of certainty carries visible cost in the loss of her restorer’s sure footing. Interiority stays vivid and specific, though the visitor remains a cipher and thus relationship pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the single pause crystallizes into layered awakenings that reconfigure Elara’s stance toward knowledge. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each reflected sound thickens pattern and stakes until the final echo reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden is no backdrop; its refracted melodies and echo-leaves actively constrain tactics (paths shift with each sonic bounce) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Elara’s restorer eye, and the nickel functions as micro-setting that alters choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“exchange certainty for curiosity”—is signaled early and tightened through each nested awakening; every reflection forecloses the previous layer’s surety. Cost is felt in the vertigo of endless inquiry, though the visitor’s off-stage pressure keeps escalation slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the magic resides not in answers but in the generative power of questions. The final line offers a non-literal, resonant reweighting without moralizing, and the hobo nickel’s charged return embodies the conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that accelerates under each sonic reflection. Perceptual signature is distinct—Elara notices color as sound, decay as melody—and the lyric elision is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language clusters in taught patterns that mirror the garden’s sonic layering. No loops or scaffold, and the final cadence shift lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The nested-awakening frame feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming a familiar quest-for-wonder trope into a sonic palimpsest. Risky compression succeeds without clarity loss, and the hobo nickel’s reprise is a fresh inflection that heightens stakes.</comment>
