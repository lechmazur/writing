<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to safeguard creative spaces is told-and-repeated rather than dramatized; his choices at the brook are reflective, not decisive. Relationship pressure (rival copy-cats) remains off-stage, so character change feels asserted. Interiority uses stock phrases ("storm-born silence") without body. Self is present but not pressed hard enough for a strong arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mystery seed acts as inciting incident and idea generator, yet causality wobbles: the magical correspondence is half-sketched, the botanist visit deferred off-page. Closure idea is earned but relayed in summary. Orientation stays clear within single scene; lens skews accumulative until final lyrical reprise. Smallest closure unit exists but weak cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.7</grade>
<comment>Quiet brook and post-storm air are evocative but function as mood wallpaper; water murmurs never block or enable tactics. Setting fragment is localized and lovely yet mechanically generic rather than choice-constraining. Absent any prop or terrain detail that reshapes behavior, specificity stays decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>Competitive plagiarism is named as stakes but never faced in scene; seed's promise of innovation becomes abstract lifeline. No visible trade-off enacted. Conflict plateaus after incitement; single orthogonal leap is reported, not dramatized under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of nurturing creativity versus copying emerges through discreet image—slow bloom mirroring slow business—in a quiet CR closure. Final image (simulated corpse flower bloom) demonstrably reweights premise and offers non-literal answer about counterfeit vs original without moral statement.</comment>

<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Consistent intimate third, tactile prose laced with lyric rhythm ("pulsing with unspoken potential"). Filter-verb stack in reflective paragraphs dulls propulsion slightly. Dialogue minimal but where present, diction matches Elias's introspective tone. Voice crystallizes at close: charged poise on the bench under stars.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Readable, atmospheric, with supple sentence music, yet stock imagery ("tempest," "indelible mark") and paraphrase loops creep in under pressure. Few lines carry dual function; exposition summarizes rather than embeds action. Clarity maintained but information density capped.</comment>

<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The orthogonal puzzle-solution synthesis feels fresh and deeply tied to premise, but the seed-to-corpse-flower leap leverages prior novelty more than inventing it. Risk distinction shows in ROOM-PLANT coupling, though thematic turns remain gentle.</comment>
