<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s guarded mistrust and quiet yearning for transparency are embodied in trembling fingers and the deliberate projection of his own doodle; the final shared gaze crystallizes a credible thaw with visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, avoiding label-speak. The only minor slip is a brief “felt a pang” that edges toward summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s act of mutual exposure reweights his role from silent registrar to co-participant, with the felt cost of relinquishing lifelong mistrust. Causal linkage holds—each lens use tightens toward the final transparency—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift and spatial anchors remain stable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt’s rain-sheen and refracted light constrain every move: droplets guide Elias’s attention, the central crystal supplies the light for projection, and the hush modulates with emotional pressure. Micro-setting (lens, tickets) doubles as setting-tool hybrids. One minor spatial drift: “lingering shadow” could be sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thawing mistrust—tightens through each ticket decoded; the final projection forces a trade-off between isolation and exposure. Pressure escalates via density of revealed secrets rather than external reversals. Cost is legible in Elias’s tremor and the relinquished lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of honesty as liberation emerges through concrete acts: projecting private shame, witnessing another’s, and accepting mutual fragility. No moralizing; the final image of glistening crystals reweights the premise wordlessly. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is hushed, crystalline, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elias’s wary precision. Syntax modulates with tension—long breaths in description, clipped fragments at the reveal. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; each sentence layers image and emotion without redundancy. Metaphors (rain-soaked leaves, unspoken regrets) are selective and purposeful. One minor loop—“whispered…whispers…whispering”—is forgiven for pattern reinforcement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The wordless confession via doodled tickets feels fresh, transforming a mundane object into soul-eavesdropping tech. The premise commits fully; no retreat into exposition. Risky lyric compression pays off in the resonant final image.</comment>
