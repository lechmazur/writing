<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s grief is embodied in the detached shadow and the lantern craft; his micro-choice to polish the gem with dream-essence is specific and costly. Interiority stays concrete (“tears streamed… glowing faintly”) and the final release of cranes earns a fragile peace. The flaw—clinging to luminous memory—drives the ritual and its price. No second on-page character, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cranes ascend/descend, visibly carrying grief away while the shadow remains below. Causal chain—lantern → gem → cranes—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat layers density until the final image reweights the stake. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Cost is legible in the glowing tears and the lingering shadow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Floating tea garden, glass basilica, and vine-woven skiff are rendered with selective sensory detail that guides choice (storm-wrecked shards for the lantern, crystalline docks for ritual). The basilica’s refracted starlight charges the final release. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; no white-room gaps. Environment constrains the ritual space and mirrors internal ascent/descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmute grief into cranes—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: polishing the gem forces Elias to relive Mira’s dreams, narrowing options to release or drown in memory. Cost is felt in the “luminous torment” and the shadow left behind. Escalation is single but sufficient for 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of grief’s transformation emerges through the cranes’ paradoxical flight; no explicit moralizing. The detached shadow and glowing tears create subtextual resonance. Final image reweights the premise: pain can be folded but never erased. Complexity preserved—peace is fragile, shadow lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with controlled rhythm under pressure (“descending while ascending”). Perceptual signature filters every detail through Elias’s grief-biased lens. No dialogue; internal monologue stays character-specific. No POV drift or register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language serves atmosphere without clutter. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or action. Rhythm modulates with emotional peaks. Occasional elevated diction fits the mythic register and remains consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes dream-recording lanterns, detachable shadows, and origami grief-cranes into an organic whole. The paradoxical isle and luminous torment feel fresh yet inevitable. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image. No derivative echoes.</comment>
