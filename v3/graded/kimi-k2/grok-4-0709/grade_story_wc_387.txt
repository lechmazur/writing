<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured—his tactile attention to nets, moon paths, and tea foam shows embodied contradiction between quiet rebellion and village pragmatism. The final vow to teach villagers carries felt cost (foreclosing his solitary stance), earned by the prior ritual of whisking and whistling. Minor drift: “philosopher” remains more label than demonstrated worldview.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pattern density (nets, moon paths, fireflies) tightens toward Charged Poise at the whistle. Closure lands on-page: Elias’s vow reconfigures his future with visible social cost. Orientation clear by 80 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Coastal parapet, wet stone, and fireflies are selective and purposeful; moonlit grooves on stone constrain Elias’s path and later echo in the whisk’s patterns. Sensory hierarchy matches his net-mender’s bias toward texture and light. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seeing hidden effort—escalates via accumulating sensory patterns until the whistle crystallizes the insight with social cost. One meaningful tightening: from private ritual to public commitment. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of invisible labor emerges organically through net repairs, tea foam, and fishermen’s storms; final whistle reweights these particulars into a non-moralizing call to shared attention. Avoids overt thesis; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyric cadence and perceptual signature—tactile precision, hushed diction, controlled repetition—sustain POV. No head-hopping; free indirect style remains coherent. Minor elevated phrasing (“scintillatingly somber”) fits the reflective frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet textured; sentences advance image or insight without loop. Figurative language disciplined—moon paths, foam whorls, firefly constellations serve pattern motif. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar coastal philosopher trope refreshed through net-mender’s craft and tea ritual; synthesis feels inevitable. Risk: quiet lyric mode could verge on cliché, but specificity of parapet grooves and whisk-worn tines rescues it.</comment>
