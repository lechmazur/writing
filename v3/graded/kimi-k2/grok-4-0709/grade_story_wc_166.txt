<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—fleeing memory yet inscribing it—play out in the ritual. The final fusion with the garden is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Minor slip: “cosmic verse” is slightly abstract, not fully embodied until the blood-ink moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers density until the final Charged Poise reweights exile from escape to canvas. Closure lands on-page—“her skin a testament”—with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Garden, moonstone, and Elara’s body function as micro-settings that constrain choice: soil anchors her, dust becomes ink. Sensory detail is selective—starlight, moss, thorn—filtered through dancer’s perception. Final image of rooted-yet-transcendent body charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transcendence versus enforced forgetting—tightens when the gaps widen and claim her. One decisive intensification: spontaneous anchoring forecloses physical flight while enabling spiritual fledge. Cost is legible in blood and rooted flesh.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-resistance emerges organically from ritual and exile; no explicit moralizing. Final image reweights nostalgia ban as porous—“one graceful shadow at a time”—without stating thesis. Subtext in the silence between stars and gaps.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with dancer’s kinetic syntax—“feet gliding over moss in patterns that mimicked tidal pulls.” Compression and elision taught early; closure remains legible. No POV leakage; perceptual signature consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language clusters in ritual beats where pattern is taught. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“obsidian grace”) fits ceremonial register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tide-dancer exile, nostalgia ban, and cosmic tattooing merge into singular vision. Transformation test fails if names/places swapped—details are irreplaceable. Risk in lyric density pays off; closure remains legible.</comment>
