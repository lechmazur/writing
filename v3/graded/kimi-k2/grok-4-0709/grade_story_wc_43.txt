<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—rage at the smashed record vs. longing for forgiveness—embodies on-page tension. Elara’s kindness has teeth (hologram arranged) but feels lightly sketched; her drive doesn’t compound a flaw. The father-daughter payoff lands as credible emotional cost, earning Elias’s final peace.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The causal spine is intact: blood-work verdict → shard retrieval → hymning → hologram → goodbye. Closure is Earned Stasis: Elias releases his fragment, life “sealed in harmony.” Minor slack: the hologram call reads convenient rather than driven by an earlier constraint.</comment>

<comment>“Radiant haven above the clouds” and crystalline alloys provide luminous anchoring, but setting never physically constrains choice; it’s postcard ambience. Objects matter only as symbols—the vinyl shard glows, but no spatial or architectural detail forces a tactical shift.</comment>

<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (father-daughter reconciled before death) is signaled early and tightens once; hologram confrontation removes remaining option for further estrangement. The cost—death itself—pre-exists the narrative; the tightening is relational rather than corporeal.</comment>

<comment>Theme of music redeeming fractious lives emerges through concrete images (grooves, creaking swing, fireflies), not proclamation. Final image of the shard Elara pockets offers quiet resonance, but brief metacommentary on “hope’s scent” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice possesses lilting, lyrical rhythm that modulates under grief-pressure. Tight third-person on Elara maintains perceptual signature—cloud-filtered dawn, “subtle as jasmine.” Occasional overwrought phrases (“balm to those teetering on eternity”) mildly clog cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Sentence variety is deft, metaphors largely coherent. Two minor scaffold hiccups: “pulsed with a stillness that echoed faint heartbeats” and “quietly within her: to execute”—near-paraphrase. Otherwise propulsive diction with minimal filter-verb drag.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Combining hospice floating in sky with restorative music therapy feels fresh, avoiding typical gritty death-bed tropes. Shard-as-metaphor-for-healing risks familiarity, but execution keeps it particular to Elias’s biography. Slight generic glow around “eternal dawn” keeps score below 8.8 tier.</comment>
