<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s desire to preserve the dying’s final spark is enacted through tactile ritual and micro-choices; the internal contradiction—beautifying death while defying it—drives every beat and earns the final renunciation of her own spark.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>This is causal throughout: auroral hush to stillness→ emerald chip to closure; the before/after legible because thorne’s collected spark can’t exist without Elara’s precise infusion. Closure is present, costly, and crystallizes a new stasis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The auroras aren’t backdrop—their color literally pools in the gem, bolts the ritual, and re-frame the final sky-burial. Micro-setting (gem, body, aurora) narrows every tactic and images the afterimage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single stake: capture a last spark; pressure escalates exponentially as breaths thin; each sigil tightens options until the gem lights and forecloses any second chance. Only mid-sentence ellipsis in peak beats prevents full 9.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Themes of art against oblivion arise solely from Elara’s staged death ritual; final image of sky-released Thorne with chip silently rebukes void, a resonant CR that re-weights beauty versus extinction without moralizing. Perfect ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Auroral-purple diction is controlled yet singular; POV refracts all senses through Elara’s obsessive lens. Rhythm accelerates at each static flare; no filter verbs infect the peak beat. One of the strongest sonic control pieces under short-word load.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Read-aloud flow sustains hush-to-crescendo; no loops or paraphrase churn. Dense, purposeful metaphors—auroras “pooling like liquid hush”—serve scene, not ornament; purple phrases in climactic sigil tracing weigh lightly against their sonic necessity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Beauty-martician navigating death-stillness is a truly fresh synthesis; the emerald‐comet lens turns metaphysics into practical tool. Unobvious lyric structure closed by star-fern sky-casket—bold yet inevitable.</comment>
