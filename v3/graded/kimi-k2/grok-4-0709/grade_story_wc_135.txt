<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s reactive-vision trait is embodied in the brass-valve vision and her staggered revelations; the interior contradiction between archiving loss and forging future is dramatized through micro-choices (passing the valve, timing speeches). Cost is felt in her nightly solitary compiling. Minor slip: “reactively visionary” is label-adjacent once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each staggered interval layers density until the final image reweights exile’s void into communal chorus. Closure is a Charged Poise—the valve passed hand-to-hand crystallizes options with felt cost. Orientation anchored by 120 words. One causal leap: vision-to-speech transition elided but pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ivory spires, rain-puddles, and brass valve are selective, sensory, and bias-filtered. The valve as micro-setting constrains choice (passed among exiles, triggers visions). Spatial choreography clean; weather affects mood and footing. No object or environment constrains the final image as tightly as the valve itself, capping at 8.6.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—heal communal fracture via compiled memory—signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each staggered revelation tightens communal attention and narrows despair. Agency is Elara’s pacing of disclosures; cost is her solitary labor and the risk of overwhelm. No external antagonist; pressure remains coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of absence-made-meaning emerges through concrete acts (valve, staggered speeches) without moralizing. Final image of “compiled truths” reweights prior fragments into resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext in gesture—passing the valve—carries more than dialogue. One soft echo: “compile” used in closing line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture: “weathered bone rose like forgotten teeth,” “ocean-spray archivist.” Syntax modulates with emotional swell; short declaratives under pressure. POV stable; perceptual signature vivid. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal voice remains coherent. Compression taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language purposeful and patterned. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. Minor mixed metaphor “paths through fog revealing hidden shores” slightly dilutes clarity but does not touch closure. Rhythm breathes with scene needs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: post-exile archive-as-healing via staggered oral history. Brass valve as memory-trigger object feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off. No close echoes of famous scenes. Transformation test: story collapses without valve and staggered method.</comment>
