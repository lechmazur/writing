<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characters are sketched warmly but generically; the ghost’s altruism is asserted rather than embodied, and the family’s “reexamination” is reported, not dramatized through micro-choices. No interior contradiction or embodied emotion is shown; stakes pivot on group consensus rather than individual cost. Closure is communal, but the personal price feels diffuse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: the planet stabilizes and the family’s unity is cemented. Causal chain is present—chalk messages → bell → nebula—but the ghost’s agency is ex machina, softening the cost. Orientation is swift; transitions are smooth. One tightening beat suffices for length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Verdantia’s orchards, floating arches, and butterfly garden are vividly evoked and integrated into action; the bell’s nebula etchings constrain the final ritual. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful. Spatial choreography remains coherent across group movement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—planetary collapse—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the bell demands perfect harmony. Yet escalation is driven more by lore than by character trade-offs; the felt cost is collective, not personal. Agency is diffused among the group.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of unity-through-vulnerability emerges organically from the orchard metaphor and the bell’s harmonic requirement. Subtext is present but undercut by overt chalk aphorisms. Final image of butterflies in nebula light reweights hope without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is lyrical yet coherent; perceptual signature tilts toward wonder rather than individual interiority. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Diction is consistent, with gentle elevation suitable to fable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose flows with rhythmic variation and minimal scaffold. Occasional soft filler (“strangely trustworthy,” “brambled hope”) nudges cliché but does not stall momentum. No line-level artifacts in closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar space-fantasy tropes are refreshed by the orchard planet and butterfly bell; the ghost-guide device is conventional but executed with grace. Specificity of chalk messages and nebula patterns adds freshness. Risk is moderate; synthesis feels inevitable rather than surprising.</comment>
