<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the contradiction between enforced silence and inner tempest is dramatized through tactile micro-choices (handling the envelope, resetting the timer). Motivation—mapping scars to rarefy rage into poetry—drives every beat. The final sealing of the new envelope crystallizes an earned stance with visible cost: further exile. One hairline slip: “ghost in his own language” flirts with label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene structure holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: storm intensity and poetic refinement tighten in parallel until the final image reweights meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s poem sealed for covert transmission—whose cost (perpetual secrecy) is legible in the last two lines. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causality breaks. One minor redundancy: “storm-kissed wonder” appears twice without pattern payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The observatory’s glass walls, darkroom timer, and lightning-streaked sky constrain choices and echo interior states. Micro-setting (timer’s glow, envelope’s crisp edges) functions as charged objects that shape tactics. Weather is not mere backdrop; the storm’s roar times the rarefaction process. Slight over-reliance on visual lightning imagery keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turning censored rage into transmissible truth—tightens through escalating storm and poetic distillation. One meaningful deepening: the mentor’s scar-map forces Elias to trade raw anger for luminous precision. Cost is felt in the final envelope’s clandestine route. Agency remains causal under Accumulative lens; no off-stage resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of censorship’s wounds emerges from concrete acts: redacted poems, hidden timetable, rarefied verses. Subtext lives in gesture—slitting the envelope under lightning, sealing the new one at dawn. Final image reweights premise: truth survives only by becoming lighter, less dense, more covert. No moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is poet-cerebral yet storm-charged: syntax stretches and compresses like cloud fronts. Perceptual signature filters every detail through a censored poet’s lexicon (“forbidden verses,” “cartography of scars”). No head-hopping; interior texture coherent throughout. One near-tic: “storm-kissed wonder” repeated—pattern not taught—costs 0.1.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each line layers image and stakes. Metaphors (lightning-struck resilience) cohere without muddle. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short percussive clauses during timer beeps, longer breaths at dawn. Minor loop: “storm-kissed wonder” appears twice; otherwise zero scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar oppression-to-art arc is refreshed by the rarefaction metaphor and clandestine timetable mechanics. Specificity of scar-map as blueprint for poetry feels inevitable. Risk: lyric compression never obscures clarity. One derivative echo: “ghost in his own language” is near-platitude, but transformed by embodied context.</comment>
