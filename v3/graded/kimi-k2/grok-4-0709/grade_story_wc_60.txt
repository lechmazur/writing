<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s skepticism and “realistically imaginative” trait are embodied in her piezoelectric test and methodical unsealing, but interior contradiction is stated more than dramatized; the final renunciation of mysticism feels earned yet slightly tidy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly: the unsealing releases memories and revives fountains with visible cost—her glow dims as dawn rises. Causal chain (breadcrumbs → box → unstick) holds; lens is Causal. One transition (alleys → atrium) is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>City’s fountains and twilight are vivid, selective, and guide choice: mossy tiers and cracked basins constrain access to the box. Micro-setting (iridescent crumbs underfoot) constrains tactics and charges final image.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“liberate trapped memories”—tightens when each breadcrumb confirms the path; the unsealing forces a trade-off (glow spent, skepticism softened). Escalation is steady, not steep, but cost is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory vs. decay emerges through concrete objects (dry fountains, sealed box) rather than statement. Final image—fountains gurgling at dawn—reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is luminous yet precise, matching Elara’s skeptical scientist stance. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer reflective cadences collapse into crisp procedural steps during unsealing. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense; occasional lyrical layering (“sidereal patience”) is purposeful. One paraphrase loop (“defiant hush” repeated) is minor and does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Forgotten-fountain city and piezoelectric breadcrumb GPS feel fresh; skeptic-hero who debunks magic while performing wonder is a sharp inversion. Premise is specific enough to resist swap test.</comment>
