<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s mellow, adaptive artistry feels intimate and specific; each micro-choice—humming softer when Finn’s shoulders knot—shows embodied interiority. Daughter-loss keepsake never lapses into easy sentimentalism; instead, it enacts the character’s hierarchy of values (wonder > safety). Passive vulnerability is balanced by deliberate nudging, so renunciation is earned, not forced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal linkage holds: Finn’s unposture of joy → therapist’s invitation → eclipse stakes crystallize in a shared hush that narrows future options. Closure lands as an earned, quiet renunciation: Finn touches the curl, wonder restored at visible cost. Orientation is anchored early; minor amnesia around farm timeline kept brief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Sage ridge is kinaesthetically handled—roots form cradle, sage perfume prickles nostrils—providing tactile grounds for choice. Eclipse’s spatial choreography and sensory blackout constrain witness distance and timing. Setting never dwarfs characters but quietly escalates stakes by withholding daylight until shared breath equals wonder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—wonder vs. apathy—pressures both characters from the moment eclipse schedule locks. Eclipse’s totality forces mutual stance crystallization under coherent external pressure. No reversals beyond intended micro-shifts, yet totality trade-offs feel costly under situational lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Ordinary magic theme emerges via concrete beats: raindrop dance revisited at eclipse return to reweight the premise. Final image (sun’s resurrection while Finn holds curl) reframes wonder as a non-literal answer without sermonizing. Complexity remains intact; no tidy morality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited adheres cleanly; dawn-stage metaphor and dreaming-root diction stay within therapist’s lexicon. Rhythm fluctuates with wind-borne ellipsis and crescendo under eclipse, never head-hop. Dialogue sparse but carries subtext—Finn’s single “Feel it” cracks—earning gut-wrench resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Charged, selective imagery; no redundant set dressing. Only one loop—“roots dream”—pattern-taught and paid off in final hush. Synonym churn minimal; adjective use purposeful. Read-aloud rhythm swells during eclipse blackout,Compress-lifts like visible heartbeat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Solar-eclipse as ordinary-wonder frame feels inevitable and earned; precise, idiosyncratic details (sun gold on curl hair) refresh trope. Quiet reconfiguration within lyric line rather than gimmick satisfies under situational lens. Specific therapist–ridge dialect memo-maps authentic observation.</comment>
