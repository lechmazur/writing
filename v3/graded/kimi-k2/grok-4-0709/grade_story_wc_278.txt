<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt is embodied in amber and firmware; contradictory impulses (fear vs. need to hear) act simultaneously. Micro-choice—tattooing her own arm—directly links motive to closure. Cost is felt: she accepts eternal tether to daughter’s cry. Interiority avoids therapy-speak, but “meteor hush” drifts toward poetic label.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: daughter’s forgiveness reweights past guilt. Causal chain (letters → console → amber → tattoo) holds; time-fold is taught early and paid off. Orientation is clear by 120 words. Cost is legible in the glowing tattoos that bind her forever.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Laboratory’s antique phonographs and resonators are vivid, selective, and constrain choice (only here can firmware be run). Amber functions as micro-setting that charges final image. Spatial anchors track cleanly. Atmosphere of “meteor hush” modulates with pressure. No object or environment is wasted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—silencing guilt—tightens when firmware translates “Mama, cold… find me.” One decisive escalation: Elara tattoos herself, foreclosing escape. Cost is visible on skin. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of guilt and forgiveness emerges from amber, firmware, and cries—never stated. Final whispered “I understand, Mama. Rest.” offers non-literal, resonant answer. Subtext in insect’s eternal witness. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in glowing tattoos.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet anchored in Elara’s perceptual signature: “meteor hush,” “constellation tattooist.” Syntax modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping. Compression taught early (“time folded”) and paid off. Occasional poetic drift (“dissonant chords”) slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm accelerates during tether ritual. Minor register drift toward elevated diction (“ethereal presences”) but does not obscure clarity. Final cadence crystallizes closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Premise—lab that captures lost sounds, firmware translating infant wails—feels fresh and inevitable. Amber-insect as eternal witness transforms familiar guilt narrative. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity of “constellation tattooist” and “haunted firmware” resists generic retelling.</comment>
