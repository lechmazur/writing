<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elowen’s boredom-to-desperation arc is embodied in pacing, clutching the fragment, and the micro-choice to coax rather than force the mutiny; the final “changed—boredom tempered by knowledge” shows earned cost. Interiority is concrete (“threadbare tapestry,” “hushed thunder in her chest”) yet occasionally drifts into abstract summary (“millennia like echoes”). The curse’s hold and her desire for after-goodbye create clear contradictory impulses acted out in the storm scene. No secondary character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fragment shatters, pulling her back, leaving her “to ponder the hushed echoes”—a Charged Poise that reweights immortality’s cost. Causal lens holds: storm → mutiny → breach → fragment’s backlash. Orientation is anchored early (“prismatic escondite… deep within the Earth’s forgotten veins”). One minor causality wobble: the exact mechanism by which the fragment both enables and resists the breach could be crisper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The escondite’s refractive crystals and “mosaic of overlapping realities” are vivid, selective, and directly constrain her tactics—she kneels at their convergent altar to channel the storm. Sensory hierarchy skews visual; a touch more non-visual immediacy at peak tension would sharpen. Spatial choreography is coherent; distances and object states track. The setting’s prismatic shards charge the final image as they dim, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early and tightened when the breach offers a glimpse of “infinite possibilities” yet exacts the fragment’s shatter. Escalation is causal: each magnetic surge narrows her options until the final cost. Agency is clear: she initiates the mutiny, pays the price. One beat of external coincidence (storm timing) is allowed under lens rules.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of farewell-as-renewal emerges through the storm-breach image rather than statement. Subtext in the fragment’s dual role—key to escape and anchor to immortality—creates irony. Final image of “hushed echoes” invites reflection without moralizing. One near-theme-statement (“immortality had been her curse”) is brief and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“hushed thunder” motif modulates from external storm to internal pulse). POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hop. Diction stays within Elowen’s ancient, weary lexicon. Occasional elevated phrasing (“spatial mutiny erupted in controlled chaos”) fits the mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is patterned early and paid off. Minor loop: “hushed thunder” repeated four times—intentional motif, not artifact. One mixed metaphor (“spaces folding against their natural order”) slightly muddies physics. No scaffold or redundancy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of solar-storm physics with metaphysical farewell quest feels fresh; the “after-goodbye” angle reframes immortality trope. Specificity of the prismatic escondite and fragment’s curse prevents generic fantasy drift. Risk in lyric density pays off without obscuring causality. No close echoes detected.</comment>
