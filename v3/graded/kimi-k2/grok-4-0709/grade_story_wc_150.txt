<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—yearning for faith yet fearing the orchard’s snare—surface in tactile micro-choices (touching a root-wrapped ribcage, pausing at shifting shadows). The final Earned Stasis—her quietly restored faith amid bones—carries visible cost in the time and bodily effort of excavation. Interiority is specific, though a few stock phrases (“warmly curious spark”) dilute voice. No second character, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: each unearthed layer (sundial base, gnomon, scrolls) increases density and reweights the stake of lost faith. Closure—faith blooming like trees amid bones—is a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (three days of labor and doubt). Orientation is clear by 120 words. One minor ellipsis: how the gnomon traveled to the fungi patch is unexplained, but the pattern holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid, selective, and purposeful: roots cradle bones, bioluminescent fungi guide, and the sundial’s shadow anchors time. Environment constrains choice—roots block the coffin, fungi reveal the gnomon—charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s priorities: sweet rot and earthy decay under stress. Spatial choreography remains coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—restore lost faith—tightens as each artifact raises the cost of disbelief. Escalation is accumulative: sundial base → gnomon → scrolls, each reweighting options. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and internal. One visible price: three days’ exhaustion and the orchard’s perilous enchantment.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of interrupted journeys and cyclical rebirth emerges through concrete particulars (bones, roots, sundial) rather than statement. Final image of faith blooming amid bones offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture—Elara’s careful handling of bones enacts respect for the past. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about the orchard’s future claim.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent: “sweet rot of fallen fruit mingling with the earthy scent of decay.” Perceptual signature is selective and biased toward Elara’s cautious wonder. No dialogue; internal monologue is concrete and character-specific. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under stress, longer cadences in reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive. Occasional elevated diction (“cautious enchantment”) fits the lyrical mode. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. One mixed metaphor—“faith blooming like trees amid bones”—is earned by prior grounding. Final line crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: diaspora returnee excavates faith in a catacomb orchard where roots thread bones. Transformation test fails—this exact setting is irreplaceable. Risky choice to keep the supernatural orchard largely unexplained pays off via atmospheric specificity. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
