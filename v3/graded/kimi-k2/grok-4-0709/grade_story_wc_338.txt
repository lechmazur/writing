<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “shielded openness” and tactile empathy are embodied in micro-choices like pressing the torn map together. The contradiction between methodical curiosity and empathic vulnerability drives every beat. The final renunciation (mending silence, not excavating) is earned and carries felt cost. Minor slip: “interpreting silence with empathy” edges toward label-speak once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of silent footage → map → fresco builds density until the vault’s “exhale” reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise: the portal insight crystallizes with conceptual cost—no more digging, only seeing. Orientation is anchored by lantern glow and rain within 120 words. One causal micro-turn (indentations gone) tightens stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault and henge are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains action—damp air warps parchment, eroded stones shift light. The fresco’s scoured divide mirrors the map tear, charging the final image. Micro-setting (lantern, projector) functions as tool-as-setting. No orientation drift; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reopen forgotten empathies without violation—signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each silent frame peels away another layer of certainty. The rhythmic “breath” in the stones tightens the mystery once, narrowing options from excavation to reverent witness. Cost is conceptual but legible: Elias forecloses intrusive archaeology.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as living canvas emerges through concrete particulars—missing artifacts, shifting shadows—never stated. The final image (mended tear, vault exhales) offers a non-literal answer: empathy is reopened by restraint, not revelation. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers. Subtext in the silent footage is masterfully sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—measured, tactile, slightly archaic without pastiche. Perceptual signature filters every detail through Elias’s empathic lens (“ghostly whispers of color”). Syntax modulates with pressure: longer sentences for reflection, clipped fragments when the vibration is noticed. No POV leakage; silence itself becomes a character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence layers map, fresco, and footage into a single texture. Figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors. Rhythm breathes with scene needs. One minor loop: “whispered chapel” appears three times in close succession; still, clarity at closure is untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Few stories hinge on silent video comparison to reopen ancient empathy; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. The henge-as-breathing-organ is a fresh inflection grounded in sensory evidence. Risky choice to withhold all sound pays off by making silence a felt presence. No derivative echoes.</comment>
