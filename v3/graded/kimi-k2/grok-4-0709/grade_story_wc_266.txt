<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; the “leash of doubt” and “unused courage” are named rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses play out in real time; choices feel pre-ordained by theme. The guides serve as oracles, not crucibles, so relationship pressure is absent. Earned change is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the star-punched ticket crystallizes readiness, cost felt in the relinquished “faded fears.” Causality is lyric-accumulative; each detour is a textural intensification rather than a because/therefore turn. Orientation is clear by 120 words; lens holds. Minor slack: the ferry’s rules are taught late, softening constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The veiled ridgeway, shoreline lullaby, and driftwood ferry are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s awe. Fog and cliff paths physically constrain route choice, charging the final embarkation. Micro-setting (ticket punch, parchment scrap) doubles as setting-objects that alter tactics. No spatial drift; sensory hierarchy tightens under twilight urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“find unused courage”—is signaled early and tightened by each indirect detour that tests trust. Escalation is textural: density of mist, narrowing ledges, deepening hush. Cost is conceptual (facing self) rather than tangible; still legible. Agency rests in Elara’s choice to hand over the parchment, but external pressure remains gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of latent courage emerges through image and action, not statement. The shoreline lullaby and star stamp reweight each other at closure, offering quiet resonance. Subtext in the guides’ silence and Elara’s trembling hand carries more than dialogue. Avoids moralizing, though the final sentence edges toward overt synthesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with rhythmic cadence matching tidal motion. Perceptual signature favors sound and touch over sight, reflecting Elara’s attunement. No head-hopping; focalization stays anchored. Dialogue is sparse but natural when it appears; Mira’s shell-eyes and Thorne’s calm tone are distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; figurative language rarely loops. Occasional soft-focus phrases (“whispered secrets,” “forgotten melody”) flirt with cliché but are offset by tactile specificity. No scaffold or paraphrase loops. Final paragraph achieves crystalline closure without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Ferry guides at twilight on a veiled ridgeway is fresh enough, yet the archetype of mystical mentors and symbolic tickets is recognizable. Specificity of driftwood ferry and star punch elevates it. Emotional specificity in Elara’s tremor rescues the concept from abstraction. No bold structural risk, but transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
