<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s “confidently uncertain” stance is embodied in her micro-choices—tuning receivers, clutching the pen, broadcasting confessions—so motive stays legible under pressure. The interior contradiction (doubt + action) drives the climax, and the cost (crew gone, anomaly altered) is felt. Minor drift: the AI companion is introduced retroactively, blurring causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pen’s click and the anomaly’s stabilization reweight the past with conceptual cost. Causal lens holds—each beat is “because/therefore” linked to Elara’s signal exchange. The late insertion of the AI ally is the only causal seam showing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is not backdrop but active pressure: inverted raindrops, warped hull, probability ink. The meteorite pen doubles as micro-setting, constraining the final edit. Spatial choreography stays coherent despite disorientation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—undo the seed catastrophe—is signaled early and tightened through escalating signal intensity and the pen’s awakening. Agency drives escalation; the cost (permanent exile, altered cosmos) is visible. One meaningful turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of threshing meaning from error emerges organically from Elara’s edits and the anomaly’s feedback. No moralizing; the final peace carries conceptual cost. Subtext in the pen’s hum and the withered tendrils resonates without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“stars into elongated streaks,” “time like taffy”—anchored in Elara’s perceptual signature. No POV drift; compression and elision are pattern-taught early. Rhythm modulates with gravity’s inversions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One minor loop: “strange comfort” appears twice without new charge. Otherwise zero scaffold, high information density, clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The seed-mistake-as-gravity-warp and history-editing-via-meteorite-pen synthesize familiar tropes into a fresh, non-obvious whole. Risky structure pays off: the anomaly’s physics rewrite feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
