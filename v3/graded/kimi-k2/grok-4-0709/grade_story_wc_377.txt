<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied in her tactile tuning of bells, but interior contradiction is muted; the “color of wonder” stays abstract and never collides with a counter-desire on the page, so the final choice feels pre-ordained rather than wrested from genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the kinetic sculpture’s first performance reconfigures the bluff’s social reality and preserves wonder’s glow; cost is visible in Elara’s seasonal silence and the irreversible embedding of the fragment. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The whispering bluff, iceberg fragment, and kinetic sculpture form a single micro-setting that constrains every move; wind direction and refracted light literally dictate the sculpture’s cadence and the story’s climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve wonder—is signaled early and tightened when the fragment arrives; one decisive intensification occurs as the sculpture’s debut rekindles awe in ascending strangers, with Elara’s muteness as visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from Elara’s craft: wonder is not stated but enacted through prismatic light and harmonic resonance; the final image of strangers’ faces “alight with rediscovered awe” offers a non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to sound and light; patterned elision (“muted vigor,” “subdued fire”) is taught early and paid off in the silent climax. No head-hopping; POV remains anchored in Elara’s sensorium.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful, avoiding loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“crystalline shard veined with ancient blues”) fits the mythic register and never muddies causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of post-linguistic myth, kinetic sculpture, and synesthetic harmony feels fresh; the iceberg fragment’s impossible ascent and refractive role transform familiar eco-anxiety into a luminous, earned fable.</comment>
