<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; her contradictory impulses—flight vs. communion—surface in micro-choices (tracing the star, pausing the sweep). The final renunciation of pure hiding is earned by prior empathic tracing and carries visible cost in her tear-streaked stillness. Minor slip: “spiritually curious” is once label-speak before it is dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each star-tracing beat layers density until the final image reweights the premise—janitor becomes guardian. Closure is a Charged Poise: she stands lantern aloft, cost crystallized in the unspoken vow to keep falling. No causality breaks; orientation anchored by word 80.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Station, nebula hush, and lantern glass are filtered through Elara’s spiritual hunger; the glass constrains her final stance and recharges the stillness motif. Sensory hierarchy is tight—glow, hush, dust—without catalog excess. One micro-slippage: “ancient machinery” is generic until the later purr.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can vulnerability become strength?—tightens when the star’s fracture pattern mirrors her own. One decisive deepening: she chooses communion over obscurity, cost legible in the withheld sweep. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no false escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of strength-through-vulnerability emerges from star-paths and Elara’s embodied empathy, never asserted. Final image reweights the janitor role into guardian without moralizing. Subtext in the glass’s glow and the withheld broom is resonant and ambiguous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature is Elara’s spiritual synesthesia—light trails as stories, dust as balm. Rhythm modulates with pressure, no head-hop. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” diction in narration feels academic, but it is brief.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“flourishing stillness” returns charged). No loops or scaffold. Minor mixed metaphor—“machinery purring like a contented beast”—is the single artifact, not near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor + lantern glass + star-empathy is a fresh synthesis; the overlooked era frame feels inevitable, not gimmick. Risk in lyric stillness pays off in the final Charged Poise. No close echoes; transformation test passes.</comment>
