<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“water’s chill kissing her skin”), but the “wistfully pragmatic” trait is asserted more than dramatized; her final smile feels earned yet the cost is muted, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the harbor’s “subtle glimmers” reweight the premise with visible cost (her solitary labor). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, though causality between rose-petal and prism ritual is lightly sketched.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Harbor and moonlight are selective, tactile, and constrain choices (cold water, narrow inlets). The mirrored prisms act as micro-setting that charges the final image; only minor drift into postcard lyricism keeps it from 8.8.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—renewal of hidden life—tightens via each prism adjustment; agency is steady but escalation is gentle, not urgent. Cost is present (exposure, chill, time) yet not sharply foregrounded, capping the band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of guarded caretaking emerges organically through action and mirrored light; final image offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext of vulnerability versus exposure is coherent, though slightly diffuse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic oar-strokes echoing heartbeat. Perceptual signature is consistent; no POV drift. Occasional elevated diction (“ethereal glows”) is purposeful and taught early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off. One paraphrase loop (“rhythm of oars in water” twice within three lines) and a mild filter-verb cluster (“seemed alive”) nudge it down.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of locksmith precision with ecological caretaking; rose-petal/prism renewal motif feels inevitable. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric rather than bold structural gamble—so no bonus.</comment>
