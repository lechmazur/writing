<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to “preserve the sound of forgotten names” is clear and embodied in her micro-choice to risk the Heart of Names. The foxglove regret is palpable, yet the interior contradiction (duty vs. personal loss) is stated more than dramatized in scene, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the Heart ignites, names resound, but the cost—renewed awareness of inevitable extinction—lands in the final paragraph. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat layers density until the cadence shift in the atrium. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The opal library, glass orchids, and cracked bamboo tube are rendered with tactile specificity; the tube’s fissure literally constrains how the song must be played, charging the final image. Selective sensory detail (iridescent walls, silica petals) serves the tone without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Dominant stake—preventing final erasure of names—tightens once: the cracked tube forces a single, irreversible attempt to light the Heart. The price is the renewed sting of foxglove regret when Elara realizes some names remain unsavable. Agency is hers; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus inevitable loss emerges through concrete objects and actions rather than statement. The final illumination reweights earlier beauty as fleeting, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext in the scarred tube as “purpose rather than ruin” resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that mirrors Elara’s gentle systematic nature. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices through caretaker priorities (fragility, echoes). No POV leakage; purposeful compression (“foxglove regret”) teaches its pattern early and pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image or stakes. Occasional stacked modifiers (“poisonous beauty that laced her every action”) flirt with overwriting but serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; grammar clean, metaphors coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “museum of extinct feelings” premise is fresh, and the glass orchids, cracked chime, and song-lighting method feel inevitable in hindsight. Transformation test passes: swap any element and the emotional arc collapses. Risk in lyric world-building is rewarded by coherent closure.</comment>
