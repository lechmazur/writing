<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is lucid and consistent; the shift from indexer to guardian lands cleanly. Yet the cost of this identity reconfiguration is asserted more than embodied—no visceral forfeiture accompanies the discovery. The antique stamp functions as inherited talisman but never threatens or limits her; it is all affordance, no friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the blackout lifts and Elara’s stance crystallizes into custodianship. Causal linkage holds—each micro-choice (setting aside the failed indexer, kneeling to stamp the ledger) flows from the premise. Cost is present but soft: “secrets no longer sunken” is conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The sunken library is evoked with tactile economy—“bubble of preserved air,” “creak of the structure,” “cold floor.” Environment constrains action: darkness forces tactile search, tremor cracks the vault. The stamp and lantern serve as micro-settings that charge the final image when the ink blooms under flame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—uncover honest lineage—tightens once the blackout traps her. Agency is steady: hypothesis formed, vault breached, ledger stamped. Pressure deepens but never spikes; the seismic tremor complicates rather than endangers. Cost is intellectual redefinition, not tangible loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: histories are curated, not discovered, and the city’s myth is a deliberate palimpsest. Subtext whispers through the misindexed archives and the squid-ink stamp—tools of authorship masquerading as evidence. Final image reframes Aqualis as refuge, not triumph, without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is calm, precise, slightly oceanic—“dappled shadows that mirrored her resolve.” Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices patterns, weights silence, catalogs by touch. No dialogue to test distinction, yet interior diction remains her own. Compression and elision are purposeful and legible.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, information-dense. Occasional soft modifiers (“perpetual twilight,” “faint glow”) flirt with generality but never stall momentum. No loops or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph achieves quiet cadence that echoes opening stillness without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The premise—sunken city, blackout library, indexer as historian-detective—feels fresh yet inevitable. Refugees sinking a city to escape war reframes utopia as escape pod. Tropes (lost archive, ancestral seal) are grounded in sensory specificity. Risk is moderate; payoff is cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>
