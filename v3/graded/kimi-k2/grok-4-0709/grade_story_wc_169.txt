<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s lucid-watchfulness and logical-dreaming are dramatized through embodied choices (balloon launches, mandala edits) that escalate hope-altitude; the final renunciation of another timeline feels earned with visible conceptual cost. Interiority remains coherent and character-specific without therapy-speak. Micro-drift: some phrases drift toward abstract labels (“fractures in a world weary…”) rather than concrete stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: the mandala’s serene upheaval re-routes multiple timelines with a felt price—Elara’s personal time-stream remains fractured. Causal chain holds through “trial balloon → gauge reading → decorative recalibration.” Causal lens remains dominant to the end. Occasional summary compression (“revitalization rippling outward”) is brief and justified.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The grotto is more than postcard: its tide-polished resonance literally alters data readings and constrains how Elara arranges décor to bend reality. Micro-setting (seashells, kelp) is repeated instrumentally rather than ornamentally. One missed beat: driftwood has no prior cue, arriving late.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Stakes escalate via precise gauge readouts tightening Elara’s next move. The act-symbolic cost of sending the final balloon (personal data for one distant world) forecloses further expeditions, satisfying earned reversal. One off-page resolution (war-torn variant’s sudden bloom) skirts marginally close to coincidence rather than earned causality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through action: hope as quantifiable variable, equated to décor symmetry, ending in quiet upheaval without sermon. Final non-literal reweighting of mandala resonates without moral statement. Minor echo of “hope equations” phrasing, but justified as character jargon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual filter fused with logical precision (“charted reverie as equations”) stays fixed under duress. Rhythm propels via short imperative beats interspersed with lyrical, though meter occasionally flirts with template cadence (“With serene focus… she arranged them…”). No POV leaks or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>High information density; each sentence advances plot or atmosphere (“floating orb that floated toward the rift”). Sensory specificity sharp without over-saturation. Some lush figurative layering (“smoothed glassy curves into equations”) might trim one layer for tighter propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: mathematical hopeful AI equations as décor-mandala trial balloons feels non-obvious and inevitable by closure. Specific constraints—brass dial, tide resonance—are woven rather than bolted on. Risk (conceptual hope metering) pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
