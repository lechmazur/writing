<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied through her violin playing, but interiority leans toward lyrical summary rather than contradictory impulses in scene; the locust shell functions as a charged object but does not force a visible micro-choice that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s transformation is legible on the page with felt cost (statues topple, gears uprooted). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensification via music and rhythm—held without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective; the orchard’s mechanical vines and statues constrain choices by enforcing order. Final image of flowers glowing through torn metal recharges earlier motifs, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawakening beauty—tightens through intensifying musical pulses that disrupt the statues. One meaningful cadence shift occurs when roots tear free; cost is visible in crumbling guardians and Elara’s own fear shattering.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action: beauty vs. mechanical control. Final image of “tarnished wonder” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in the statues’ flickering eyes and the warming locust shell.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet consistent; perceptual signature filters mechanical world through musical metaphor. Rhythm modulates with pressure—soft velvet thunder swelling to symphony—without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful, though occasional stacked metaphors (“velvet thunder,” “seismic whispers”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwork orchard and musical insurgency; transformation trope is grounded in tactile detail. Risky lyric escalation pays off in the uprooting beat, making the ending feel inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
