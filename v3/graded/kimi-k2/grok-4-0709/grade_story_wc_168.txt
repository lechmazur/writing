<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eli’s contradictory impulses—protective duty vs. the need to confess—surface in the tactile handling of the box and the choice to stop and share it. Interiority is specific, embodied, and avoids therapy-speak. The final beat of “lighter now, its burden shared” earns a credible renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the porcelain box’s ashes are redistributed, the emotional weight reweighted. Causal linkage holds—Eli’s decision to open the box to Mia is motivated by earlier encounter and memory. Cost is legible in the phrase “lighter now, its burden shared.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge and whispering pines anchor space early; the porcelain box functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Eli’s fire-sharpened perception. The cracked pattern of the box mirrors starlight, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turning private pain into shared language—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Eli offers the box. One meaningful deepening occurs as Mia’s tears surface, forcing Eli to confront the cost of disclosure. Agency remains with Eli; coincidence (Mia’s appearance) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of “beauty in brokenness” emerges through the cracked box and scarred hands rather than statement. Subtext operates in the silent tears and the gesture of opening the box. Final image of the box returned “lighter” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and consistent: “gravel and warmth,” “granite wrapped in moss.” Perceptual signature is firefighter-specific—flames, ash, scars. No head-hopping; Mia’s interiority is implied through gesture and silence only.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is disciplined and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“celestial ballet”) is earned by lyrical mode and pattern-taught early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The firefighter-as-healer angle feels fresh, and the cracked porcelain box as reliquary of innocence is a specific, non-generic choice. Synthesis of trauma, vocation, and mentorship avoids template arcs. Risk in quiet lyric closure pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
