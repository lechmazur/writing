<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured through tactile perception and quiet resolve; his motivation to “decode chaos into a path” is embodied in every micro-choice. The final clasp with Mira crystallizes a relationship shift under pressure. Minor deduction for a touch of label-speak (“heartfelt artisan” used twice).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene arc holds: arrival → diagnosis → patch → flight. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Elias returns to his shop, path foreclosed yet charged with cost felt in Mira’s gratitude and the drone’s departure. Causal lens holds; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mist, fountains, and the caboose micro-setting constrain action and perception; the depot’s magnetic calm modulates with each beat. The fountain’s refracted light literally guides the repair, charging the final image. One spatial drift: “intertwined paths of land and sea” is metaphorically loose.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the drone before dawn—is signaled early and tightened by the audible anchor chain. Escalation is one meaningful deepening: the refractive test narrows options to a single solution. Cost is visible in Elias’s relinquishment of the drone and Mira’s departure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of mending as navigation emerges through embodied action rather than statement. Final image of the drone “cutting through the haze” offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing; slight deduction for “mending what was broken” echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s tactile POV; perceptual signature is consistent (“fingers that read the world like braille”). Rhythm modulates with scene pressure. No dialogue, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence advances image or action. One paraphrase loop (“magnetic calm” twice in close proximity) and one stock phrase (“moths to a flame”) keep it from 8.5. Otherwise clean, propulsive, and vivid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: blind artisan using water-refraction acoustics to repair a drone is specific and memorable. Transformation test passes—story collapses if Elias is sighted. Slight risk in lyric tone is earned and coherent.</comment>
