<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—“obituaries for the living”—is introduced early, but it stays abstract; no concrete micro-choice under pressure shows it altering tactics. Interiority is evocative (“mapping how wounds mended in distant lands”) yet remains expository rather than enacted on the page. The final choice to “explain” Mira’s absence is one beat of projected empathy, not an earned internal crisis. Consequently the character is atmospheric rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><closure unit>Charged Poise – crystallized stance with felt cost</closure unit><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the garden tableau intensifies in texture until the last imagistic cadence. Closure is the moment Elias recognizes absence-as-renewal—“redefine[d] options” reconfigured in the “final rose of autumn.” Cost is charged but only abstractly (“resilient against the coming frost”)—more poetic than visceral; hence it lands but not with knife-sharp price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Selective sensory layering—autumn leaves, damp earth scent, moss texture—grounds the single scene without over-cataloguing. Garden architecture (ancient cathedral ribs, crimson ivy) serves atmospheric counter-current to internal loneliness. No prop thread or body constraint visibly rewrites choice; it’s backdrop not pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Elias must “explain” Mira’s absence while acknowledging his own solitude. Rising pressure comes from intensifying sensory elegy, not a narrowing set of options. Tension grows texture-ally rather than causally, consistent with Accumulative lens. Closure does not trade off life-options; it crystallizes acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</comment><comment>Theme—absence as spatial healing—emerges through repeated motif of “geography of healing” and climaxes in the final image of renewal. No moral is stated; the autumn rose offers a charged non-literal answer. Subtext is present in the garden’s funeral-loneliness that doubles as rebirth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyrical with consistent distance. Voice is textured (“weft thread…like captured starlight”), though syntactic cadences verge on template. No head-hop; POV holds inside Elias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose balances dense lyricism and clarity; occasional overwriting peaks (“rain-slicked street echoes,” “majestic hush repeats”). Loops negligible. Minor register drift into poetic diction (“soulful geography”) fits lyric mode without clarity harm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Premise—living obituaries—as conceit is fresh but under-exploited; projection-by-thread leans more ritual description than transformative invention. Emotional specificity around Mira saves it from mere novelty.</comment>
