<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is vivid and embodied—prism in hand, breath steady, stance rooted—but her final epiphany for Marcus is asserted more than dramatized by prior choice; the cost lands emotionally yet feels narrated rather than earned in micro-decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Scene is single-location, causality-by-perception under Accumulative lens. Closure crystallizes as “faint warmth” and Marcus’s gasping contact yield conceptual cost; no causality break, earned image reweights premise. Orientation debt waived: haze disorientation is functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mist-quartz arbor and frost-etched glass are sensuously specific, anchoring spatial choreography; frost pattern itself constrains Elara’s tracing choices, and the final warmth felt through glass recasts the rusted car as final image—strong closure linkage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Dominant stake—“prove objects absorb emotions”—tightens when Elara’s lie refracts into Marcus’s visceral echo. Pressure grows via because/therefore under Accumulative lens from prism reveal to physical touch of pain, cost now embodied; one clear move suffices.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: object as silent witness to betrayals, “truthful lie” as bridge. No moralizing final paragraph; final warmth reweights “silent sponge” metaphor without thesis statement—earned through specific embodied pain.</question>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is coherent lyric third-person, perceptual signature tuned to crystal glints and frost geometry; “shifts hush” motif modulated without drift. Compression is taught early and paid off in last line’s sensory exhalation; no register leakage.</question>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Rhythm is deliberate and varied; sentences perform double duty: “glass prism splitting light into veins that highlighted a fractal resembling a fractured heart”—information dense. Mild risk of over-description (“forgotten secrets,” “open-air cathedral”) but no clutter in climax, clarity preserved.</question>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>Fresh angle: empathic materialism rendered through micro-optics of ice. Prism-as-emotional-lens and frost-as-memory-map are specific inventions; the familiar “haunted artifact” trope is reconfigured via optical science and deliberate deceit. Inevitable in hindsight.</question>
