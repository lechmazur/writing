<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied in copper-veined skin and the tactile vocabulary of bark/silk; the final endurance—emerging with veins thrumming—shows cost. Yet the shift from observer to actor is compressed; more contradiction mid-scene would lift it to 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo layer thickens until the diamond-bird synergy crystallizes the language into immortal chorus. Closure is a Charged Poise—the canyon will keep singing—cost legible in the thrumming veins.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bone towers and tunnel acoustics constrain tactics: only here can texture become sound. Micro-setting of the diamond’s refracted light and copper veins charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—death of language—tightens as elders fade; the final act forecloses the option of spoken preservation. Escalation is textural: each echo layer adds density until the chorus replaces the tongue. Cost is the storyteller’s own voice now expendable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the texture-to-sound transmutation without sermonizing. The canyon’s endless chorus reweights the premise: extinction becomes continuity, a Conceptual Repricing felt in the final “quietly articulate symphony.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, tactile, copper-lit; diction mirrors the language’s grain and silk. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent. Rhythm modulates with wind and echo, achieving quiet grandeur without purple drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Sentences are dense yet limpid; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each line advances texture or stakes. Final image—“the canyon would sing the textures forever”—lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistics, cursed geology, and avian choreography; nothing feels templated. The flawed diamond as linguistic capacitor is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk-taking in texture-to-sound transmutation pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
