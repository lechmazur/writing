<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interior contradiction—gentle radicalism vs. retrocognitive compulsion—shows in embodied beats (kneeling, tracing chips, pressing tessera) and motivates the renaming. The final smile registers cost: he remains trapped yet is no longer alone, a credible Earned Stasis. The retrocognitive flashes tilt toward summary rather than simultaneous contradiction, trimming the top band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the renamed Guardian hesitates, reconfiguring the plaza’s social order. Causal chain holds—lure → ritual → renaming → hesitation—under a Causal lens. The retrocognitive origin flash is the only beat that risks outline drift, but it pays off by charging the renaming with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shattered sky and frozen stones anchor place and mood; the tessera and mosaic stepping stone constrain the ritual mechanics. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful, but the plaza’s spatial choreography could be tighter—distance to the automaton is implied rather than tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awaken mercy in a machine—tightens once: renaming forecloses Elias’s anonymity and risks retaliation. The cost is felt in the Guardian’s hesitation and Elias’s unchanged retrocognitive curse. Pressure is coherent but single-turn; no secondary escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy emerges through action (renaming) and image (warm coldness), not statement. Final image of Guardian’s glowing eyes reweights the premise: compassion can root in steel. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the unchanged sky.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in Elias’s perceptual signature—“warm coldness,” “braille from the past.” Syntax modulates with retrocognitive intrusions. No dialogue, so voice cohesion rests on internal texture, which holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional stacked modifiers (“golden hues… icy bite”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with the ritual. One mixed metaphor—“arms of steel” next to “cradle empathy”—slightly blurs physical logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fusion of post-apocalyptic ruin, retrocognitive curse, and machine empathy feels fresh. Renaming as revolutionary act is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of the tessera code and chipped mosaic language resists generic templates.</comment>
