<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is textured—her fingers tracing the blank, the scent of ash—but the shift from passive grief to active carving is slightly under-motivated; the “harvest lessons” motive is stated rather than dramatized. The final smile feels earned yet light on visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shaving of wood layers density toward the Charged Poise of the half-formed lion watching her. Closure lands with conceptual cost—grief shaped, not solved—though the kettle’s whistle is a convenient rather than causal pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is vivid and filters every beat; the ash blank literally constrains her cuts, while steam and scent ground the micro-setting. Weather and tool interleave with action, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—containing impermanence through carving—tightens once: the first cut commits her to shaping loss. Pressure is coherent but singular; no second reversal or felt price beyond the quiet act itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of impermanence vs. crystallized time emerges organically from the blank’s transformation; the final image reframes earlier “here and gone” without sermon. Subtext in the lion’s watching eyes is potent, though the kettle’s symbolism edges toward overt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with sensory specificity and rhythmic control (“rust-hued peace,” “beads racing like thoughts”). Compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; only minor loops (“here and gone” refrain) and one mixed metaphor (“tears frozen in descent”) slightly dull the edge. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The circus-widow premise is familiar, but the carving-as-containment angle and the lion blank’s gaze give it fresh emotional torque. Specificity of scent, texture, and sound lifts it above trope.</comment>
