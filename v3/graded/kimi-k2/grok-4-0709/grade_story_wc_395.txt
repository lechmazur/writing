<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession with the 47s and lost crew is clear, but the interior complexity—how this drive collides with her loyalty to corporate secrecy—stays more asserted than enacted. Her decision to lie to the AI is consequential, yet it arrives near the close with little prior friction from contradictory self-interests.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure gives us a Conceptual Repricing: the “ghost” crew live, deleted data truly hides people, and Elara leaves with only a memory as cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality stretches—how the patch uploads itself to the archive is elided—but the deepening of absence charges the final moment effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Social Nexus vault of warped playlists and dead profiles is vivid; the patch’s metadata sears against the “sensed absence” with tactile loss. The archive itself doesn’t restrain any late choice, but the patch’s final reprise tightens its emotional grip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Core stake—vanished lives versus corporate erasure—is signaled early and tightened once: Elara’s lie risks her job and forces her download attempt. The cost (now she alone carries the truth) lands with felt, if modest, weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of digital afterlife and ghost data emerges organically; the closing sense that erased identities survive only as memories in living minds resonates without overt moralizing. A slightly tidy echo about “secrets preserved only in memory” dips toward editorial summation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured—“melancholic soundtrack of forgotten songs,” “petabytes of abandoned posts”—and maintains Elara’s data-miner perceptual slant throughout. Minor slips include a slightly corporate gloss in “corporate review” and “forbidden subroutine” that nudges away from her idiolect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Syntax pulses with purposeful lists and compressions—“echoes in the data like a breadcrumb trail”—and avoids loops. One near-redundant “archive/archive” could be excised without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The Elysium-ghosts-hide-inside-deleted-data conceit feels fresh, marrying a cold-case SF angle with the banal horror of social-media deletion. Specificity—“47 comments,” “4:47 AM metadata”—keeps it from abstract cleverness.</comment>
