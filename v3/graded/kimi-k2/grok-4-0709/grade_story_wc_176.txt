<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Elara's guilt-to-resolve arc shows embodied emotion and specific micro-choices (threading rope to card holes); the internal thaw feels earned, though "technically gentle" remains largely asserted through craft rather than enacted conflict on page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's re-woven rope releases ancestral voices and melts her residual shame into charged poise; causal chain holds even under accumulative lens, cost in the auroral flood of remembered names is explicit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Ice chamber reframes as acoustic vault; aurora's color shift serves both physical catalyst and psychic illumination, constraining final gesture; minor penalty for early cataloging of ice hues that risk postcard excess before action locks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Central stake (to resurrect vanished names) tightens once through rope re-patterning; no deeper escalation, but coherent pressure under accumulative lens where density of light/sound accumulation itself reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-preservation emerges from Elara’s artisanal choices; final tonal shift from guilt-cold to living-warmth reweights premise without moral statement; slight lift for unforced resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question>
<comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined; rhythm mirrors glacial slow-to-warm movement; minor drift into lyric generalities (“ceaseless dance of the aurora”) but consistent perceptual signature sustains.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Sentence music strong; occasional stacked modifiers (“hummed… faint crackle of ice shifting… ethereal glow”) hover near density cap but serve atmospheric compression; no clarity breaks, no loops in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</question>
<comment>Marries lost wax casting, carnival punch cards, and Inuit aurora ritual into fresh thematic synthesis; originality comes from material specificity rather than twist, avoiding trope fatigue.</comment>
