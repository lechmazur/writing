<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Elias is sharply drawn through embodied micro-reacts (thumb in dent, toe-scuff, adjust stance under magnetic pull) and contradictory impulses—vulnerability masked as precision, exile softened by curiosity—that culminate in an earned quiet renunciation, sealing his arc with felt cost on arrival at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Closure lands unmistakably: the charged act of pressing dented stone during the phase-shift radically narrows Elias’s future choices to a single stance (gentle return vs. vengeance), with causality upheld under inferential Accumulative/Textural lens—one deepening followed by a crystallized final image that carries visible conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The magnetic nexus is not scenery porn; its pull literally tugs at cloak buttons and reorganizes iron filings, squeezing Elias’s ‘stone-plus-body’ into tactile ground-state choices, culminating when the charged finale extracts polarity reversal as thematic cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>A single escalating gradient: the king’s reckless knight sacrifice, Elias’s exile silence, the nexus phase deadline—each compression raises the emotional price, forcing the quiet yet decisive move to press stone and seal return, not revenge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The “beauty in difficulty” refrain isn’t announced; it emerges when Elias observes flawed, dented imperfection←→masterful play, then enacts a non-literal answer in the final renunciation—a hopeful melancholy glow without moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Distinct perceptual signature: a chess tutor’s hyper-reliance on pattern-recognition rhythms fused with bodily precarity (thumb on stone, cloak tugged), no head-hopping, elided temporal gaps taught early by magnetic drifts, paying off in charged final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is supple and propulsive—short, percussive sentences during magnetic surges, elongated breaths for twilight; no loops except one near-synonym cluster (“magnetic pull…magnetic hum…magnetic nexus”) which reads intentional, so cap ‑0.2 only; final image stays crystalline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: magnetic chess equilibrium inverted, dented-flaw→resilience turned strategy, hopeful exile as quiet homecoming—risky yet inevitable in hindsight, textured by specificity and earned cost.</comment>
