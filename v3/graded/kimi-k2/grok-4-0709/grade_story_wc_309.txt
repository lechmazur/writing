<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elowen’s quiet longing is embodied in tactile cold and fumbling fingers; the final weeping lands as earned cost. Interior contradiction—yearning for wonder while fearing his own inadequacy—remains vivid. Micro-choice to unstrap the keystone crystallizes values under pressure. Flaw: “underachiever” is asserted more than dramatized until the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the keystone’s light reweights the premise, proving automation cannot replicate sacred simplicity. Causal chain—resolve → mist walk → unstrap → bloom—holds without gaps. Cost is visible in melted ice and Elowen’s tears. Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Icebound spire and frozen folly are rendered through selective sensory detail that constrains movement and shapes the final thaw. Micro-setting of the keystone itself functions as charged object. Occasional grandeur drifts toward postcard, but the garden’s resurrection ties setting to theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim unprogrammed wonder—is signaled early and tightened when Elowen chooses to unstrap despite unknown cost. Escalation is one sustained deepening rather than multiple reversals. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens: density of light and thaw increases until meaning reconfigures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the keystone’s glow versus automated auroras; no explicit moralizing. Final image of petals floating upward reweights “sacred in the simple” without statement. Subtext resides in silence after the light surge. Avoids tidy binaries: automation is not evil, merely insufficient.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that mirrors Elowen’s tentative steps. Perceptual signature—filtered through muted gleams and whispering shadows—remains consistent. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Occasional elevated diction (“architectural whimsy”) slightly strains POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences advance both atmosphere and plot. Figurative language is selective—no purple overload. Minor scaffold: “brilliant dimness” repeated twice within four lines. Otherwise clean, with strong verbs anchoring action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of solarpunk automation critique with quiet mythic quest. Mist walking and keystone glow feel inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky. Specificity of “lingering luminance” versus programmed aurora avoids generic tropes. Risk in lyric mode pays off via resonant closure.</comment>
