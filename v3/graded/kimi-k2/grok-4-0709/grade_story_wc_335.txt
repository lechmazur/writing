<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—archival detachment vs. fierce mentorship—are dramatized in her circling Kael and the backward-step tic; Kael’s mirrored retreat shows earned absorption of her guidance. The final smile and shard archiving crystallize her cost: she must let the student go. Minor slip: “mentor resilience quietly” is slightly label-speak mid-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kael steps through the reopened portal, Elara’s backward steps cease, and the swing resumes—visible cost of solitude returned. Causal lens holds: each beat (tea-leaf reading → shadow lesson → annotation) tightens Kael’s path to reversal. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The forgotten library’s dust, cracked window, and creaking boards constrain movement and mood; the playground swing outside threads through beginning, middle, end, recharging the final image. Micro-setting (shadow in glass vial) directly shapes Kael’s choice. Sensory detail is selective, never catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Kael’s chance to reverse exile—tightens via tea-leaf geometry and shadow-taming test; each beat raises the price of arrogance. Final choice to confront his past is his own, with visible cost of leaving Elara behind. Escalation is causal and sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of resilience-through-fracture emerges from mirrored shards, tea triangles, and the reversible shadow; no moralizing, only charged image of swing restarting. Subtext in Elara’s backward steps and Kael’s involuntary mimicry deepens the idea without statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical yet precise—“dust motes danced like forgotten dreams” teaches the pattern early and pays off in the hush at close. POV stays locked to Elara; Kael’s interiority shown only through gesture and speech. Rhythm modulates with pressure, no head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, action, and arc. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“repository,” “ethereal wisp”) fits archivist POV. Final paragraph cadence slows to crystallize closure without slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Reversible exile via tea-leaf geometry and trapped playground shadow is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; tropes of mentor and prodigy are re-forged through shard-mirror archive. Risky lyric compression taught early and paid off. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
