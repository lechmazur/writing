<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“her breath caught in the tone of hushed thunder”), but the arc leans on psychometric exposition rather than active contradiction; the final choice to “release” unused love is more stated than dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s realization reweights her own unused love under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the film-strip map and final “symphony” image crystallize the before/after. Causality is coherent, though the middle incubation sequence is more lyrical than driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The projection booth is textured with projector heat, dust motes, and reel stacks that constrain movement and incubation; the film strip itself becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean and sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s focused gaze.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locating and reclaiming unused love—is signaled early and deepens through psychometric discovery; the tightening occurs when Elara grasps that her own love is archived, foreclosing passive nostalgia. Cost is felt conceptually but not yet paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of love’s persistence in overlooked spaces emerges organically from Harlan’s letters and Elara’s spatial imagination; the final image of “symphony of the heart” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext operates in the grain of the film and the hush of thunder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet anchored in Elara’s perceptual signature—cinematic metaphors, spatial mapping, and restrained diction. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. Purposeful compression (“incubate… hatch”) teaches the pattern and pays off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, but figurative layering occasionally overloads mid-paragraph (“ink into parchment… infinite theater”). No loops or scaffold; sentence variety sustains momentum. A few near-mixed metaphors (“storm of revelation whispering”) nudge clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fusion of psychometry, vintage cinema, and spatial imagination feels fresh; goodbye letters etched on test frames is a non-obvious conceit. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens resonance without gimmickry. Minor echoes of “ghosts of celluloid dreams” verge on familiar.</comment>
