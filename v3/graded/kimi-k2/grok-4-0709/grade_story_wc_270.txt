<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's insurgency and plant-telepathy root every move; telepathy directly enables each beat—finding the kite, guiding through lava, decoding by plant-memory. The embryo cradled at climax crystallizes her renegade motive, earned by prior stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Closure lands via submerged birth: a Resonant Reconfiguration charging the clan’s trajectory. Causal chain (kite→script→dive→release) holds without holes; “warm water dissolved the resin in a swirl of golden flecks” shows literal cost enacted on page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Sulfurous mist, basalt perch, scalding springs are felt through Elara’s skin; volcanic landscape constrains her dive path and determines the safe grotto. Final “hot springs seemed to sigh” re-coils the setting as witness to evolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—evolution or ossification of tradition—tightens when kite reveal threatens elder order; unsealing forces Elara to risk excommunication. Micro costs (scalded hands, social rupture) compound, not resolved by luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of “intentional evolution versus ancestral stasis” arises from concrete events; final image of the genetically gifted child in volcanic light re-themes old wisdom as mutable responsibility, without overt sermon or label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Omniscient lyric third-person sustains an elder’s perceptual signature—“wrinkled hands clenched in quiet defiance,” steam rising “like forgotten dreams.” Occasional over-rich phrase (“hummed in her mind”) nudges purple yet remains purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Vivid, economical; “bubbles popped like secrets surfacing” is earned. Few scaffolds but several stacked metaphors in one high-heat moment create slight density drag. Overall propulsion strong, no syntax glitches.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Combines geyser-infused grandma lore with bio-engineered destiny; volcanic bioluminescent embryo is startling yet inevitable. Syntheses rare without gimmickry; final image re-casts ancestral myth as living future.</comment>
