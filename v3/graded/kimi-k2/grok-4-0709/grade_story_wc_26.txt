<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the river-stone grounding and “luminous regret” register in body and choice. The final binding of her own freed shadow carries visible cost—she is “forever changed”—but the causality of that cost is slightly smoothed by summary rather than dramatized contradiction, keeping it just shy of 9.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shadow becomes guardian, hope’s shape is re-secured, and Elara’s regret is the felt price. Causal chain (her past dream → unbound shadow → archival comparison → binding ritual) holds cleanly under a Causal lens. One hairline slip: the “luminous regret” in the final line is told more than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Blooming Library is sensuously anchored—“walls alive with vines that blossomed in hues of twilight and dawn”—and the floating architecture constrains movement and ritual space. Micro-setting (river stone at chamber center) directly shapes the binding act. A fraction more orientation on spatial choreography during the ritual would have nudged it to 9.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the shape of hope”—is signaled early and tightened when the unbound shadow begins eroding archived dreams. Escalation is single-track but effective: archival comparison → recognition of personal authorship → binding with cost. The price (confronting her own regret) is legible, though the beat is compressed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: hope’s preservation demands owning one’s regret. The river stone’s return in the final image reweights the opening “earth’s steadfastness” into a guardian emblem. No moralizing; the luminous regret lingers as earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“petals unfurled in luminous regret”—with a perceptual signature attuned to dusk’s nuances. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical without clutter; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One minor loop—“softly deliberate” appears three times in close succession—dulls the edge slightly. Otherwise rhythm, clarity, and propulsion are exemplary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The dream-share era, living library, and regret-fed shadow synthesize into a fresh mythic lens. The personal origin of the shadow retroactively transforms the premise without gimmickry. Specificity of “twilight and dawn” blooms and crystalline orbs anchors the invention.</comment>
