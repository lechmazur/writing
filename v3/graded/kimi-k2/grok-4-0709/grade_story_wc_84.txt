<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s yearning for home is vivid, but her interiority leans on stock phrases (“perpetual surprise” repeated) and the pilgrim’s pressure is too gentle to force a visible cost. The final beat—her decision to pilot home—reads as inevitable rather than earned by prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the completed chip projects the frequency, reconfiguring Elara’s options (Charged Poise). Causal chain holds—each shard pulled tightens the next beat—though the pilgrim’s arrival feels slightly convenient rather than compelled.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The observatory’s dusk light and stone arches constrain movement and mood; the drone’s glow against twilight charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Elara’s pilot gaze, anchoring spatial logic without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled early and escalates as each shard narrows the gap. Cost is implied (time, risk of void travel) but not viscerally felt on the page, keeping it from the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of fragmented identity seeking wholeness emerges through the chip’s missing molds and Elara’s war-torn home; no overt moralizing. Final holographic letters reweight the premise with quiet resonance, though the pilgrim’s rites verge on thematic exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control (“brilliant dimness,” “luminous threads”) that modulates under pressure. POV stays locked to Elara’s sharp, surprised perception; occasional elevated diction (“celestial printers”) slightly drifts from her lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, each sentence advancing image or beat. Minor loop—“perpetual surprise” thrice—dulls edge; one mixed metaphor (“secrets half-revealed” vs. “fading light danced”) nicks clarity. Otherwise clean, vivid, and read-aloud ready.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: drone cartography meets archaic typefounding, star trails as data archaeology. Tropes are grounded in tactile detail; the pilgrim’s robes of stardust could verge on cliché but are saved by specificity. One clear inflection—letters becoming star-maps—feels inevitable.</comment>
