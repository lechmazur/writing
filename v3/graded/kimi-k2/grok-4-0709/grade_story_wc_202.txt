<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“weight lift,” “warm in her hand”), but the childhood backstory is delivered in a single reflective block that never loops back to alter her tactics; the final choice feels pre-ordained rather than freshly compelled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cascade of light reweights the premise, giving voice to the silenced with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each painting adds density until the final cadence shift—though the causal chain from “seek through hidden details” to actual unfastening is lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The alchemist’s market is rendered in selective, sensory strokes that constrain movement (ropes, sway, floating canvases) and charge the final image; the lighthouse lens fragment itself functions as micro-setting that literally bends perception, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early and tightens through each painting; the final release of voices narrows options to “remember or forget,” with visible cost in the market’s hush. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elara’s specific labor; the ending’s non-literal answer (histories now audible) reweights prior material without moralizing. The ambiguity of “eternal instant” lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled, with rhythmic variation that accelerates under pressure. Perceptual signature is distinct (“elusively tangible,” “impossible colors”) and consistent; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language clusters in low-pressure exposition, not in the closure beat. One minor paraphrase loop (“hidden details…anchors of intuition”) costs −0.2; otherwise clean, propulsive, and vivid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar motifs (lighthouse, lost sailors) are transformed through the painter-alchemist frame and the literal unfastening of time via art. The synthesis feels inevitable and specific to this voice.</comment>
