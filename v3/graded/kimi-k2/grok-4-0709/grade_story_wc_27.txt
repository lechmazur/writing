<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s barefoot stance, tactile star-seeking, and the quiet “unorthodox confidence” are embodied and consistent; the climactic choice to channel intent into the stone carries earned weight. Motivation is clear but leans declared (“to discover meaning”) rather than revealed through sharper contradiction; minor deduction for interiority that occasionally lapses into thematic statement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drive is situational/lyric: a deepening of pattern rather than causal because-plotting. Orientation is secure within ~70 words, closure occurs as Resonant Reconfiguration (charged poise with communal cost). The ending beat broadcasts revived hope and reconfigures meaning while leaving space consequences felt, satisfying closure rules.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ruined spaceport serves as both literal obstacle and conceptual echo of ruin-to-rebirth. Bare feet gripping oil-stained concrete, broken hulls, the vibrating stone—each constrains choice and charges the final image; a shade more sensory specificity at the climactic pulse would push it above 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the need to end the “lull” and reignite resistance. Tension grows texturally: debris is cleared, hum climbs from lullaby to thunderous serenity. One visible intensification—communication nodes awaken—narrows options and changes knowledge, meeting escalation under an accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging hope from ruin crystallizes organically through Elara’s barefoot refusal to abandon ruined dreams. Message emerges through pattern rather than proclamation, but the final “roar of revival” flirts with overt summary (-0.3). Subtext mostly carried in embodied action; could sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric-poetic with consistent telescopic diction (“celestial tapestry,” “skeletal guardians”). Rhythm breathes with the action: long inhalations of description, short punctuated clauses when the hum strikes. Slight register drift into theatrical flourish undercuts raw immediacy of the barefoot concrete grip (-0.2).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is image-dense with few true loops; occasional stacked modifiers (“thunderous serenity,” “serene intensity”) flirt with overwriting but remain legible. One paraphrase echo (“humming began softly... swelled with serene intensity”) slows the pulse (-0.2). Otherwise crisp choreography and sensory layering.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar “found artifact restores defeated rebels” scaffold is refreshed by the spaceport-as-graveyard and barefoot astronomer. Opera-stargazer conflation is fresh, yet the cosmic-stone-messaging device risks convenient mysticism (-0.4). The synthesis feels organic enough, not gimmick, but not wholly new territory.</comment>
