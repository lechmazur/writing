<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s contradictory impulses (wanderlust vs. need for home) are embodied in the moment he pockets the compass and chooses the poles; the final renunciation carries visible cost (“weight of his broken past lifting”). Interiority is specific, but the partner’s absence keeps relational stakes off-page, limiting crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is an Earned Stasis: he turns inland, foreclosing the sea-path with felt cost (“quiet realignment”). Causal chain holds—compass misalignment → pole navigation → step-by-step reconciliation. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity. Minor drift: “gravitating” used twice without tightening the beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Coastal launch anchors who/where/when in the first 60 words; dunes, docks, and humming wires are filtered through Elias’s maritime gaze. The utility poles evolve from background to active beacons, constraining his route. Salt breeze and golden light mirror internal shift without cliché overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—align heart and action—is signaled early and tightened when each pole becomes a counted regret. Agency drives escalation: every step inland narrows future options. Cost is visible in the final image (“weight lifting”). No external antagonist, but internal conflict suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of reconciliation versus restlessness emerges through concrete action (poles vs. compass) rather than statement. Final image of terrestrial journey reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the humming wires and warming compass is effective, though partner’s absence keeps relational dimension abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and salt-stained; perceptual signature (“salt-and-pepper hair,” “mocking constellations”) is character-specific. Rhythm modulates with emotional crests. No dialogue, so no register clash. Occasional elevated diction (“merrily melancholic”) risks label-speak but stays within Elias’s reflective register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“sandcastle against the tide”) are apt and brief. Density is high—each sentence advances image or choice. Minor register bump at “conceptual repricing” level abstraction in “redefine his course,” but does not stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Navigation-by-utility-poles is a fresh, grounded twist on the lost-sailor trope. Specific maritime detail and the compass-to-poles inversion feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate but coherent; no gimmickry. Could be transplanted, but the coastal texture and compass history anchor it.</comment>
