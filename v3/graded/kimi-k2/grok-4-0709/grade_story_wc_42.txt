<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s luminous ache and need to “harness the ephemeral” are embodied in the spinning clock and trembling dome, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the leaf-fall beat finally crystallizes motive into action with visible cost, yet earlier beats lean on lyrical summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the restructured clock pulses with the moon, the photograph freezes the leaf, and the ache transmutes to peace while the dome still threatens collapse—felt cost is legible. Causal chain is lyric-elliptical yet coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Observatory dome, spinning clock, and ancient oak are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains Elias’s choices; the leaf’s fall and moonlight charge the final image. Spatial anchors are clear early; environment mirrors internal stakes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the ephemeral against collapse—is signaled early; tremors tighten options, and the leaf-fall moment forces the decisive restructuring with visible risk. Escalation is steady under Accumulative lens; cost (possible loss of dome and life’s work) remains palpable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of transience versus permanence emerges through the clock, leaf, and photograph; no moralizing. Final image reframes the luminous ache as radiant peace without explicit statement, inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, elevated register remains consistent with sage-poet focalizer; perceptual signature is distinct (“white beard flowing like comet trails”). No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture and rhythm, which hold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“luminous ache woven from beauty and pain”) flirt with overwriting but serve the Accumulative cadence. No loops or scaffolds; rhythm modulates with tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of astrophotography, antique clock, and seismic observatory feels fresh; the leaf-fall trigger for restructuring time is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Premise is specific enough to resist template swap.</comment>
