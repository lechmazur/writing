<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “quietly driven” trait is dramatized through nightly postcard study and dawn pilgrimages to the cathedral window. The lineage of loss is credible, and her final mural choice carries visible cost. Minor slip: the phrase “reckon with it all” edges toward label-speak in the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s new mural crystallizes the stake with felt cost. Causality holds: postcards → cathedral window → final insight. One transition (winter→autumn) is clean and taught early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cathedral window and amber pavilion are vivid, selective, and purpose-driven; the etched glass constrains decoding tactics and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s artist eye. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why night flowers bloom—tightens through postcard decoding and glass revelation; the final mural forecloses the question with earned cost. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: beauty in darkness, inherited grief, the courage to exist unseen. Final image of the new mural offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic drift; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Elara’s perceptual signature—color, glass, hush. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Diction stays within artist’s lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective, not purple. No loops, synonym churn, or mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports momentum. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: night-bloom botany + family grief + stained-glass decoding. Specific details (postcards, etched jasmine) transform familiar motifs. Risky lyric structure pays off in closure.</comment>
