<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her calm defiance is embodied in every pirouette and dice roll—but the story leans on lyrical summary rather than on-page contradiction; the final dance is earned yet the cost feels more poetic than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the dice sequence unlocks the lab and frees encoded colleagues, a decisive change with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each journal entry and dance tightens the pattern until the final cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken lab is evoked with selective, sensory precision; the hangman’s dice and floating debris constrain movement and choice. Micro-setting (her body as cipher) charges the final image, though some spatial anchors drift mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape via encoded vulnerability—is signaled early and escalates through nightly dice rolls and dances. One meaningful tightening occurs when the final roll confirms the unlock; cost is felt as the lab’s ghosts ascend, yet the price to Elara herself remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting fear into strength emerges organically from ciphered journal verses and bodily code; the final ascent reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext lingers in the freed digital ghosts—an unresolved echo that complicates triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic compression that mirrors code; perceptual signature is consistent. Occasional elevated diction (“probabilistic poetry”) momentarily lifts out of Elara’s plausible lexicon but does not rupture immersion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical, propelling momentum; figurative layering is purposeful. Minor synonym loops (“coded armor,” “coded journal”) and one mixed metaphor (“spider-web days”) slightly dull the final third, preventing a higher band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptography, dance, and submerged gothic; the dice-as-algorithm device feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though the premise nods to familiar escape-room tropes.</comment>
