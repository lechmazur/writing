<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s grief-driven ritual is credibly embodied; the micro-choice to steep the locket in ink crystallizes his arc. Interiority is concrete (“haunted euphoria building in his chest”), but the covenant’s regeneration feels slightly abstract, blurring cost. Still, the final beat—tucking the locket against his heart—earns a credible renunciation of forgetting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the steeped photo rebinds Mira’s memory into living bond. Causal chain (ink → memory prompt → ritual → spectral presence) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One transition (twilight surrendering to night) is legible; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Jetty’s salt-spray and pollen-charged air constrain the ritual’s timing and heighten mystical charge. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The walnut-ink flask and sea-rose scent return in the final image, recharging stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving ephemeral love against oblivion—is signaled early and tightened by twilight’s deadline. Steeping the locket is the decisive, irreversible act that forecloses forgetting. Cost is felt in the “joyous ache” and spectral chill.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory’s weight vs. its erasure. Subtext lives in gesture (uncorking ink, whispering vows) rather than statement. Final steeped image reweights the covenant without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrid prose is consistent, with rhythmic control (“bruised purples,” “ghostly presence”). POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature—archivist’s synesthetic attention to scent and pigment—holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid yet disciplined; only minor loops (“proximate cause” repeated). Metaphors cohere; no mixed vehicles. High information density; each sentence advances atmosphere or action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</comment><comment>Familiar grief-ritual trope is refreshed through walnut-ink alchemy and jetty botanica. Specificity of scent, pigment, and twilight timing feels non-generic. Risky lyricism pays off in spectral closure.</comment>
