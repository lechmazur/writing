<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s pacifism and cataloguing obsession are embodied in every micro-choice; the final forgiveness is earned by the prior refusal to fight and the costly act of listening. Interiority is vivid, though occasional “theatrical” self-awareness nudges it toward performance rather than raw contradiction. The estranged brother’s pain is rendered through recovered silences, not exposition, satisfying the crucible test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tuned frequency layers density until the clasp yields, reconfiguring meaning with the brother’s whispered envy. Closure is a Charged Poise—the diary’s spectral confession reweights Elias’s lifelong stance, cost visible in his tears and the ledger’s new entry. No orientation drift; causality is felt as resonance rather than plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The workshop’s starlit clutter and brass resonator constrain every move; the clasp itself becomes micro-setting that must be coaxed, not forced. Sensory detail is selective—metallic frost, moth-wing hush—filtered through Elias’s obsession. Final image of the first firework links external sky to internal shift, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the lost confessions—tightens with each frequency band; the silence of betrayal and loneliness escalate emotional cost. Agency remains Elias’s: each dial twist is a pacifist’s act of non-violent excavation. The final whisper forecloses the option of permanent estrangement, price paid in reopened grief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of empathy-through-silence emerges organically from the tuning process; no moralizing summary intrudes. The brother’s “I envied your peace” reweights every prior refusal to fight, crystallizing the concept without abstraction. Subtext resides in metallic hush and velvet texture, not commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, modulating from lyrical cataloguer to trembling listener. “The hush of regret…frayed velvet” exemplifies perceptual signature. Occasional theatrical flourishes are consistent with Elias’s character, never breaking POV. Rhythm accelerates with the rising hum, then softens into the whispered payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language serves the soundscape motif without clutter. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances tuning, memory, or cost. Minor register drift (“theatrical sincerity”) is voice-motivated and paid off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—pacifist sound-engineer of silence—is fresh, synthesized through antique compasses, herbal elixirs, and radio lore. The diary clasp as emotional resonator transforms a familiar trope into specific, irreparable loss. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final whispered envy, reconfiguring the entire backstory.</comment>
