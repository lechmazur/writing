<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her heartbeat ache, the embodied stillness—but the contradiction between her stated goal (map heartbeats) and the actual ritual (seal starlight into a plate) is never dramatized; the final map feels gifted rather than earned by her flaw or choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the luminous map pulses with felt cost (frozen tears). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of discarded objects and starlight reweights the stake. One seamless scene, anchored early, no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The crater orchard is not backdrop; its frost, silence, and wilted petals are harvested into the mandala, then fused into the map. Micro-setting (the brass plate) becomes the final image. Sensory selection mirrors Elara’s narrowed focus under eclipse pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—translate love’s rhythm into a path—tightens once: the eclipse window forces the irreversible sealing. Cost is visible (frozen tears, spent starlight). Agency drives the escalation; coincidence only frames, never rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of mapping absence emerges through concrete particulars: discarded remnants, captive starlight, frozen orchard. Final image reweights the premise—love’s rhythm now externalized as living map—without moralizing. Subtext carried in gesture and object, not statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elara’s alchemical gaze. Syntax modulates with eclipse tension—long breaths, then flares of flash-paper. No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers image, tool, and emotion. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“celestial fury,” “forgotten promises”) skirts purple but serves the lyric register. Final third remains clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fusion of alchemy, cartography, and eclipse ritual feels fresh; the heartbeat-to-map conceit is specific to Elara’s loss. Discarded objects transformed into stellar cartography is a non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric compression pays off in the charged final image.</comment>
