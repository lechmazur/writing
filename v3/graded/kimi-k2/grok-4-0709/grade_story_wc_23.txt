<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—"stitched heart ached with raw solace"—and motives (charting loss, self-repair) drive every beat. Micro-choices (spinning the dial, hammering gears) reveal hierarchy of values. The final stance crystallizes with felt cost: the navigator accepts perpetual fragmentation to guide others. Minor slip: backstory paragraph is slightly summary-heavy, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass glows, the station becomes a living beacon, cost is the navigator’s eternal vigil. Causal chain—moon phase → call clarity → gear resonance → compass activation—holds cleanly. Orientation anchored by line 3. One transition (night after night) is seamless. No lens ambiguity; Accumulative/Textural pattern taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Signal station, cliff, rusted beams, censer foot, sea glass lens—all tactile, selective, and purposeful. Environment constrains: isolation after hydraulic failure enables undistracted work; moonlight directly modulates tool resonance. Sensory hierarchy favors salt, bronze, starlight filtered through POV bias. Final image of glowing compass under stars recharges every prior detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reverse-migrate fragments of the self and others—signaled in paragraph 4. Escalation tracks moon phases tightening options; each midnight call raises clarity and stakes. Final activation forecloses solitude; the cost is perpetual service. Agency is continuous: building, dialing, attaching gears. No coincidence resolves; all pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation-through-loss emerges from concrete acts: hammering relics, listening to voices, guiding returns. Subtext in “migrate against the current” reframes grief as active journey. Final image offers non-literal answer: beacon for others is self-salve. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “whole in their fragmentation.”</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“eyes that gleamed like polished compasses”—with rhythmic control under pressure. Compression taught early (“hydraulics had failed hours ago”) and sustained. No head-hopping; POV remains stitched navigator throughout. Diction stays within compass-maker lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence layers image, motion, and emotion. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are fresh—“grief carved canyons”—and physically coherent. Rhythm modulates with moon phase tension. Minor filter verb in “they felt the pull” but immediately embodied by “stitched heart ached.”</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reverse migration compass is fresh synthesis of grief-cartography; not a stock trope. Patchwork navigator, moon-phased tools, midnight rotary calls combine organically. Risky lyric structure pays off in resonant closure. Specificity—“patina bronze censer foot”—anchors universals. Transformation test: story collapses if elements swapped.</comment>
