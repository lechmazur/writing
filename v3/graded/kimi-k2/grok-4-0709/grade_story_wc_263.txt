<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s arc is internal and lyric, but her concrete micro-choice—plotting each falling star—grounds motive; yet the emotional cost of this renewal is felt more as tone than embodied consequence on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Strong accumulative design: mapped star-traces accrue into the final “map of liberation.” Closure lands conceptually but lacks visible constraint or price; causality reads associative rather than forced trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The archway, sextant, and aurora serve as micro-settings that constrain posture and attention; the sextant especially reweights in the final image, holding both memory and mechanical precision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Stakes—“free trapped creativity”—are signaled early and escalated through the accumulating star-traces; each mapped trajectory tightens the abstract stake into tangible release, satisfying the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Stardust-as-identity emerges organically from traced orbits; however, a faint echo of thesis (“she was … a fragment of the universe’s grand narrative”) slips toward statement rather than earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyrical voice is consistent and sensorily textured; phrases like “shadowed rapture” and “auroral glow” are idiosyncratic rather than generic. Distinct perceptual signature holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Almost zero loop or scaffold; only rare redundant phrasing slows cadence. Compression of “another falling star…” repetition is deliberate, pattern-taught, and paid off.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Blending antique astronomy with cosmic ancestry feels fresh, but the “moonstruck dreamer” and auroral arch risk familiar iconography; specificity of the brass etchings and the metronome of meteors rescues it.</comment>
