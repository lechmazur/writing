<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his grief and conviction embodied in the cork’s warmth—but the reunion beat is too sudden; Mira’s survival and arrival feel externally granted rather than earned by Elias’s agency, blunting the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the reunion reweights the premise that “whispers travel farther.” Yet the causal chain is strained—Mira’s miraculous return is coincidence-driven, not causally linked to the cork’s magic under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The cobalt lighthouse, dawn-cooled air, and residual garden scent are selective and atmospheric; the cork as micro-setting constrains Elias’s ritual and charges the final embrace, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—proving intent can reach the lost—is clear early; pressure tightens as Elias performs the ritual. However, escalation hinges on an off-stage miracle rather than a narrowing of options or visible cost, limiting depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: the power of subtle intent versus brute force. The garden-scent motif reweights at reunion, offering a resonant, non-moralizing answer. No overt thesis is stated, preserving ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature attuned to scent, temperature, and vibration. Syntax modulates with emotional rise; no head-hopping or register drift. The final image crystallizes in charged poise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, propelling the ritual beat. Occasional stacked metaphors (“screaming tenderness”) flirt with overwriting but serve the tone. No loops or scaffolds; clarity remains intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—using a cork’s residual magic to summon via scent—is fresh and specific. While the lost-at-sea return trope is familiar, the sensory mechanism and inversion of “shouts vs whispers” transform it into a memorable inflection.</comment>
