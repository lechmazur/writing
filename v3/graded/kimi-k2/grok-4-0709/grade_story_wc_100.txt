<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s weary stubbornness is embodied in every soaked step and clenched grip on the lens; the interior contradiction—exhaustion vs. refusal to abandon the dead—drives each micro-choice. The moment he compresses himself into the impossible void to wrest the last spirit, the cost (body, breath, time) is palpable and earned. No stock phrases; the voice stays particular to a drowned caretaker. Only a slight drift toward abstract “rest” keeps it from 8.8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s stillness is no longer chased but “lingers, eternal,” and Elias’s slumped exhaustion is the visible price. Causal chain—package → lens → impossible spaces → mending cracks—holds without gaps. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity. A hairline slip: the dream-given method feels lightly external, not fully seeded in prior causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drowned library is not backdrop but pressure system: algae glow guides sightlines, infiltrating water sets tempo, impossible geometries constrain tactics. The broken lens doubles as micro-setting that refracts signals and later mends, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy stays filtered through Elias’s undertaker priorities. One minor spatial blur when “narrow void” is first entered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grant the dead a permanent address—is signaled early and tightened when Elias chooses to occupy ever-tighter voids, trading bodily ease for each soul’s peace. Escalation is causal and visible: each spirit laid to rest warms and mends the lens, marking cumulative cost. No coincidence resolves; agency remains Elias’s alone. Slight reserve because the final cost is more exhaustion than irreversible loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of rest versus unrest emerges through concrete acts—lens, void, chant—not statement. The final image of stillness “lingering” reweights the opening “chased stillness” without moralizing. Subtext in the mending cracks implies redemption through stubborn service. One soft echo of “permanent address” edges toward label but is absorbed by embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is salted, sodden, and precise: “drowned willow,” “ghostly fireflies,” “time folded like wet paper.” Syntax lengthens under fatigue, compresses in the void, mirroring bodily strain. No head-hop; perception stays locked to Elias’s undertaker sensorium. Distinctive enough to risk the lyric leaps without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; every sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors are controlled and purposeful—“fractured ice,” “curtain of water.” No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minor filter verb cluster (“he began,” “he started”) in one beat keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The premise—undertaker in a drowned library using a broken lighthouse lens to map ghosts into impossible shelves—feels inevitable yet wholly fresh. Tropes (restless spirits, hidden rooms) are transformed through Elias’s stubborn specificity and the lens’s literal refraction of grief. Risky compression into dream-logic voids pays off in the final mended light. No derivative echoes.</comment>
