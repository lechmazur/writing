<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s reluctant-caretaker role is embodied in her trudging boots and “graceless murmur,” but her interiority is mostly summary (“reluctance burned like a slow fire”). The inherited duty to guide travelers is stated rather than dramatized; the final turn—choosing to stay—rests on lineage rather than a fresh contradiction exposed in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Causal chain is clear: frost deadline → spot pilgrims → use nut/blueprint → guide them out → nut spent. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she stays, orchard still cursed, cost visible in nut’s dust. One transition (orchard to cliff edge) is legible; orientation anchors by line 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Setting is vivid and selective: “mossy earth that clung…like a desperate lover,” “mechanical birds with razor wings.” The cliff-labyrinth constrains every move; the orchard’s thorns and frost clock shape tactics. Final image of sparkling frost on leaves recharges the opening mood with added cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—save pilgrims before frost—tightens once when the nut is cracked and the wind-carved path becomes the only option. Agency is indirect but causal; the price (nut destroyed, curse still active) is legible. No escalation after the path is set, but one meaningful deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of inherited obligation versus personal escape emerges through action, not statement. Final image of Elara turning “back to her cursed grove” reframes the graceless beauty motif as both burden and identity. Subtext lingers: salvation for others, exile for self.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured and consistent: “offhandedly exact” diction (“Shift left by three degrees…”) fits the POV. Sensory filtering is character-specific (“petals falling like clumsy snowflakes”). No dialogue, so no drift; prose rhythm modulates with tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective. Minor loop: “graceless beauty” appears twice without fresh inflection. Otherwise, sentences advance scene or atmosphere; no mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Familiar gothic-fantasy tropes (cursed orchard, clockwork guardians) are re-angled through wind-guided, touch-less navigation. The blueprint-as-spell mechanic feels fresh; the nut’s single-use sacrifice avoids deus-ex-machina. Specificity of “impressions without touching” lifts the concept above template.</comment>
