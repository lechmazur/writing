<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Elena’s layered interiority—translator’s hyper-awareness, anesthetic wooziness, shrewd-calm mask—plays across every beat. Her micro-choices (approach the boy, offer the coral, trace the cast) escalate congruently with motivation and theme. Amir’s wary press mirrors her trauma, creating a crucible for shared vulnerability. The handing-off of the coral at the end forecloses a path for both with tangible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Single-scene, one transition (the drift into anesthetic blur) remains spatially and temporally clear under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The ending reweights meaning via “wounds grow roots, then flowers” rendered concrete by the coral transfer—Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The atrium’s “fog that clung to stone floors,” body-shifting light, and the coral’s tactile ridges constrain movement and signal emotion. Weather and architecture function as a living filter, tightening perceptions under anesthetic haze and charging the coral hand-off. No excess exposition; every detail serves texture or choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: transform grief into shared hope. Anesthetic mist and child’s fear intensify through tactile unraveling of cast poems. Choice to gift coral crystallizes options, leaving both permanently altered. Agency stays with Elena; no external coincidence rescues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of “grafting new growth onto ruin” is never asserted—only embodied in coral-roots transforming cast scratches into poem. Coral loop recharged in final image reframes earlier grotesque scars as fertile soil. Resonant without preachiness; moral ambiguity of survivor’s guilt remains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lotus-tinged lyricism sustained—“fading light filtered like whispered secrets”—without head-hop or voice collapse under stress. Distinct perceptual signature maintains controlled compression and purposeful elision tied to drug blur. Dialogue spare but culturally ground Amir.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Dense, rhythmic, loop-free prose. Metaphors stay physical and coherent: brain-coral grooves like tangled minds. No filler or scaffold. Final coral-on-palm image crystallizes earlier motifs with precision and tidal meter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar traumas (child refugee, translator scar) lifted into fresh fusion by brain-coral-forged linkage. Risky lyric anesthetic lens paid off; ending image feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
