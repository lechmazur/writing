<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interior contradiction—scholarly discipline vs. inherited curse—drives every micro-choice; the crystallizing skin is embodied, not labeled, and the final rune-scars carry visible cost. Motivation (“transform scars into stories”) is present from the first paragraph and intensifies through the ritual. Minor slip: the superstition method feels slightly under-motivated in the moment of crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causality holds: stress triggers crystals → crystals block ritual → superstition offers release → runes rewrite scars. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing narrative runes reweight her past with felt cost (loss of the literal scars). Orientation is immediate; lens is causal and consistent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The floating rock, obsidian table, and storm breath are vivid, selective, and constrain choice (isolation, precarious footing). The crow quill functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. One minor drift: “saturated hush” is repeated without fresh sensory angle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can she complete the ceremony without shattering—tightens once when crystals bloom. Agency is her decision to risk the superstition; cost is the irreversible transformation of scars into glowing runes. Escalation is linear but sufficient for 600–800 words.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: trauma rewritten as narrative armor. The crow-feather superstition and spiral rune carry subtext without sermonizing. Final image reframes scars as luminous stories—earned, non-moralizing resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control matching the held-breath pacing. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara’s scholarly precision tinged with childhood awe. No POV drift or filter-verb clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers action, memory, and sensation. Metaphors (“crystals bloomed like frost on glass”) are precise. One paraphrase loop (“held breath” variations) mildly dulls momentum mid-scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: storm-cursed rune scholar on a floating tea platform using childhood superstition to alchemize scars into living text. The crow quill reprise feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risky lyricism pays off in the final image.</comment>
