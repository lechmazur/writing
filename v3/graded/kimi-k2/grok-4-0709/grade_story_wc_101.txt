<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority (“built intergenerational support…”) and micro-choices (anonymous midnight runs → open declaration) create one consistent arc of motive and visible cost (abandoning anonymity). Emotional embodiment is concrete: he weighs the bell’s cool against his palm rather than stating “nervous.” An earned renunciation that stays consistent under pressure.</question>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure arrives as a Charged Poise: the communal gathering, bell chime, and announced unity crystallise the altered community dynamic; the price—sacrifice of secrecy, now shared labor—is felt. Causality holds (anonymous gifts → trust → revealed source → joint midnight harvests) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but a slight soft landing (“quiet triumph over isolation”) reads more poetic afterimage than sharp final choice.</question>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Terra-cotta arbor, dust paths, ridge vantage, and flickering lamps are selective, textured, and tie directly to Elias’s final vantage and gathering call; they constrain choice (signal strength for bell, communal sightline) and linger in the final image. Only minor clichés (“starved flow of goods and hope”) keep it from 8.5.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Intergenerational cooperation against sanctions is the singular stake, signalled early. Pressure escalates on sanctions tightening; cost is visible when youths murmur division. The decisive call from the arbor openly forecloses further anonymity and requires new collective midnight labor. Agency stays with Elias, no off-page shortcuts.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of hidden solidarity blooming into declared unity emerges organically from the sequence of gifts, secrets, and communal acts instead of sermonising. Subtext of mutual respect survives any moral oversimplification, though the final “quiet triumph over isolation” drifts near platitude, lightly blunting resonance.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited voice is stable and textured: “steps muffled on dusty paths,” “amplified quiet,” “cool silver against his palm.” Repetition of “gently persistent” reads intentional, yet the overall diction never fractures its own music; slight cadence monotony in the closing paragraphs nudges the ceiling.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, propelling, mostly free of loops; occasional scaffold (“gently persistent resolve that whispered”) is mild enough not to obscure causality. A few redundant phrases (“silent gratitude that bound generations in shared resilience”) slip into summary rather than immediate gesture at the edges.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>The small-frame exiled-valley story, anonymously-gift-to-bell-revelation pattern, and quiet collective harvest pivot feels fresh because it stays local and lived-in rather than grandiose. Still a well-tread “leader unites isolated community” arc under sanctions, so the absolute leap to 9.0+ wasn’t earned.</question>
