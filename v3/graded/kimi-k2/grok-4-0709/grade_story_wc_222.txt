<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elarion’s motives (restore honor, playful reverence) are clear and embodied in each swap; the interior contradiction between “chivalrous” and “thief” is named but not dramatized in a micro-choice under pressure. The final bow and escape show earned change, yet the Archmage’s off-stage thaw feels like external absolution rather than a cost Elarion pays.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the swapped pieces reverse the sky’s wrongness (Decisive Change) and the Archmage’s corruption thaws (felt cost). Causal chain holds—each swap triggers cosmic correction—though the Archmage’s instant conversion is slightly convenient. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The spire’s ice, wind, and crystal walls are vivid, selective, and pressure the climb; the pocket sundial’s glow melts a literal path, integrating tool with setting. Final blooming crystals reweight the environment, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mending the sky—is signaled early and tightened by each swapped piece; the final choice forecloses the Archmage’s corrupted game. Cost is visible in the risk of plummet and the Archmage’s fury, though the personal price to Elarion remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of sacred play vs. corrupted control emerges through the chess ritual and the sky’s correction; no explicit moralizing. The ending’s blooming crystals offer a resonant, non-literal reweighting of wonder over rigidity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“frost clung like a jealous lover,” “cautious abandon”—with rhythmic control that accelerates during the swaps. POV remains tightly anchored to Elarion’s sensorium; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and pattern-taught. Minor scaffold—“each swap was a ritual” restates what action shows—but no loops or muddle in peak beats. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The cosmic-chess conceit feels fresh; tropes of noble thief and fallen mage are transformed through playful ritual mechanics. The pocket sundial’s dual role as key and memento is a specific, non-obvious synthesis that charges closure.</comment>
