<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid—her contradictory impulses (rebellion vs. longing) act simultaneously in scene, embodied in the drumming. The final “wondered if it was truly him” crystallizes Earned Stasis with visible emotional cost. Minor slip: “auroral sorrow” edges toward label-speak, but the embodied drumming compensates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the drumming sequence tightens to a resonant reconfiguration where the living pulse may or may not be Lir, foreclosing certainty. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each drumbeat layers density until the cosmos pauses. Cost is legible in the final line’s doubt. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden and auric lagoon are not mere backdrop; the crystalline perch and liquid-gold surface actively constrain Elara’s drumming tactics and mirror her entangled grief. Sensory specificity is selective, urgent, and filtered through her bias. The lagoon’s final swirl recharges the stake, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reviving the shared dream—is signaled early and tightened through escalating drumming that risks neural overstimulation. One meaningful intensification: the lagoon’s harmonic response narrows options to either believe or doubt the echo. Cost is felt in the closing uncertainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-presence emerges organically from the drumming ritual and the lagoon’s mirrored visions. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing: the echo may be self-generated, charging the concept with conceptual cost. Subtext operates in silence after the last beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is Elara’s synesthetic fusion of sound and sorrow. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short percussive fragments accelerate, then the final sentence exhales. No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers sensory or emotional pressure. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (“auroral sorrow”) are few and earned. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, climaxing in the drumming crescendo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The neural-entanglement garden is a fresh synthesis of hard-SF concept and lyric grief. Risky second-person cosmic framing (“the hush of the universe inhaling”) pays off by amplifying the final doubt. Specificity prevents it from feeling like a trope checklist.</comment>
