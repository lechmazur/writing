<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete—his measured grief and analogical mind convincingly inform every micro-choice. The final taste of the fruit and the changed relationship with Mira land as earned, not symbolic shorthand. Only a slight residue of therapeutic self-awareness in the closing sentence blunts full 8+ sharpness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Accumulative lens holds: the density of analogical equations steadily reweights the stakes until the arbor’s pull reconfigures their connection in the final image. Closure arrives as an Earned Stasis—Elias accepts distance with measurable cost. No orientation drift, causal linkage steady.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Arbor’s magnetic field, floating soil, and luminous sapling are fully active: they literally provide the medium and the closure charge. Sensation is selective and filtered through Elias’s translator eye for physics, anchoring the speculative rules without lecture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A single dominant stake—bridge touching distance or abandon it—remains lucid. Pressure escalates by densifying analogies, culminating in a felt renunciation; no coincidences short-cut the cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through pattern: translation work, seed-sapling-fruit growth mirroring memory-grief-new resonance. Avoids didacticism; wisdom stays tethered to tactile particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is finely tuned: the cuneiform lexicon and measured cadence mirror Elias’s scholarly patience without drifting into textbook. Compression in reflective lines tightens rather than slackens, paying off in the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm is deliberate, almost incantatory, yet never repetitive. Occasional near-duplicate metaphor (ink spreading across parchment) slightly softens the last third. Otherwise dense, clean, propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Familiar motifs—ghost wife, celestial orchard—are inverted through translator methodology and granular speculative physics. The cuneiform seed feels freshly specific; the payoff re-anchors universal grief in intellectual rigor, a synthesis not seen elsewhere.</comment>
