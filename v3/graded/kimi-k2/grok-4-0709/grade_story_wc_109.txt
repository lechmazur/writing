<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority is atmospheric but abstract; the oracle’s “mild obsession” is asserted rather than embodied in micro-choices. No contradictory impulse surfaces under pressure, so the final sealing of the booklet feels inevitable rather than earned. Character remains a lyrical vessel more than a pressured agent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the booklet’s sealing crystallizes the map of silence with conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each flake of gold is a pattern beat—but causality between star-fade and map completion is lightly sketched rather than driven. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Storm-tossed fort and single star are vivid, selective, and mirrored in the oracle’s hush. The flaking gold booklet functions as micro-setting, constraining the final action of sealing. Sensory hierarchy favors hush over gale, reinforcing theme without clutter. Spatial anchors remain steady.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving silence before endless night—is signaled early and tightens through star-fade. Yet escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; no visible price or option foreclosure occurs until the final sealing, which feels pre-ordained. Agency is contemplative, not decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of preserving absence emerges organically from the oracle’s mapping ritual. Final image of “ambered hush” reweights prior silences without moralizing. Subtext resides in the flakes’ fall, not exposition. Complexity is quiet but present.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled syntax that mimics hush and flake. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct—oracle attends to “dying embers” and “veined quietude.” Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Register remains elevated but coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional stacked modifiers (“marbled hush,” “ambered void”) verge on excess yet serve texture. No loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports momentum. Figurative language stays coherent; minor drift toward purple never obscures meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—cartographer of silence at world’s end—is fresh, synthesized through specific ritual rather than concept alone. Tropes of oracle and apocalypse are transformed by focus on unsaid space. Risk is stylistic but coherent; no gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
