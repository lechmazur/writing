<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is vivid—his “heart ached” while his “mind methodically planned”—but the emotional contradiction never collides in a single beat; the final choice to seal the letter and leave is rational yet the cost is only asserted, not embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: petal-fall triggers entry, discovery of letter triggers plan, plan triggers closure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s stance crystallizes into “bridge between buried past and enlightened future”—with conceptual cost (truth still buried in chest).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The station’s ivy-choked decay is tactile and constrains movement; the rosebush’s final petal acts as micro-setting object that times the entire quest, charging the closure image of “shedding illusions.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue truth from noble lies—is signaled early and tightens once: the letter’s myth must be reframed, not destroyed. The cost is conceptual (truth remains sealed) but felt through Elias’s resolute departure; one meaningful turn suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of noble lies emerges organically from the letter and station history; final image of ivy “less oppressive” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in the parallels Elias sketches is clear yet avoids didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, erudite yet urgent; perceptual signature filters every detail through Elias’s historian lens (“whispered secrets,” “fading reminder”). No dialogue, so no voice leakage; free-indirect style stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and high density; occasional elevated diction (“ensnared generations,” “crystallized final moment”) skirts purple but stays within POV. No loops or scaffold; one mixed metaphor (“ivy clung like whispered secrets”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Premise—rescuing truth from noble lies via historical parallel rather than confrontation—is fresh; synthesis of medieval letter, wartime station, and modern politics feels inevitable. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
