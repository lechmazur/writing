<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is textured and embodied; the palimpsest needle-work shows micro-choices under pressure. Motivation (distill essence) is dramatized through tactile decoding, not stated. Final renunciation of personal gain carries visible cost—he boards the ferry “unweighted.” Minor slip: “spindrift serenity” edges toward label-speak once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias’s quiet endurance forecloses pursuit of hidden fortune, cost legible in the silence after the last gutter-tick. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of rain, fog, and layered ink tightens until the final drip. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. One micro-turn suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fog-bound crossing is not backdrop but pressure system: mist muffles sound, slows perception, and forces the patient needle-work. Micro-setting (yarn needle as tool/setting hybrid) constrains the only possible action. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true; damp earth and decaying leaves filter through Elias’s gloom-hill familiarity. Final image of lifting fog reconfigures the space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor the distilled promise—signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each overwritten oath raises the cost of misreading. One tightening beat when the final line emerges; no reversals needed. Cost is conceptual (renounced fortune) yet felt in the hush after the last drip.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of protection-over-possession emerges from the layered parchment and Elias’s tactile decoding; no explicit statement. Final image of boarding the ferry unweighted offers non-literal resonance. Subtext in the erased vows lingers without moralizing. One near-slip: “distill complexity into essence” flirts with thesis-speak but is quickly embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—measured, maritime, tactile. Syntax mirrors patient needle-work: long clauses that breathe, then short pricks of perception. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Register stays within Elias’s lexicon; “spindrift,” “palimpsest,” and “percolate” feel earned by occupation and lineage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet limpid; every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with rain’s ticking. One minor scaffold: “like spindrift settling on a serene sea” repeats the earlier simile but serves cadence, not clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: palimpsest-as-inheritance decoded with a yarn needle in a fog-bound ferry queue. Mythic river guardian retooled into quiet ethical reckoning. Risky stillness pays off; nothing feels grafted. Transformation test passes—swap any element and the story collapses.</comment>
