<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is embodied (thumb on buckle, chest pressure) and her contradictory impulses—duty vs. fear of failure—drive the revision. The final choice to tether-parachute is earned by prior muscle-memory drills and carries visible communal cost. Secondary pressure from radio voices is thin but sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: storm clears → radio warning → flawed plan exposed → buckle memory → revised protocol → evacuation. Closure is a Decisive Change with communal cost; the arbor’s survival is left in Charged Poise. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor is vivid (bioluminescent vines, churning clouds) and constrains tactics: height enables tethered drops, updrafts force plan change. Micro-setting of the buckle functions as tool-anchor. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve trust via safe evacuation—is signaled early and tightened when updrafts invalidate the glider plan. One meaningful turn: mass glider → tethered parachute. Cost is communal exposure to wind shear; closure leaves them mid-descent, stakes unresolved but reconfigured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of trust under pressure emerges through action, not statement. Subtext in radio pleading and buckle ritual carries the weight. Final image of descending shadows reweights earlier dread into hope without moralizing. Avoids tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent lyric-crisis, syntactic rhythm tightens under pressure (“click, release, secure”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is tactile and auditory-negative (“soundless echo”). Dialogue minimal but functional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“nocturnal arbor,” “ethereal realm”) slightly drifts from POV lexicon but does not stall momentum. Metaphors are coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Combines sky-dwelling evacuation with muscle-memory engineering in a fresh synthesis. Tropes (chosen one, storm crisis) are grounded in tactile detail. Risky quiet ending pays off with Charged Poise rather than spectacle.</comment>
