<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s mournfully eager drive is embodied in every spectral tug of the cord; the contradiction between lingering grief and active caretaking is dramatized, not labeled. Interiority is concrete—translucent fingers, off-key wind—yet the arc stays ghost-static, renouncing reunion, so the cost is felt but not deepened by a final choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias accepts perpetual exile while the household re-opens to laughter; the cost—his endless vigil—is legible in the final image. Accumulative lens holds: each nightly lullaby thickens texture until the pattern breaks upward into living smiles. Orientation is swift; no causal gaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tunnel’s drip-rhythm and fissured ceiling are not backdrop but conduit; the leaf blower’s nozzle literally breaches the boundary, making setting an active agent. Sensory hierarchy favors sound and touch, mirroring Elias’s disembodied state. Micro-setting—the blower’s gleaming pull cord—charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore laughter—tightens through nightly iterations that visibly soften grief; the final shift is the family’s audible chuckle at dinner, a felt price paid by Elias’s continued solitude. Escalation is accretive, not causal, but pressure remains coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken love and regret emerges from concrete acts: wind-borne apologies, leaf anecdotes. No moralizing; the final image of Elias alone in echoing dark reweights earlier joy with irrevocable loss. Subtext resides in the off-key lullaby itself—discord as honesty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, each sentence tuned to Elias’s spectral timbre: “mournfully eager tug,” “soft churn of otherworldly winds.” Patterned elision (no dialogue) is taught early and paid off in the final hush. Perceptual signature remains consistent—sound over sight, memory over flesh.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet breathable; figurative language serves pressure without clutter. No loops or scaffold; every image advances atmosphere or stakes. Rhythm modulates from long elegiac lines to clipped beats at the cord-pull, mirroring effort.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade>
<comment>The leaf-blower symphony conductor is a fresh conceit fully inhabited; transformation test fails if swapped. Ghost-as-gardener-of-grief is non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
