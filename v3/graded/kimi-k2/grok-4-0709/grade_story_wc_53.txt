<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—clinging to the camera wheel while fearing its revelations—play out in embodied micro-choices (twisting the wheel to “wind the words”). The ghost’s accusation crystallizes her internal fracture, and her final pocketing of the wheel signals earned, costly resolve. One slip: the phrase “regret bloomed in her chest” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each collected fragment thickens the pattern until the carousel’s creak reweights the stakes. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara’s stance crystallizes with the felt cost of re-igniting ambitions. Orientation is taught early via the groaning carousel and mist; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon’s unnatural calm and the camera wheel’s etched grooves physically constrain Elara’s listening stance and final choice. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“clouds below parting like veils”). One minor drift: “shallow pools that danced with unseen currents” repeats the lagoon’s motion motif without fresh pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—renegotiating her eroded self—tightens as each fragment forecloses denial. The ghost’s demand escalates pressure; Elara’s counter-offer (“rebuild from the silt”) is a visible trade-off. Cost is legible in the ghost’s fading form and the carousel’s ominous creak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of eroded ambition emerges through concrete particulars: the camera wheel’s repurposed notches, the ghost’s accusatory ripple. Final image of Elara “whole in her broken sky” offers resonant, non-moralizing reweighting. No thematic echo or tidy moral intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in Elara’s scavenger perceptual signature (“boots sloshing,” “wheel clicked louder”). Patterned elision of time is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful (“voice thin as cloud thread”). One paraphrase loop—“ambitions erode” appears three times in close succession—dulls the edge slightly. Otherwise, rhythm and clarity serve pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: skyborne carousel as confessional engine, camera wheel as ear-trumpet for regret. The kinetic lagoon’s physics feel inevitable, not gimmicky. Risky time-folding pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
