<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alex’s interior contradiction—honest child of a con artist—drives every beat; the ink pot and asylum math crystallize a credible renunciation of deceit with visible cost. Embodied emotion (“burning need,” “heart pounding”) stays specific, never diagnostic. The final micro-choice—closing the casket—earns the Earned Stasis by foreclosing further cons. Minor slip: “mathematics of a fair trade” edges toward label-speak once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: each beat links because/therefore from discovery of ink → decoding algorithm → midnight breach → asylum granted. Closure lands on-page with felt cost: Alex liquefies their own rigid honesty to seal the forgery, then closes the casket—Earned Stasis with visible forfeiture. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. One tightening suffices and is cleanly executed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prep room’s embalming tools, refrigeration hum, and polished wood constrain Alex’s every move; the casket itself becomes the final charged object. Sensory hierarchy narrows to what a mortuary insider would notice under pressure. Micro-setting (ink pot, laptop, body) functions as setting extensions that alter tactics. No static cataloging; every detail is filtered through Alex’s urgent calculus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elena’s asylum—signaled early and escalates through Alex’s agency: decoding, waiting, breaching. One meaningful tightening at midnight narrows options to “upload or abandon.” Cost is legible: Alex sacrifices absolute honesty to balance Father’s debts. No coincidence resolves; the breach is earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of equitable redemption emerges from concrete acts—ink liquefying rigidity, math balancing risk—not from assertion. Final image of the closed casket reweights the premise: deceit redeemed only by further deceit, honesty intact yet compromised. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers. Subtext in the ink’s “subtle magic” reframes Father’s legacy without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Alex’s clinical yet haunted diction (“deathly vitality,” “cosmetic revival”) stays consistent under pressure. Syntax tightens during the breach, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly anchored. Dialogue absent, so voice judged solely on interior texture—clean, purposeful, character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and information-dense; every sentence advances plot or atmosphere. Figurative language is selective (“doubts melt like ice”) and never muddles causality. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Minor filter verbs (“felt,” “watched”) are voice-motivated and sparse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: con-artist redemption via algorithmic ethics and magical ink in a mortuary. Tropes transformed—ink as moral solvent, asylum forgery as fair trade. Specificity of funeral-home tools and bureaucratic math grounds the premise. Risk-taking (magic realism in gritty realism) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
