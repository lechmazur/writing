<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s ache for her brother and Tracker’s loyalty are embodied and consistent; the micro-choice to trace the cylinder grooves under lantern light crystallizes their shared stake. Interiority stays concrete, but the final step onto the cracked horizon is slightly under-motivated—no explicit cost or renunciation is dramatized, only implied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pair step into the bruised dawn, options reweighted by the riddle’s warning. Causal chain holds—leaf → riddle → cylinder → coordinates—yet the cost is felt more than shown; a hairline slip keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The scrapyard’s rusted metal and “wild hush” are vivid, selective, and filter through Tracker’s nose and Elara’s lyric eye. The overturned truck-cab den and lantern-lit cylinder act as micro-settings that constrain choice; one more tactile detail at the final step would have pushed 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find the brother or his fate—tightens when the cylinder yields ambiguous coordinates. Pressure escalates under Causal lens; the riddle’s warning about “half the sky” raises cost, yet the final beat leans on hope rather than a visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of translating distance into closeness emerges through the leaf, the riddle, and the step into unknown wastes. No moralizing; the final image of bruised dawn reweights earlier motifs with quiet resonance, though ambiguity is slightly safe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Tracker’s senses and Elara’s lyric register; no head-hop. Syntax modulates with pressure—“dust-choked afternoon,” “wild hush of stars”—creating a distinct perceptual signature that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language (“sunset bleeds like a wound”) is purposeful and patterned. One minor loop—“wild hush” repeated in close proximity—dulls momentum slightly; otherwise rhythm and propulsion are exemplary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Post-war scrapyard, retired bloodhound, waxed leaf, and phonograph cylinder synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. The tinted-revelation concept reconfigures familiar quest tropes without gimmickry; risk-taking heightens stakes while clarity holds.</comment>
