<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Witness’s motivation is stated but never tested; he moves through the library without interior contradiction or embodied cost. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values—only serene procession toward inevitable success. The “eternal vigil” backstory is summarized, not dramatized, so the final unification feels pre-ordained rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: illusions tear, unity revealed, cosmos exhales. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of mirrored spirals and lexicon loops reweights meaning. Yet the cost is abstract; no concrete forfeiture or constraint is legible on the page, capping the score below 8. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The temple library is evoked with starlight shelves and hushed acoustics that mirror the spiral motif. However, the setting never materially constrains choice; aisles bend obediently to the Witness’s purpose rather than limiting tactics. The dictionary alone functions as micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate partially.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unravel illusions to restore harmony—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via accumulative pattern (spiral aisles, glowing definitions) rather than causal tightening. The Witness faces no live trade-off or visible price; the cosmos simply yields, keeping escalation moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of unity-through-arbitration emerges organically from the dictionary’s meandering definitions and spiral architecture. Final image of veils tearing offers resonant, non-literal answer. Occasional abstract phrasing (“cosmic illusions,” “fractured unity”) edges toward label-speak but stops short of overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lush, archaic, and consistent; perceptual signature favors echoing sibilants and recursive syntax that enacts the spiral. Compression and elision are purposeful, taught early (“resounding hush…whispered without sound”). No head-hopping; POV remains locked to the Witness’s vast memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense, yet disciplined; figurative language rarely repeats without pattern payoff. Occasional elevated diction (“petrified starlight,” “hibernating heart”) flirts with purple but stays within voice. One paraphrase loop (“resounding hush” twice in two sentences) nicks the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cosmic librarian wielding a dictionary as arbiter of reality. Spiral arbitration as literal locomotion through aisles is inventive. Risk is high—cosmic stakes in 700 words—but coherence holds. Derivative echoes are minimal; the premise feels singular.</comment>
