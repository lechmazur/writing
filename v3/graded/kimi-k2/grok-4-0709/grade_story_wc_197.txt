<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“heart pounding,” “clutched the only relic”), but her contradictory impulses remain under-dramatized; the final reappearance feels earned yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the broadcast pierces indifference and Elara’s vanishing crystallizes risk. Causal chain holds—key → booth → lagoon mirror—though the puddle-map’s mechanics are lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>City rain, half-submerged booth, and auric lagoon are selective and atmospheric; the booth-as-node constrains the climax, but the lagoon’s “molten gold” edges toward ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve truth against erasure—tightens when drives are seized and the booth becomes last resort. One clear escalation beat: signal falter → lagoon reflection fix. Cost is legible but abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory vs. indifference emerges through action; the unrevised histories broadcast is a resonant non-moral answer. Final image of “freedom’s code endured” reweights prior motifs without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet urgent, with controlled rhythm under pressure. Occasional elevated phrasing (“tyranny of apathy”) slightly drifts from Elara’s grounded POV but remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; minor loops (“history,” “indifference” repeated) and one mixed metaphor (“molten gold beneath a canopy”) keep it from flawless. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar dystopia is refreshed by the obsolete phone-booth node and puddle-map navigation; synthesis feels inevitable. Risk in lyric compression pays off without obscuring causality.</comment>
