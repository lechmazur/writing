<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s temporal gift and pariah status are embodied through her tactile handling of the compass and the deliberate slowness of her sketching; the micro-choice to align the applique with the viewport crystallizes her shift from exile to explorer. Internal contradiction is light—more wistful than conflicted—so the arc feels inevitable rather than fiercely earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single continuous scene; causal chain (sketch → alignment → anomaly → resolve to search logs) is legible under a Causal lens. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the deck’s silence turns from oppressive to companion, cost paid in permanent solitude acknowledged in the final breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Derelict station and warped starfield are filtered through Elara’s time-sense; the compass rose’s glints become micro-setting that literally guides her final bodily orientation. Spatial choreography is clean; residual warp hum and contracting metal provide tactile anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—find meaning in exile—tightens when the anomaly redefines her isolation as opportunity. One visible cost: the irreversible solitude of the shutdown. Pressure escalates via her slowed perception, but external stakes remain largely internalized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of “true north” emerges through the compass heirloom and the nebula’s alignment; no explicit moralizing. Subtext resides in the silence that shifts from threat to invitation, reweighting exile as destiny.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s slowed sensorium; diction is precise yet lyrical (“elongated threads,” “stellar tomb”). No dialogue; interior monologue avoids filter verbs and maintains temporal texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; occasional poetic turns (“heartbeat from another era”) stay within POV’s perceptual range. One paraphrase loop around “echoed silence” is minor and motif-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar space-station ruin is refreshed by time-dilation as lived experience rather than backdrop; the heirloom compass as astral sextant feels specific to this lineage. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
