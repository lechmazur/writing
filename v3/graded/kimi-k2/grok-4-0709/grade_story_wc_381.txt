<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elias’s interior monologue aligns action with motive, yet occasionally leans into thematic label-speak ("tranquil blaze of determination"); the crane wing, brook, and origami are concretely embodied and influence micro-choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear: prophecy-driving ritual → mapped silence → hush. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis via the visible dissipation of voiced prophecy; lens holds as situational pressure cements renunciation rather than reversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Nighttime brook, stardust paper, liquid star-mirror are ply-specific and color choices; the micro-location under the oak where even crickets fall mute actively constrains ritual spread, charging the final hush.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prophecy’s muting—remains intact; escalation is a single, deliberate intensification rather than cascade, fulfilling situational lens demands. A visible cost is legible but not fully scaled to length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: hush as liberation and burden. Final image of brook as guardian of silence reconfigures the haven’s purpose sans explicit moral. No tidy resolution to internal solitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Quiet, measured rhythm aligns with summoner’s solitude; compression in ritual chant accelerates with urgency. Charged free-indirect style tracks perception degradation under stress, maintaining coherent voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Line-level ear favors melodic compression; few loops. Metaphors (liquid map, silenced wind) cohere without strain, keeping density purposeful and momentum steady toward final stillness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Original synthesis lies in mapping silence as tangible tool; ancient crane wing is particular yet swappable. Risk is modest, the hush-craft feels inevitable after setup.</comment>
