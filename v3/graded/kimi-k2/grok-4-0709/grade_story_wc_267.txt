<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s conflict between paralysis and the yearning to break silence is embodied throughout voice, gesture, and pacing. Interiority pulses in his regeneration tingles and the warm bolt in his pocket, turning guilt to tactile present. The micro-choice to stay—made at dawn with cost explicitly felt—renders contradiction at full scale.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>In Accumulative/Textural lens, the rusted bolt’s resonance builds patterned pressure that culminates in Charged Poise: Elias’s stance crystallizes as he decides to remain and bear the price of voice. Closure carries undeniable cost because bolt and silence are braided so tightly past and present collapse. No causality break; one transition serves narrative compression.</comment>

<comment>The snow-buried, cobalt-walled fortress is rendered through precise strokes: whispering snow at cracks, temperature seeping, spiral dust, and each stair as potential relic. Piano bench and bolt act as micro-setting pieces that physically constrain Mira’s ability and Elias’s choice—environment and object both lock choices and charge final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—the existential price of safety versus broken silence—escalates via Elias’s pattern of silent hauling and final crystallizing choice. Bolt discovery intensifies knowledge stakes, not just mood; escalation is textural yet decisive narrowing of options. Cost is legible when Elias fingers the missing bolt and vows to break his own quiet at real peril.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Theme of voice’s moral imperative emerges concretely through Elias’s embodied guilt and the bolt’s echo-threaded history. No authorial commentary; each echo makes silence itself the antagonist. Final image reframes safety as dangerous act of omission without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>The prose speaks with Elias’s restrained awe and tactile obsession; free indirect style is steady. “Phantom pains,” “snow sifted… like whispered secrets,” and “frozen-blue dusk” are character-filtered, never ornamental. Compression and lyric ellision stay legible under closure test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</question>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm varies: shorter pulses during discovery, elongation in snow silence. Almost no filter-verb drag and minimal repeated stems; “cobalt walls gleamed like frozen sapphires” and its return manage vividness without overwrite. Closure line is crystalline: “a spark against the cold” does double image work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</question>
<comment>The synthesis of mute choir guilt, bolt as time-thread, and fortress-as-safety-as-cage is fresh without gimmick. No borrowed plot beats; guilt over a communal silence is rarely dramatized through physical artifact. Quiet reversal—staying to relearn sound rather than flee—feels fresh and earned.</comment>
