<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias’s drive to expose lies is clear and embodied in every beat; his micro-choice to pocket the diamond crystallizes the cost of truth. Interiority is specific—his scoffing at curses, the racing heart—but the final beat leans on summary rather than a fully dramatized contradiction. Still, the flaw feels proportionate to the word count.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The causal chain (rumor → orchard → box → letters → revelation) is tight, and the closure reconfigures the world’s stakes by revealing the stillpoint’s science. The final image—“carrying the weight of truth”—is a Charged Poise that forecloses the comfort of myth. One minor ellipsis: the shredded letters are reassembled implausibly fast, but it doesn’t break the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orchard’s impossible stillness against radioactive storms is visceral, selective, and immediately constrains Elias’s tactics (safe air, edible fruit). The diamond’s glow and the shredded paper texture are micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—truth versus sustaining hope—tightens when Elias realizes the diamond can save or doom survivors. One clear reversal: from skeptic to reluctant bearer of salvation. The cost is felt in the final beat: he shoulders the burden of dismantling comforting lies.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the cruelty and necessity of truth in a dying world. The orchard’s fruit and the diamond’s “curse” reweight from myth to tool without sermonizing. Final image resonates without moralizing—Elias’s doubt is the lingering cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lean, and filtered through Elias’s skeptical lens (“curses were for the weak-minded”). Syntax tightens under pressure; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” risk) is avoided; the prose stays grounded.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and free of loops. One paraphrase loop (“radiation meters on his suit dipping to safe levels—an impossible oasis”) could be trimmed. Otherwise, high density and no figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The stillpoint-as-science-not-magic twist feels fresh yet inevitable. The post-Liquidation orchard and cursed-diamond rumor transform familiar tropes through Elias’s skeptical occupation. Specificity (shredded corporate letters) grounds the concept.</comment>
