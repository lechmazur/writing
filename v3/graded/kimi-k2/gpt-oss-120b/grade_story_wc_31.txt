<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli’s interiority leans poetic but stays specific to the quest for the “color of sound.” The contradiction between yearning for hidden knowledge while fearing its cost surfaces in his micro-choice to hide behind truth. However, embodied emotion slips into abstract lyricism at climax—“luminous vow fulfilled”—costing a fractional intensity hit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative pattern teaches the meteor-hush motif and key-tag logic early, culminating in the violet-amber ribbon that reconfigures meaning. The decisive change (teal chord now visible) lands on page with visible cost: the key becomes bound to a glowing sigil. Lens holds cleanly—every step deepens Eli’s understanding and forecloses return to ignorance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“Sea-glass windows that caught the lantern’s dim glow” and the salt-ink library anchor time, place, and mood with tactile precision. The sunken hull itself constrains entry and egress, while the teal hue lingering on fingertips re-charges setting into the final image. Slight word-count pressure allows no additional micro-setting details.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single dominant stake—discover the color of sound—is reiterated and escalated via the library’s color-beats and the binding of the sigil. The tightening occurs when Eli recognizes the visible chord; the cost is implicit but legible in the “next journey” map. No reversal beyond the chord, so escalation stays modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Theme of transmuting ineffable into visible is embedded in scenes and ending ribbon; no explicit thematic speechifying. The color of sound becomes both cipher and release without tidy moralizing. Ambiguity invites a reader’s sense of synesthesia but avoids deeper friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical free-indirect style sustained: the hush/ribbon synesthesia taught early and carried through to teal fingertip cadence. Pronoun and perceptual POV stay anchored inside Eli’s sensorium. Occasional register loft—“meteor hush,” “luminous vow”—is pattern-taught and legible at closure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Rich rhythmic variation propels; near-zero repetition or filler. “A current of light spilled out, forming a ribbon of violet and amber”—simultaneously image, action, synesthesia—in one efficient move. One mild paraphrase loop (“whispered a final luminous vow to the night” echoes earlier iterations) trims the ceiling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh fusion of librarian trope with bioluminescent undersea acoustics feels inevitable in hindsight. The color-of-sound conceit remains non-generic even against existing “chromophony” lit. The concept commits fully and reweights meaning rather than decoration.</comment>
