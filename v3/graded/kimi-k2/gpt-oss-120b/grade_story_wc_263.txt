<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dreamer's interiority is lyrical but generic; no contradictory impulses surface in scene. Motivation ("to free trapped creativity") is stated, not dramatized through micro-choices. The final renunciation—leaving the instrument—earns mild poignancy yet lacks prior causality showing why this cost matters to him personally.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the released creativity becomes a lingering auroral echo with felt conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of traced stars and rising chorus reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. However, the "unwritten calendar" mechanism is asserted rather than taught, blurring rule clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aurora-lit archway is vividly rendered and constrains action—cold stone, shifting light guide the tracing ritual. The astronomical instrument functions as micro-setting, its brass limbs anchoring spatial choreography. Sensory selection is purposeful, though scent of "hope" edges abstract. Final image of the archway as "testament" charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped creativity—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each traced star thickens the unheard chorus, tightening the dreamer's exhaustion. Cost is diffuse—fatigue rather than irreversible forfeiture—so pressure feels moderate. Agency resides in endurance, not decisive trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of creativity as cosmic memory emerges through accumulation of traced star-lines, not statement. Subtext whispers in "verses that never reached sunrise." Final auroral hush offers resonant reconfiguration: silence now carries poetry. Avoids moralizing, though abstraction occasionally drifts toward the generic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, consistent in lyric register. Perceptual signature—stardust as audible melody—is distinctive. No dialogue; internal monologue stays within POV lexicon. Occasional elevated diction ("shadowed rapture") fits the dreamer's heightened state. Patterned repetition of "unspoken" reinforces texture without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is sonorous, nearly overwrought, yet disciplined—each sentence advances image or stakes. Metaphors ("constellations that pulsed like quiet hearts") cohere. Minor loop: "rest" is both noun and verb in adjacent clauses. No clarity issues; rhythm modulates with fatigue and release. Final cadence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of astronomer-mystic and auroral gate feels fresh, avoiding stock fantasy. Tracing falling stars to free lost poems is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk resides in high lyric mode; payoff justifies it. Some phrasing edges familiar ("moonstruck dreamer"), but specificity of brass instrument and auroral echo rescues originality.</comment>
