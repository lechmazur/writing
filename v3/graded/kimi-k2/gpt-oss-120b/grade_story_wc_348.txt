<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete—foam patterns as polymer lattices, grief embodied in the empty chrysalis. Her micro-choices (kneeling, weaving reeds, recording bubbles) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final laughter and promise show earned change with visible cost. One slip: “loosened grief” edges toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the translucent bridge crystallizes the shift from separation to connection, cost legible in the chrysalis relic. Causal lens holds—each beat (failed experiment → ravine → foam insight → scaffold bridge) links by therefore. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 3rd sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Braided ravine, foam lattice, and reed scaffold are tactile, selective, and constrain every choice. The foam’s collapse teaches the polymer pattern; the ravine’s water flow literally shapes the bridge. Final glow reflects back onto the chrysalis, charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate separation into connection—tightens through each beat. Foam insight forces a narrowing of options: only the river’s lattice will work. Cost is visible in the emptied chrysalis and the spring pilgrimages she must now repeat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the foam’s lattice becoming a literal bridge; no moralizing. The empty chrysalis reweights from failure to conduit without explicit statement. Final image of child Lio handing her another shell offers quiet, non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is symphonic, tactile, and polymer-specific: “molecule seeking its partner,” “foam delineated a lattice.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—long lyrical lines under awe, clipped phrases during construction. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Mara.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “stone walls twisting like intertwined strands of DNA” does double duty. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Sentence variety accelerates during foam collapse, then steadies as bridge solidifies. Clean copy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fusion of polymer science with river foam as self-assembling lattice feels fresh and inevitable. The chrysalis motif transforms from failure to redemption without cliché. Risky detour from lab to ravine pays off in earned closure.</comment>
