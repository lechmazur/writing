<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s quiet resolve and resourcefulness are embodied in tactile micro-choices (salvaged lenses, shadow maps), but interior contradiction is only implied, not dramatized in-scene; the final endurance carries cost yet feels slightly predetermined rather than wrestled with.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the transmission rewrites public memory, a felt conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens; causality holds, though the “liquid memory” conceit is taught late and risks momentary disorientation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The auric lagoon, key, and transmitter form a micro-setting that constrains access and charges the final image; selective sensory detail (molten gold surface, starlit ripples) is vivid yet occasionally ornate, nudging toward overwriting in one or two lines.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—broadcast truth against indifference—tightens once when Mara commits to the key-turn; cost is the regime’s inevitable reprisal, sensed but not yet enacted, satisfying the single intensification rule under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of coded freedom emerges organically from action and image; the final whispered numbers reweight prior motifs without moralizing, though the “tyranny of indifference” phrase edges close to thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Lyric, textured voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature; purposeful compression (“liquid memory,” “phantom fireflies”) teaches its pattern early and pays off at closure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense; occasional stacked metaphors (“silver veil,” “molten gold,” “phantom fireflies”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum; zero loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar rebellion trope is refreshed through the puddle-reflection map and liquid-memory conceit; synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, and the risk of lyrical excess is balanced by clarity of closure.</comment>
