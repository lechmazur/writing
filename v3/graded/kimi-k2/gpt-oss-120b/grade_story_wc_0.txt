<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is textured and embodied—her “kindled humility” is shown through tactile micro-choices (brushing dust, aligning vial with light). The shift from cosmic ambition to garden-scale patience is credible, but the final renunciation is more stated than dramatized; the cost is felt but not sharply foregrounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse’s slow revival mirrors Mara’s stance crystallization, with the cost of relinquished grandeur legible in the final whisper. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each droplet and dust mote layers until the space “breathes.” No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The storm-scarred greenhouse is rendered with selective sensory density; cracked glass, golden ribbons of light, and exhaling walls constrain Mara’s observational tactics and charge the final image. Micro-setting (wooden table, vial, beams) functions as active participant rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can stripped-drama observation yield meaningful change?—tightens through accumulating humidity gradients and widening cracks; each beat reweights the cost of patience. Agency is observational rather than interventionist, but the narrowing options under the Accumulative lens are legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of humility-through-gradual-change emerges organically from decay-become-data; no moralizing, only the quiet reprise “We are all dust, rearranged.” The butterfly dust reweights from trivial to catalytic without overt statement, achieving conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and POV-consistent; scientific lexicon (“humidity gradients,” “neutron star”) is filtered through Mara’s humbled gaze. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure—longer cadences in reflection, clipped notes during logging. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional figurative layering (“wounded beast,” “garden ghosts”) skirts overwriting but never stalls momentum. One paraphrase loop (“decay… gradual change”) is minor. Strong information density—sentences often do two jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses astrophysics with butterfly-scale ecology in a non-obvious synthesis; the greenhouse as living lab feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking lies in the quiet accumulative arc rather than spectacle, and it pays off in the final reconfiguration.</comment>
