<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“tremor of certainty in her fingertips”), but the mapper’s contradictory impulses remain under-articulated; the final vow feels more declared than earned. Micro-choices (kneeling, pressing the punch) align with motive, yet no visible flaw complicates the ascent to stewardship. Cost is gestured at (“never cease the unraveling”) rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ledger reweights the premise from stone fortress to living archive, and the mapper’s new role as conduit carries conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—ticket punch unlocks door, ledger redefines mission—though the middle beats lean accumulative rather than strictly causal. Orientation is swift; no debt applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Starlit vault, ivy doorway, and amber cavern are rendered with selective sensory economy; the phantom ticket punch itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment subtly mirrors interior shift from external map to internal archive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—access to unspoken truths—signaled early and tightened once when the ledger redefines the fortress. Escalation is accumulative: each cracked arrow deepens pattern rather than narrows options. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; a more tangible forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of cartography as stewardship of silenced narratives emerges organically from concrete beats; no explicit moralizing. Final image of the mapper stepping back onto glowing arrows reweights earlier motifs without statement. Subtext operates in the ledger’s blank pages and the city’s approving shimmer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that accelerates down the staircase and breathes in the cavern. Perceptual signature is consistent: the mapper notices cracks, constellations, and ledger lines with cartographer’s bias. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“colossal eye… skeletal fingers”) risk overwriting yet serve atmospheric escalation. No loops or scaffold; sentence rhythm modulates with descent. One mixed metaphor—“vault’s ancient echo vibrate through her bones”—slightly muddies causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses urban fantasy with archival metaphysics in a fresh synthesis; phantom ticket punch as key feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Minor deduction for echo of familiar “hidden city” trope insufficiently transformed.</comment>
