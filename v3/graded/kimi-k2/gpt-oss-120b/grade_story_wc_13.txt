<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s desire to “find the place where echoes are born” is clear and embodied through her sketching and pendant use, but interior contradiction is muted; the final renunciation of the pendant feels more symbolic than personally costly, so the earned change lands softly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira releases the pendant and the city’s cadence steadies. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each ripple, glow, and echo layers density until the final image reweights time itself. Cost is felt in the dissolution of the pendant, though the price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rooftop canal lattice, the violet ribbon of borrowed time, and the singing cavern walls are vivid, selective, and directly constrain Mira’s path; the pendant and water together charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncaging suspended moments—tightens through escalating sensory pressure: chime, glow, spiral staircase, vortex. Each beat increases the cost of borrowing time until the final release; agency is high, though the price is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of time as sculptable medium emerges organically from Mira’s choices and the city’s heartbeat; the ending’s image of star-like points dissolving into silver water offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the quest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet anchored in Mira’s perceptual bias—light fractured on ripples, “tiny constellations,” “dreamscape stitched by sighs.” Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head-hopping or register drift. Distinct texture sustains throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“luminous ribbon,” “spiral staircase of light”). No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction fits the mythic register. One mixed metaphor—“loops climbing like vines”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The fusion of city-as-sleeping-giant, canals-as-veins-of-possibility, and illustrator-who-sketches-time feels fresh and inevitable. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure; no derivative echoes.</comment>
