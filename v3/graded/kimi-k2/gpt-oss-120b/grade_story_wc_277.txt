<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s motive is clear and consistent, but interiority drifts into abstract summary (“solemn playfulness,” “weight of responsibility”) rather than embodied contradiction. The pen-nib choice is motivated, yet the cost feels intellectual rather than visceral. No second character on page, so relationship crucible waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the ledger’s coordinates are exposed, the city’s “orbits of regret” begin to unwind, and the cost is the irrevocable public reckoning. Causal lens holds—each beat follows because/therefore logic. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory’s glass dome and humming telescope pipes are vivid and selective, filtering through Mira’s newsroom memory. The setting constrains the final action: only the console slot accepts the pen nib, making the environment instrumental to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover the hidden ledger—tightens when the console proves the ledger exists and pinpoints its location. One meaningful turn: the cipher unravels, foreclosing denial. Cost is societal exposure, felt through the distant siren and journalist’s arrival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus complacent headlines emerges organically from Mira’s proof-by-contradiction tactic and the ledger’s exposure. Final image of “fresh edition” sky offers resonant, non-moralizing answer. No overt thesis statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is textured, with rhythmic control (“ink once fell like rain on dead stories”) and perceptual signature rooted in print culture. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. POV remains stable; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional elevated diction (“crystallized final moment”) fits the lyric register. No loops or scaffold; metaphors cohere. One mixed metaphor—“floating thought, solemn yet playful”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: newsroom relic + astronomical observatory + proof logic = non-obvious frame. Risky lyric compression pays off in closure image. Premise is transformed through specific lived detail rather than template.</comment>
