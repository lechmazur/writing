<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s synesthetic hearing and designer identity are vivid, embodied, and drive every micro-choice; the interior contradiction between collecting absences and seeking reparation is dramatized in scene. The final renunciation—leaving the device among the roots—earns its cost through prior causal beats. Minor slip: “cells divide” reflection drifts toward summary rather than immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (coral shard, aurora sparks, kelp glass) tightens the pattern until the final chord reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the device’s amber-teal chord crystallizes options and cost without tidy resolution. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse, forge, and shipwrecks are not backdrop; the forge’s soot-gray fire and coral shard physically constrain Mara’s imprinting process and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is exact; kelp-laden glass and rusted masts track across beats. Environment meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find the sound of trust breaking”—is signaled early and deepens through each collected absence. One decisive intensification: the forge inhales the coral’s void, narrowing options to a single lullaby pattern. Cost is visible in the sparks that dissolve, marking each promise lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-forge emerges organically from action; no moralizing. Final chord of amber and teal offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior betrayals into new resonance. Subtext in the orchard’s “whisper of growth” complicates grief with hope without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—compressed, synesthetic, yet legible—mirrors Mara’s perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadence for wonder, clipped fragments during imprint. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data and stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“ashen forge inhaled the void”). Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” zone) but consistent with Mara’s designer intellect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—synesthetic hearing-aid designer forging broken trust from color-absences—is fresh, non-obvious, and fully committed. Synthesis of marine gothic, synesthesia, and memory-tech feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
