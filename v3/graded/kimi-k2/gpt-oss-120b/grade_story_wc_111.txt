<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vine dresser’s interiority is embodied and consistent—his “wisely pragmatic” trait shows in the tactile ritual of polishing cracked marbles. Internal contradiction surfaces in the “blooming withering” paradox, but the final choice (kneeling, placing the marble) feels slightly under-motivated; the garden’s voice resolves tension more than his own micro-choice. Still, the cost of humility is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden crowns him, reweighting the pact from deception to mutual recognition. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each polished marble adds density until the lattice of truth glimmers. One transition (alcove → oak root) is clean. Cost is visible in the “weight of both bloom and rot” settling on his skin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The maze breathes with selective sensory detail—vines “curling like whispered promises,” marble “cold edges like a reminder.” Setting constrains movement: every polished marble opens a new pathway, so the garden itself shapes tactics. Micro-setting (oak root as parchment) charges the final image. No orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prove the garden knows its gardener—is signaled early and tightened through escalating density: each shine → new path → garden’s hum matching the luck gauge. The final clearing opens as earned payoff, not coincidence. Cost is the paradoxical “blooming withering” he must carry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of mended deception emerges organically from the gardener’s tactile labor; no moralizing. The cracked marbles reweighted into “shining pathways” offer a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext hums in the garden’s mossy voice and the fountain whispering names—no explicit thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded in the gardener’s perceptual bias—“cold edges like a reminder,” “mottled like parchment.” Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences for ritual, clipped fragments when the ground trembles. No head-hopping; free indirect style stays clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language clusters in low-pressure beats and pays off. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“commemorating small victories elaborately”) fits the gardener’s ritual register. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The measurable-luck sky and sentient garden feel fresh yet inevitable. The cracked marbles as covenant tokens transform a familiar garden trope into a living negotiation. Risk in lyric accumulation is rewarded when the maze crowns the keeper—specific, irreversible, and earned.</comment>
