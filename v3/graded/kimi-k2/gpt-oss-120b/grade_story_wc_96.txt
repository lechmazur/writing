<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lira’s molting trait is asserted but never dramatized in a single beat; her choices feel generic “poet” rather than personality-specific. Rook’s scholar-calm is sketched but never tested under pressure. The final whispered line is earned but the interior contradiction that should precede it is missing on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—“We have rebuilt a garden in stone”—with conceptual cost (perpetual vigilance). Causality is Accumulative/Textural: each night’s rebuilding tightens the pattern. The Orientation Test is met by ~90 words. Minor drift: the “year” jump is asserted, not bridged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rusted library constrains every move—broken panes admit only slivers of light, shelves become literal bricks. Micro-setting of the coffee tin’s false bottom and seed cracks is tactile. Final lanterns of salvaged metal reweight the setting from ruin to beacon. Spatial choreography stays clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can beauty outlast anarchy?—is signaled early and deepens through each repaired shelf. Escalation is Accumulative: each sprout raises stakes of discovery. Cost is conceptual (perpetual exposure) rather than visceral, keeping it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: rebuilding as resistance, beauty as weapon. Subtext lives in the unspoken risk of tending flowers in stone. Final image reframes earlier rust as “veins of light” without moralizing. Slight over-articulation in “why they rebuilt” line costs 0.1.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyric compression is taught early—“whispered applause,” “trembling candle”—and sustained. POV stays tight to Lira’s shifting lens; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature: she measures time by moon-clearing skyline. Dialogue minimal but voice-driven: “What rebellion hides in a cup?”</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet musical; occasional stacked metaphors (“rusted iron into veins of light”) risk overwriting but pattern is taught. No loops or scaffold. Strong noun-verb choices—“shuffled,” “humming,” “fractured.” One filter-verb cluster (“she wore… like a coat”) is forgivable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of prison-library, monthly personality molting, and seed-bearing coffee tin feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are inverted: library as fortress, poetry as mortar. Specificity anchors universals; no derivative echoes. Risky lyric mode pays off in closure image.</comment>
