<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Interiority favors lyric evocation over embodied choice—motions trace the fog and rope but not contradictory impulse; motivation clear but never visibly taxed; final endurance is poetic rather than dramatized cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral constellation reweights the entire vigil as stewardship; causality sustained by Accumulative linkage of knot after knot; fog and aurora function only as texture—cost is felt but abstract, constraining no new tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory precision—salt-slick rope, kelp-lined chest—as micro-setting; fog and snowfall are atmospheric wallpaper; dock never blocks or enables a pivot, yet fulgurite glass constrains final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Stakes stay atmospheric—preserve “ancient methods” remains nebulous; no visible tightening until final spiral; no real trade-off or narrowing of options, only aesthetic deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of impermanence vs. memory emerges through knot decoding and storm-breath vial; no overt message—quiet ambiguity sustained; spiral constellation functions as resonant last image reweighting the whole.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyrical, elevated diction coheres with collector’s meditative stance; rhythm modulates with fog’s breathing cadence; no dialogue therefore no register clash; perceptual signature consistent throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is rich yet disciplined—rare loops; sentence-level propulsion sustained by tactile verbs; mixed metaphors minimal; no artifacts touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Merges maritime folklore, esoteric craft, and philosophical stewardship into fresh synthesis; knot-encoded lore and “lightning-kissed glass” create memorably peculiar pairing; relies on familiar poetic modes rather than formal risk.</comment>
