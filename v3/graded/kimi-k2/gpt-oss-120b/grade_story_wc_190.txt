<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; her motive to “teach silence” is stated repeatedly yet never tested by a concrete choice or contradiction. The only micro-choice—whispering counter-tones—remains gestural, so the Earned Stasis feels asserted rather than dramatized. No contradictory impulse or visible cost surfaces on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silver cascade reweights the premise, and the hush is felt. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of creak/whisper/silence tightens to final image. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. Cost is atmospheric rather than personal, slightly blunting impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prism terrace, storm glass, and river mist are vividly filtered through Lira’s perceptual bias; each sensory note serves the cadence shift toward silence. The terrace constrains movement and the vial’s color governs pacing, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—delivering calm—is signaled early and deepened by the vial’s amber-to-silver turn. Escalation is tonal, not causal: pressure rises via imagery rather than narrowed options. No visible price is exacted from Lira, so the tightening feels gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of silence-as-comfort emerges through pattern rather than statement; the final silver droplets reweight earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext resides in the hush itself. One soft “Listen” near the end skirts but does not cross into overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and perceptually specific—“fractured lullabies,” “vaulting hush.” Syntax modulates with emotional swell; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense yet propulsive; only occasional stacked modifiers (“fluidly logical mixture”) flirt with overwriting. No loops, no synonym churn. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; final paragraph lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of gondola, singing glass, and meteorological mood ring feels fresh; the conceit is pursued to quiet but resonant limits. No close echoes. Risk lies in near-abstraction, yet coherence holds.</comment>
