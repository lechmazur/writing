<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marlow’s stubborn resolve is embodied in his micro-choices—wading into flooded aisles, reassembling the lens, floating the last shard—each action carrying visible cost (soaked lungs, rusted hands, impossible perch). Interiority stays concrete: “each breath a reminder that he, too, was a carrier of silence.” The final renunciation—vanishing into the glow—earns its inevitability through prior causality. Flaw: no contradictory impulse in scene; stubbornness is monovalent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s pulse becomes a permanent address for the dead, cost paid by Marlow’s dissolution into light. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of light pulses and glowing tablets reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; water pressure and glass walls anchor by line 3. One transition (dock→library) is seamless. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drowned library is not backdrop; its water pressure, marble pedestals, and phosphorescent ink constrain every move. The broken lens reassembled into a “trembling eye” becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Marlow notices what resists or yields to his task. Spatial choreography is clean—boots echo, pedestal floats, lens shard placed three meters up.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grant the dead a permanent address—tightens once: the light pulses must succeed before the sea reclaims the lens. Escalation is accretive: each flash coaxes more tablets to glow, narrowing failure to zero. Cost is visible: Marlow’s silhouette merges with the beam, body forfeited. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Theme of rest versus restless memory emerges through image: the library’s “chased stillness” is earned, not declared. Subtext in the lens-as-eye suggests surveillance turned caretaking. Final image reweights the premise: the dead are housed, the undertaker is unhoused. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the “quiet pulse” that may outlast storms.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Voice is lyrical but disciplined: “patient sigh,” “phosphorescent ink that floated like ghosts.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under effort. Perceptual signature is consistent—Marlow notices resistance, decay, luminescence. No POV drift. Dialogue absent; none required. Rhythm modulates with pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Prose is dense yet clear: “the light rippled outward like a pulse” compresses motion and effect. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“vaulted dome,” “conceptual repricing”) fits the mythic register. One mixed metaphor—“trembling eye” may strain—but does not cloud closure. Clean grammar and tense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Premise—undertaker turns drowned library into lighthouse for the dead—is non-obvious and fully committed. Tropes (restless spirits, broken beacon) are transformed through tactile specificity: rusted cradle, marble pedestal, bioluminescent fish. Risky lyricism heightens stakes without gimmickry. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
