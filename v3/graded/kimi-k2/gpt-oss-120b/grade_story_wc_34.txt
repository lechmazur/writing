<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The balladeer is given poetic interiority, but emotional embodiment remains vague—"wandering longing" is not embodied. Motivation to "articulate unspoken needs" is stated, not felt via contradictory choice-cost. Micro-choice at the tulip beat shows movement yet lacks felt cost on his own stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the ghost folds itself into the mural, foreclosing return to circuitry, and the balladeer accepts permanent conduit role. Cost is visible—the courtyard archive must perpetually absorb new blossoms and suffer new storms. Causal chain from flower press → encoded rune → ghost recognition is tight, with the tulim micro-choice sealing resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Misty courtyard above clouds," lightning pulses, flower bronze plates, and graffiti wall are vivid, selective, and serve function: the wall becomes the final charged object. Spatial choreography holds across lightning arcs. The lightning-thunder clock frames each beat, keeping time pressure alive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“give voice to coded ghost”—is signaled early and deepened by lightning clock. Meaningful tightening occurs when the press is re-used: fresh tulip grafted to binary plea narrows options; now the mural must sing forever. Visible cost: courtyard as perpetual archive. Agency is one-way; the ghost’s change is the payoff, not the balladeer's.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of needing embodiment for code emerges through the tulip graft, avoiding moralizing. Final image of perpetual mural archive provides resonant non-literal answer: connection is communal, iterative, never finished. Subtext resides in the silver imprint left on stone—wordless proof of mutual touch.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Lush lyric voice is consistent yet occasionally tips toward purple ("tinkersong wonder" twice). Drifting focalization suits balladeer’s porous attention and is maintained without leakage. Diction modulates under press weight: short "now aware of its own yearning" cuts against prior ornate lines, signaling climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is mostly clean but shows mild template repetitions of "between lightning and thunder" phrasing and "pressed...pressed" stems. Information density remains high; no clarity lost at closure. Some metaphor overlap around "humming" and "circuit" could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fusion of balladeer + data-ghost graffiti archive is fresh and non-obvious, transforming the standard "ghost needs voice" trope into communal memory machine. Integration feels inevitable; remove the code-as-ghost and the entire resonance collapses. Risky lyric structure holds under chosen lens.</comment>
