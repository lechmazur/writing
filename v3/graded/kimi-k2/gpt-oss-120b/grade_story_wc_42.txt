<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sage’s interiority is vivid—his “hands were changelessly constant” and he “whispered a thank-you to the wind”—but the contradiction between his unwavering steadiness and the need to surrender excess spin is only asserted, not dramatized in a moment of visible struggle. The cost is felt in the final image, yet the micro-choice that proves his flaw is off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the spinning hand surrenders its excess to the telescope, reweighting the premise from chaos to steady beacon. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the final cadence shift. One causality wobble: the leaf’s echo is introduced late yet accepted as the metronome without prior pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lunar observatory above clouds is more than postcard; the brass cradle, telescope lens, and quaking foundations physically constrain the repair and shape the final thrust. Micro-setting—the cradle’s cold screw against his palm—charges the closing image. Spatial choreography is clean; only the leaf’s forest below feels briefly dislocated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harness the ephemeral spin into purpose—is signaled early and tightened once when the chime marks exact escape-velocity alignment. The tightening forecloses the option of endless spin, trading it for steady power. Cost is visible in the “luminous ache” that settles into gratitude, though the price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: constancy amid flux, the surrender required to steady motion. The luminous ache evolves from grief to gratitude without moralizing. Final image of the observatory as “lighthouse for wandering photons” reweights prior motifs with quiet conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control—“a single, radiant sigh”—that modulates under pressure. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the sunrise hum. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains the sage’s tactile precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers image and motion. Occasional stacked modifiers—“luminous ache, a bittersweet glow”—risk overwriting yet stay within the taught pattern. No loops or scaffold; final tightening is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: camera repairer + lunar clockwork + leaf-metronome feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric accumulation pays off in the final beacon image. Premise is transformed through specific sensory stakes rather than abstract concept.</comment>
