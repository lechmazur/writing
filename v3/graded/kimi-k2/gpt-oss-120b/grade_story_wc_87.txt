<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“merrily melancholic” paradox, “flickering faith”), but the navigator’s contradictory impulses are more summarized than dramatized in scene; the final alignment feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrestled for. Backstory is well-anchored to present choices via the compass wobble and pole-shadow navigation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sunrise dissolves sorrow and the compass steadies, reweighting regrets into “lessons rather than shackles.” Causal chain (abandonment → regret → compass wobble → pole-shadow course → sunrise acceptance) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is felt in the lingering memory of betrayal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Coastal launch, utility poles, and aging compass are rendered with tactile specificity; the poles’ shadows literally steer the kayak, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure (damp planks, sunrise gold, gull cries) and mirrors interior state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the navigator can convert regret into forward motion—is signaled early and tightened through the paddle-stroke mantra and sunrise dissolution. One meaningful cadence shift occurs when “backlash of regrets” is reframed as tide to ride; cost is the emotional labor of that reframing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of redemption-through-acceptance emerges organically from compass, poles, and sunrise; no explicit moralizing. Final image of “steady ember” reweights prior “flickering faith” without stating a thesis, achieving quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic variation matching paddle strokes and emotional swell. Perceptual signature is consistent: the navigator notices like a sailor (magnetic pull, pole angles). No dialogue, so no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and figurative but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“pen across paper,” “liquid glass”) risk overwriting yet stay legible. No loops or scaffold; momentum sustained. One mixed metaphor—“regrets dissolve into light”—is borderline but occurs in a reflective beat, not peak action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Familiar redemption arc is refreshed by the idiosyncratic navigation method (utility-pole shadows) and the aging astronomical compass as emotional lodestar. Specificity of coastal sunrise ritual lifts it above template.</comment>
