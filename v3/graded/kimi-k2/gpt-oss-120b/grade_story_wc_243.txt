<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archivist’s interiority is rich and embodied—his “gently thorough gait” and the locket’s cold hinge against skin—but the story never forces him to a costly choice; he merely records. The promise whispered to the night is affective, not a micro-choice that forecloses a path. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; the tension is atmospheric rather than internal. Thus the characterization is vivid yet static.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the ledger’s sigh and the locket’s moon-glow crystallize the covenant’s renewal with felt cost—the archivist’s lifelong vigil. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image layer steepens the stake until the final cadence shift. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. The only minor drag is the reflective block at ~30% word-count, but it tilts the present stance and is anchored by the locket cue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The blooming jetty is rendered with synesthetic precision—“violet and amber,” “crimson and white”—and the tide’s lapping physically constrains the archivist’s stance at the end. The locket functions as micro-setting, its glass catching starlight to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions. One notch below 9 only because the jetty’s flora never actively obstruct or enable a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving small memories via the covenant—is signaled early and deepened through the archivist’s writing ritual. Pressure tightens once: the turning tide physically encroaches, forcing the ledger shut and sealing the renewal. Cost is atmospheric rather than concrete; no tool, stamina, or social credit is visibly lost. Sufficient for the length, but the escalation is more cadence than obstacle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory’s fragility and the ethical duty to witness. The covenant’s regeneration reframes the child’s sepia smile as both anchor and burden, culminating in the starlit locket-moon. No moralizing; the final image invites multiple readings. The only minor slip is the phrase “preserve the weight of small moments,” which edges toward label-speak, though it is quickly embodied in ink and tide.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that swells under pressure—“the sea whispered back, a haunted euphoria.” Perceptual signature is consistent: the archivist’s synesthetic noticing steers every detail. No POV leakage or register drift. The lyric pattern is taught early and paid off in the final chant. A hairline slip in the repeated “haunted euphoria” refrain, but it reads intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, color, and motion without redundancy. Figurative language is selective—“ink dark as walnut bark”—and never muddles causality. No loops, no scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Minor over-modification in “ghostly echo beneath the crashing waves,” but it does not stall momentum or cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of maritime gothic and archival ritual feels fresh; the covenant’s conditional lighthouse beam is a non-obvious twist on keeper lore. Specificity anchors the fantastical—the walnut-ink, the jetty’s jasmine vines—preventing generic drift. The risk of lyric excess is balanced by disciplined cadence. Not quite 9 because the core conceit could survive relocation with minor edits.</comment>
