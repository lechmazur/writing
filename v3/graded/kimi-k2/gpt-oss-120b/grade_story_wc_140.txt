<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied; the “nameless identity” is a lived void that drives the choice to become “living archive.” The contradiction between erasure and custodianship is dramatized when the label’s glow forces the micro-choice to pocket it and keep gathering. Cost is felt: the act of collecting ghosts cements perpetual exile. Flaw—no secondary character on page—limits relational crucible but does not harm single-POV design.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—fragments accrue until the tidal projection reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise: “I would remain the unnamed keeper” crystallizes the stance and its cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by the rusted-forklift box within 120 words. No causality breaks; the label’s numbers indexing timestamps is the decisive pattern break that tightens the weave.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Port containers, tide, and poison label are selective, sensory, and constraining: the label literally filters perception, the swaying containers rewrite corridors, the tide times the reveal. Micro-setting (corrugated steel under fingertips) functions as lived body. Final image—label in pocket—charges the closing stance. No orientation debt; spatial choreography tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: recover erased histories before they vanish forever. Escalation is textural—each collected fragment increases the density of ghosts until the tidal projection forces the keeper’s stance. Cost is the irreversible commitment to endless gathering. One meaningful tightening suffices; no external reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the act of salvage: memory’s texture versus bureaucratic erasure. Subtext resides in the label’s sepia glow—poison repurposed as lens. Final image reframes earlier motifs without moralizing. Complexity is preserved: the keeper’s triumph is also perpetual exile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent; patterned elision (“My name is unimportant”) is taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature is tactile and maritime—rust, brine, corrugated cold. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Rhythm modulates with tidal cadence; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful and patterned (“rusted bones,” “museum of vanished moments”). No loops or scaffold; each sentence layers texture or advances beat. Minor elevated diction (“palimpsest”) is earned by voice. Closure line is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Premise—ghost archivist of erased port histories—is fresh and grounded in sensory specificity. Tropes of urban scavenger and found object are transformed through the poison-label lens. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk (lyric accumulative mode) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
