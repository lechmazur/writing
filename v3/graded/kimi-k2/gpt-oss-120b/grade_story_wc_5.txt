<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“her fingers moving like glacier ice”), but the alchemist’s contradictory impulses remain largely off-stage; the covenant is declared rather than dramatized. Micro-choices (spiral placement, palm to plate) are present yet feel ritualized rather than pressured. The Earned Stasis lands, but the cost is more asserted than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard’s “moving stillness” crystallizes the covenant, and the cost—seasonal return to tend the seal—is legible. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density increases until the final tableau. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. One tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Subarctic orchard, frost-kissed roots, and copper plate are tactile and selective; the orchard’s inhale/exhale constrains the alchemist’s promise. Micro-setting (plate as compass) charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and light over exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate heartbeats into luminous maps—is signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each spiral placement tightens the pattern until the starlight binds debris. Cost is visible in the vow of perpetual tending. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal and environmental.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of patience as covenant emerges through pattern-making and seasonal return; no moralizing. Final tableau reweights the orchard from dead to reverent sentinel. Subtext in “moving stillness” and “heartbeat maps” resonates without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Lyric, controlled voice sustains a sub-zero hush; diction (“safekept,” “flash-paper sunrise”) is distinctive and consistent. Rhythm modulates with the ritual’s cadence. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Perceptual signature is alchemist-specific throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Sentence variety supports the ritual pacing. Occasional elevated diction (“cartography of love and loss”) is earned by voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: starlight cartography via discarded debris in a frozen orchard. Premise commits fully; no retreat to generic fantasy. Risky lyric mode pays off in the final tableau. Transformation test passes—setting and method are inseparable from arc.</comment>
