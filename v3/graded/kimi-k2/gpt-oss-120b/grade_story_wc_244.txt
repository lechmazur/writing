<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira emerges distinct—jocular amid ruin, driven by a loneliness-cure ambition that redefines empathy into logistics. Interiority flickers (“desperately jocular”) then flattens to slogan (“polite anarchy”), but her final micro-choice—trusting the next keeper with the lantern—earns Charged Poise, carrying a felt cost in the gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Closure is earned: sending the lantern forward crystallizes a Repricing moment where reciprocity shifts from rumor to living practice. The arc follows a coherent Accumulative lens; each cut ivy strand intensifies the comet imprint’s promise until Lira’s hand-off makes the station a relay in a network of care, all under one continuous scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The station is rich—“ivy draped the old ticket booth like a green curtain”—and the comet-imprint stone serves as a micro-setting anchor that constrains the ivy-shaped puzzle and charges the final chime. Geographical coherence is maintained; spatial moves from platform to ticket booth to cavity feel tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: “cure for loneliness.” Escalation is a single, deepening arc of cuts revealing the stone and the communal chime, each slice tightening the task and charging the final reciprocity ripple. Pressure coheres; no reversals or coincidences dilute the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the reciprocity engine—every laugh returned becomes a bridge. The moon rock’s pulsing warmth and the lantern’s onward journey reweight the cure from substance to network without moralizing, achieving a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<comment>Voice is textured and playful—“rusty-hinge laugh,” “invisible-ink contract”—staying within Lira’s idiom while modulating under pressure. No head-hopping; compression in garden-shear cadence teaches the pattern and is legible at closure.</question>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Rhythm breathes: long sentences for creeping ivy, clipped ones for cuts. Minor loops—“she gathered…she hacked…she lifted”—are noticeable but never stall the final chime, keeping density high and artifacts contained.</question>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The premise—turning a moon shard into an emotional router—feels fresh because specificity grounds it: ivy puzzle, comet imprint, lantern dispatch. The quiet risk of reciprocity without spectacle keeps the ingenuity modest yet undeniable.</question>
