<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s defiance and mischief are vivid, but her interior contradiction—between the price she owes and her playful method—never crystallizes into a single, embodied choice. The “piece of herself” she offers remains metaphorical; no tangible loss is dramatized. Lio is present but exerts no pressure; thus relationship-as-crucible is absent. The final beat is a soft collective catharsis rather than a personal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the canyon’s “quiet hymn” signals forgiveness earned, and the cost is conceptual—shared memory and humility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of refracted verses increases density until the final image reweights meaning. Orientation is clear by line 3. The causal chain is loose but coherent under lyric accumulation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bone towers and pale spire are rendered with tactile specificity; their acoustic properties actively shape the poetry sessions. The setting constrains action—echoes return transformed—and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Weather and light evolve with the ritual’s cadence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“forgiveness has a price”—is signaled early and tightened through each refracted echo. The deepening is the townsfolk’s growing participation; the cost is the collective humility paid in shared memory. Agency is diffuse; Mara’s personal price is under-dramatized, preventing higher band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: art as communal atonement. The refrain “We are the echo” reweights prior refracted truths without moralizing. Subtext operates in the hush itself—silence hammered into breath. The ending invites reflection on memory’s cost without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and textured: “wounded beast,” “frozen finger,” “shards of secret confession.” Perceptual signature is Mara’s—selective, synesthetic. Syntax modulates with ritual intensity. No head-hopping; POV modesty intact. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet musical; figurative language is purposeful and patterned. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Rhythm accelerates with each echo return. Occasional elevated diction (“refract a single truth”) fits the mythic register. One mixed metaphor—“price settle like dust on her shoulders”—is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The fusion of bone-canyon acoustics with communal poetry feels fresh; the forgiveness-as-debt concept is given a non-obvious ritual form. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in the final reconfiguration. No close echoes of famous scenes. Transformation test: story collapses if canyon bones do not echo.</comment>
