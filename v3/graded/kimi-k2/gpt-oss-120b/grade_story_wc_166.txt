<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her exile is embodied in the “tinged pale light” after each fold-through—yet the cosmic-verse ambition remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized mid-scene, so the final smile feels slightly unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tide-garden pulse layers density until the inked constellation reconfigures exile into bridge; closure is a Charged Poise where the moonstone dust drifts outward, cost legible in the “gentle pull” now exerted on others.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Twilight garden is sensuously anchored—“salt and memory” arches, “moonlight like spilled ink”—and the night-bloom’s silvering at the end constrains the final gesture, but spatial choreography is lightly sketched; still, micro-setting (her skin, the pool) functions as charged environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crafting the unfading verse—tightens when the moonstone speck melts into glowing ink; the act forecloses pure solitude, yet the cost (exile transmuted into universal conduit) is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of chosen exile as generative gap emerges through image, not statement; the final dust-bloom silently reweights nostalgia from ban to invitation, avoiding moralizing. Subtext in the “whispered promise” of the speck lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically consistent, with tidal cadences and synesthetic perception (“obsidian grace,” “constellations whisper”); no POV drift. Compression and elision are taught early—slipping through “invisible cracks”—and paid off in the final fold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language rarely loops, and each image advances atmosphere or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“celestial rhyme”) risks register drift but remains within Lira’s mythic register. No line-level artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: tide-dancer as cosmic tattooist transforms familiar exile trope into luminous ritual. The moonstone-speck-to-constellation device is specific and inevitable in hindsight; risk lies in the quiet lyric mode, but coherence never falters.</comment>
