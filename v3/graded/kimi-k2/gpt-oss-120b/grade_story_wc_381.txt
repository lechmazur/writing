<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Solid interiority—the summoner’s tactile handling of the crane wing and the hush-chant embody her motive—but no contradictory impulses surface mid-scene; desire is monolithic. Micro-choices (align wing to water, exhale silence) are character-true yet not stressed by palpable error or flaw. Earned Stasis closure shows cost (crane now secret beacon), satisfying causality if thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Chosen lens is Accumulative/Textural: image sequences (wing pulses, lattice’s star-web) accrue density until the final charged poise. Motivated ellipsis aligns wing tip “as if pointing toward destiny,” a taught pattern that reconfigures sky-to-earth axis at closure. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: world folds into tranquil blaze, yet cost (prophecy sealed, personal burden retained) is visible in last glance at wing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Pine and rain scents, lantern glare on brook, stone alignment—each detail filters through the summoner’s ritual lens; quiet mirror-choreography of water constrains the silence-mapping and final lattice placement. Micro-setting (stone, wing, water interface) directly enables the stasis ritual. Sensory hierarchy is apt: ritual focus narrows perception, no tourism overflow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—prevent cosmic rupture—signaled early; pressure escalates through textual accumulation: each pulse of the wing tightens the hush-lattice, foreclosing the prophecy without external luck. One decisive deepening: brook’s slowing to mirror stillness marks threshold crossing. Cost is felt by summoner’s chest-warmth (earned stasis), though the cosmic rupture itself remains unseen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of gentleness as world-binding quiet emerges from specific ritual mechanics and lacquer-bright wing; no authorial summarizing. Charged poise in final image (wing ascends, golden light becomes hidden beacon) unites idea and emotion subtly. Yet theme never complicates—prophecy stakes feel blunt—so resonance stays poignant rather than thorny.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric pulse—soft sibilants, dusky phrasing (“molten glass,” “smoothed hush”)—mirrors summoner’s mystical cadence. POV remains unwavering, intimate distance, no filter verbiage. Purposeful repetition (“hush,” “blaze,” “wing”) functions as mantra, taught and paid off at closure through final flare into mist.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lyrical density keeps high information rate: “paper feathers fluttering without wind” does image-work plus ritual-accuracy. Occasional surplus detail (“distant rain,” “monks of the far east”) edges toward ornament but never stalls propulsion. Cadence yields to stillness at closure without figurative tangle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Oracular quietness delivered through origami-cosmic fusion feels fresh; premise elevated past typical mage-saving-world template by treating silence as active map. Yet star-to-earth veil threat remains generic—no felt societal fallout—so transformation stays interior and risk partial.</comment>
