<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is textured and embodied, but the “fortified vulnerability” is asserted more than dramatized; her micro-choices (tracing the pipe, turning the valve) align with motive yet lack a contradictory impulse that would sharpen the cost. The mentor memory is brief and cues present action, satisfying BRR, but the emotional contradiction remains underplayed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the valve turn redirects water and visibly loosens the city’s neglect, a Decisive Change with felt cost. Causal chain (humidity spike → lantern flicker → hidden pipe → valve) holds under a Causal lens. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lantern’s amber aura and the seeping concrete are vivid, selective, and filter through Mara’s investigative gaze; the tunnel’s damp breath constrains her path and tools. Micro-setting (rust-flaked valve, etched symbols) charges the final image. No white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preventable deaths from seepage—tightens when the hidden conduit is traced and the valve turned, foreclosing further flooding. Escalation is single but sufficient; cost is the city’s control loosening and Mara’s own emotional reckoning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of resistance against systemic neglect emerges through concrete action and the lantern’s inherited resolve; no explicit moralizing. The final image of “tiny stars” reweights prior symbols without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is controlled, rhythmic, and filtered through Mara’s precise sensory priorities; no POV leakage. Diction remains within her lexicon; “fortified vulnerability” is the only slightly abstract note.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean and propulsive; occasional lyrical layering (“droplets clung like memories entangled”) is purposeful and does not clog momentum. No loops or scaffold; grammar clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fusion of underground-railroad lantern with modern infrastructure audit feels fresh; the inherited object redefines utility rather than serving as mere symbol. Specificity of etched symbols and humidity pattern avoids generic tropes.</comment>
