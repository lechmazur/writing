<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Translator’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“shrewdly innocent gleam,” “lotus-hearted ache”), but the child remains a cipher; no contradictory impulses surface in the translator under pressure, and the final “graft” is asserted rather than dramatized as a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the coral’s droplet seals the new meaning, reweighting the child’s trauma. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each deciphered phrase layers density until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Marble columns, violet twilight, and clinging mist are selective and purposeful, filtering through the translator’s war-zone vigilance. The brain-coral vial functions as micro-setting, constraining the final action (droplet placement). Spatial choreography is clean; no static repetition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turning testimony into living tissue—signals early. Pressure tightens via each deciphered confession, narrowing options toward the coral graft. Cost is felt (lotus-hearted ache) but not yet visible on the child; escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of healing-through-witness emerges from concrete particulars (ink on plaster, coral lattice) rather than statement. Final image reframes prior trauma as “quiet strength” without moralizing. Subtext operates in the coral’s silent counsel and the mist’s collective sighs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to translator’s perceptual signature; diction (“unknotting the fear-laden knots”) is character-specific. No head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with anesthetic ebb/flow. Dialogue is absent, so no voice leakage there.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet precise; figurative language is sparse enough to avoid muddle. One paraphrase loop (“shared anxieties… shared anxieties”) is minor. Sentence rhythm mirrors the translator’s careful attention; no scaffold or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: war-zone translator + brain-coral graft as living testimony archive. Coral-as-healer trope is transformed through the child’s plaster cast interface. Specificity of “ink on splint” grounds the concept; no close echoes detected.</comment>
