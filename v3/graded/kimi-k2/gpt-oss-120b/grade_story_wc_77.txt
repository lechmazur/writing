<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied, but her contradictory impulses are stated rather than dramatized in scene; the final choice to swallow the clasp and utter “vanish” feels driven by symbolic logic rather than earned character cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of luminance, cursed rose, and paradoxical notes tightens toward a Charged Poise at the end. Closure is legible, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The funhouse is rendered with tactile specificity—broken mirrors, viscous air, ink-spray floor—and the carousel horse constrains the final act, charging the closure image with its cursed gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“trick fear into revealing its weakness”—is signaled early and tightened once when Mara places the clasp. The escalation is driven by symbolic pattern rather than character agency, limiting the felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of fear consuming itself emerges through image and paradox, not statement; the final reconfiguration of luminance into screaming silhouettes offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lush, gothic, and consistent; sensory diction (“sour scent that clung like syrup”) reflects POV bias. No head-hopping; compression and elision are purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, but occasional stacked metaphors (“repulsive allure of sweet rot”) risk overwriting; no loops or scaffold, and momentum holds to the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Transforms carnival-horror tropes through paradoxical dream logic and photographic decay; the synthesis feels specific to this voice, though the premise edges close to familiar gothic templates.</comment>
