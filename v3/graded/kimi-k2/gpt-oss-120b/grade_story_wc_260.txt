<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—self-respect vs. compassion—drives every micro-choice; the embodied tremor of her “fragile convictions” anchors the scene. The chameleon’s pulse of light and the tail-tip reattachment crystallize her earned change with visible cost. No stock phrasing; her voice stays tactile and specific. Minor slip: “balance is not a static point but a river” edges toward label-speak, blunting the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each discarded fragment layers density until the mist absorbs the architecture of deceit, reweighting trust. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the merged tail-tip and shared breath—felt cost legible in the hush. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. One tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The misty workshop under stars is no backdrop; its shimmering stillness absorbs the fragments and mirrors Mara’s shifting interior, constraining her ritual of shedding. Micro-setting (warm stone, crystal vial) functions as tactile tools that alter tactics. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Meets 9+ gate: environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconstructing trust after betrayal—tightens once: each layer shed narrows options until only honest return of the tail-tip remains. Pressure grows via Accumulative density, not causal turns; cost is the exposure of Mara’s complicity. No coincidence resolves; agency is hers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of reconstruction through honest shedding emerges from concrete ritual, never asserted. Final tableau—chameleon colors shifting with Mara’s breath—offers resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the scars. One near-slip: “balance is not a static point” flirts with summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture: hushed cadence, silver mist, “quietly vivid tapestry” all filter through Mara’s precise, tactile perception. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Syntax mirrors breath and pulse. Dialogue absent by design; voice remains coherent and singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, high-density; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“balance...a river that must be tended, stone by stone”—slightly muddies the final line, keeping it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Familiar betrayal-reconciliation arc is transformed through the chameleon’s literal re-membering and the mist as active witness. Specificity of wildlife-handler ritual feels fresh. Slight risk in lyric stillness pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
