<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The Keeper’s motivation—to preserve the echo of wisdom—remains abstract; no interior contradiction or embodied cost is dramatized. His single on-page action (consecrating the space) is performed with calm certainty rather than under pressure, so no visible trade-off or flaw complicates it. The villagers’ questions merely echo the theme rather than test him. Earned change is asserted, not shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet Charged Poise: the Keeper steps into the night “ready to consecrate each new clearing,” reconfiguring his future path. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of image and cadence shift carry the cost. Yet the causality between the prophet’s words and the Keeper’s resolve is implied, not dramatized, and the Orientation Test is met early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pavilion, dunes, and kinetic parapet are vividly sketched and filtered through the Keeper’s peripheral awareness. The shifting sand and humming pillars constrain his ritual and echo the theme of listening. Specificity is selective and purposeful; the final star-pattern image recharges earlier motifs. No world-rule inconsistency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“preserve the echo of wisdom”—is declared but never tested by an opposing force or a narrowing choice. Pressure remains atmospheric; no beat forces the Keeper to risk or forfeit anything. The conjured clearing appears as gift, not earned reversal. Cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of attentive listening and transmission of wisdom emerges through image and ritual rather than statement. Subtext is present in the half-mask and peripheral awareness, yet the prophet’s words remain generic, blurring specificity. Final star-pattern offers resonant non-literal answer, but lacks prior concrete tether to heighten reweighting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and textured; diction (“murmuring pavilion,” “whisperfield calm”) sustains a hushed, ceremonial cadence. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and held. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing”) momentarily drifts from the Keeper’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is fluid and read-aloud rhythmic; sentences vary in length and structure. Information density is high—each line advances atmosphere or theme. A few soft phrases (“strangely honest,” “ancient lullaby”) edge toward abstraction, but no loops or mixed metaphors mar clarity. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The desert-pavilion-prophet frame is familiar, yet the kinetic parapet and peripheral-awareness ritual give fresh inflection. Transformation is modest: the story could swap deserts and prophets with minor edits. Specificity of sensory ritual and half-masked conduit lifts it above template, but risk-taking remains cautious.</comment>
