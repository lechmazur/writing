<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s ethical diligence is embodied in tactile micro-choices—aligning the rake handle, whispering to the tide—yet the interior contradiction between her desire for absolution and the endless task is only asserted, not dramatized in scene. The final promise feels earned but lacks a visible cost that would deepen the flaw/compulsion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the pendulum’s resumed swing is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the “shared balance” premise with felt cost—she must return forever. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each inscription accumulates until the pattern crystallizes in the glowing veins of light.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge, bronze tower, and salt-etched rake handle are vividly selective; the molten rose flare at the end charges the final image, making the setting an active constraint that shapes the ritual. Spatial choreography is coherent; the tower’s spiral, cradle, and horizon track cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“restore shared balance”—is signaled early and tightens through the pause; the pendulum’s halt is the single meaningful intensification. Cost is visible (endless labor) but abstract; a more visceral forfeiture would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the iterative ritual rather than statement: incremental repair as fragile covenant with time. The final sunrise scattering like “shards of glass” offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature filters every detail through Mara’s salt-stung diligence. Rhythm modulates with the pendulum’s swing, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, but occasional stacked metaphors (“ink-licked stone,” “molten rose hue,” “veins of light”) verge on overwriting in the climactic beat. No loops or scaffold; grammar clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of clockwork cosmology and tidal ritual feels fresh; the rake handle as conduit transforms a mundane tool into sacred stylus. Specificity anchors the mythic without drifting into generic fantasy.</comment>
