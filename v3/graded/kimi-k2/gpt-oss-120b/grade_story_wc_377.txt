<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tuner registers as a single POV figure sustained through embodied motion; motivation is clear, interiority is concrete (“he smiles, feeling the muted vigor”). The arc is quiet renunciation—choosing silence over speech—but the interior contradiction and visible cost remain subdued, keeping it from the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the final image of the sculpture still moving under the star’s long shadow reweights meaning at sunset. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each glisten accumulates toward preserving wonder. Orientation anchors by sentence three; lens holds without leakage.</comment>

<comment>Whispering bluff, copper arm, and iceberg fragment serve as active micro-setting that constrains choice: the copper flexes to wind pressure, the ice responds to sunrise, the cliff records “shiver of stone.” Every sensory choice folds into action or stakes.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the color of wonder—is signaled early. Escalation is tonal accumulation: wind quiets, gulls grow silent, shadows lengthen, the final beat sustains the sculpture’s slow heartbeat. Feels like tightening, though a sharper cost would push higher.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from specificity: motion-made-music as silent truth. Subtext rests in shared silent watching, final sunrise glisten as non-literal answer. Resists statement, ends in image not moral. Slightly overt phrase “symphonies of truth” trims polish.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Diction is sonorous and purposeful—“whispering bluff,” “muted vigor”—maintaining lyric cohesion. Vocabulary never leaves the tuner’s internal lexicon. No dialogue, no head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent and compressed.</comment>

<comment>Prose is fluid, dense with image, almost no filler. Some near-repeats of “glisten” and “silent,” yet each recurrence carries new valence. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure; final paragraph crests without overwriting. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: kinetic sculpture made from rescued ice as silent bell. Quiet eco-lyric feels new rather than trope; concept held whole to end. No direct literary echoes. Risk is understatement, but it pays off in earned tone.</comment>
