<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“confidently uncertain” paradox), but the pen’s agency overshadows the interpreter’s micro-choices; final renunciation is earned yet lightly costed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the anomaly settles, history edited, cost felt in the “strange comfort.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds; one transition from chaos to order suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly and exotic nib function as micro-setting that constrains tactics; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, charging the final image without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeeming the failed experiment—tightens once via the pen’s rewrite; cost is visible in the lingering anomaly echo. Agency drives the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of revision versus erasure emerges organically from the editing conceit; final image of “quiet rebellion” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained; perceptual signature filters cosmic data through intimate body. No dialogue, so voice coherence is high; patterned elision taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“orchard of data,” “garden pruning itself”) flirt with overwriting but serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffolds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics and archival poetics; editing history via gravity-warped ink feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
