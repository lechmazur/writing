<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bellhop’s silent endurance and the guests’ shared apprehension are embodied through micro-gestures (lifting the bolt, watching the discoloration shift), but interior contradiction is muted; the final nod is credible yet the cost feels collective rather than personal, keeping the arc just shy of full individuation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the copper flare on the step crystallizes the price of safety in silence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each image layers density until the final gleam reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cobalt walls, frost-lined tiles, and the piano bolt’s iron gleam are selective, tactile, and mirrored in the characters’ cold vigil. The bolt’s final pulse on the step constrains the choice to accept silence, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“understand the cost of safety”—tightens once when the discoloration answers with copper warmth. Agency is collective endurance rather than individual decision, but the price is legible and the lens-consistent escalation suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: safety purchased by silence is both shield and prison. The final image of the bolt glinting against deepening copper reconfigures the motif without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with a perceptual signature attuned to frost, hush, and bruised light. Patterned elision (“seraphically mundane”) is taught early and paid off in the bellhop’s final nod. No head-hopping; rhythm modulates with the scene’s slow pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is selective (“bruised sapphire,” “frostbitten hope”) and never clutters the closure beat. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Minor register elevation is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The fusion of silent caretaker, regenerative experiment, and piano-bolt beacon feels fresh; familiar tropes of icy sanctuary are reweighted through sensory specificity and collective rather than heroic stakes. The bolt’s humble origin as bench hardware transformed into covenant object is an earned inflection.</comment>
