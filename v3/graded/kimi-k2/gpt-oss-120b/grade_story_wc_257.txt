<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“fingers stained with copper and grief”), but the shift from despair to hope leans on abstract epiphanies (“she understood…”) rather than dramatized contradiction. The final smile feels slightly unearned because the cost of reopening to life is asserted more than shown.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each origami crane layers density until the final crane reconfigures the observatory’s purpose. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the lenses now catch “inner glow”—with conceptual cost (perpetual stewardship of others’ grief). Orientation is clear by line 3; no causal leaps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The observatory’s brass lenses, ancient furnace, and weeping moon are selective, tactile, and thematically charged; the balcony rose constrains the final gesture. Micro-setting (rose stem as canvas) functions as setting-object that shapes the closing act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether grief can be alchemized into guidance—tightens through each crane’s deployment; the silver thread literalizes narrowing options. Cost is felt in the perpetual duty she accepts, though the price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of “lifting veils of intention” emerges organically from the stencil, cranes, and rose revival. Final image reframes mourning as renewable stewardship without moralizing. Subtle, earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with controlled psychic distance and rhythmic variation. “Genuinely artificial” as oxymoron threads through perception without drifting into purple register. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“rock-laden abyss that had stripped her of sparkle”) flirt with overwriting yet serve the accumulative design. No loops or filter-verb clusters; final image is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Familiar grief-to-renewal arc is refreshed by the observatory-cum-orrery of intention and the origami cartography. Specificity of “mourning jewelry maker” and copper-stained fingers grounds the concept. Risky lyric compression pays off.</comment>
