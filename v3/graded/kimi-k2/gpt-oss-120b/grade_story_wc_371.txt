<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied (“he felt the tenuous absolution that came from holding something both lost and present”), but the character’s choices remain largely observational; the final offering to the empty chair is a micro-choice rather than a decisive turn, so the earned cost feels mild.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the loaf’s reduction to crumbs crystallizes the theme of fragile endurance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of remembered scents and textures tightens to the final image. Cost is felt in the quiet relinquishing of the bread, though the causal chain is more lyrical than driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective (“vines draped the low roof and the scent of jasmine mingled with steaming oolong”). The tea-house micro-setting constrains the final meditation and recharges the loaf’s memory, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial anchors are clear early; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescuing the sacred from the ordinary—is signaled early and deepens through sensory accumulation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the loaf is sliced and shared; the cost is the irreversible reduction to crumbs. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, though escalation is gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the handling of bread and vines; no explicit moralizing. The final image of crumbs glowing in tea-light reweights prior motifs without statement. Subtext in the empty chair’s silent acceptance is effective, though the ambiguity is slightly safe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent (“heuristically gentle yet unrelenting”). Perceptual signature is strong—every noticed weed or crumb is filtered through the noticer’s quiet yearning. No POV drift; compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense yet clear; rhythm modulates with emotional beats. Occasional elevated diction (“tenuous absolution,” “conceptual repricing”) fits the meditative register. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is controlled and never muddies causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise of a “creeping normality noticer” reclaiming sanctity via guerrilla gardening is fresh and specific. Familiar motifs—ruined palace, vanished bakery—are transformed through sensory precision and quiet ritual. The synthesis feels inevitable; risk is understated but coherent.</comment>
