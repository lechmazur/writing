<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira’s arc is embodied and specific—her trauma responses do alter tactics (the path-finding through pain is dramatized). The shift from survival tool to redemptive beacon for the pewter strap lands with felt cost and micro-choice on page. Interior contradiction—desire to end darkness while re-entering it through memory—is held in simultaneous tension. Small drift: the moment the ‘mathematics of mercy’ is spoken aloud leans summary, blurring the strict dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of pain-flash → insight accumulates until the forest retracts and normal moss replaces violet light—Reconfiguring meaning with clear before/after. Each flash is a tightening constraint that strips options until the final equation emerges. There is no closure ambiguity; the strap’s warm golden tilt is the earned image that repays accumulated cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fine-selective violets, pewter gleams, and warm amber shift serve as atmospheric pressure instead of postcard backdrop. Ultraviolet forest behaves like an active antagonist—changing color in tempo with Lira’s skin cost—so setting choices shape tactics on page. Scale and detail stay proportionate to stakes; physical anchors root the POV in every beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding a calculable mercy via own remembered pain—starts early and tightens through each violet flash. Each revelation demands payment of searing light: a visible cost that raises price under the Accumulative lens. The meaningful pressure deepening is the acceptance that mercy equals remembering pain instead of erasing it; this crystallizes in the climactic equation and the forest’s withdrawal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>The theme emerges via the embodied equation rather than explicit moral. Mathematics reframed as compassion grows out of bruised skin and pulsing strap-light, not an authorial aside. Final image resounds non-literally: ‘ordinary green moss’ reweights the preceding ultraviolet horrors by revealing mercy as lived, scar-bearing geometry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Compressed lyric syntax remains coherent and character-specific under stress. Sentence rhythm breathes with each flash-brace; no template drumming or filter stacks. Micro-texture (pewter arcs on glowing moss) reflects Lira’s sensorily altered POV without POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Strokes are dense, never loitering; each sentence pushes atmosphere or insight. Two near-loop fragments early on (‘She braced herself…She braced again’) are purposeful accumulative beats rather than scaffold. Elsewhere, fresh verbs and varied openings sustain propulsion near the closure line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>The trauma-mapping forest and mathematics-of-mercy equation synthesize into an original emotional device. Fresh angle: using interrogation numerals as generative score for compassion is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk taken—the violet-forest self-penance—pays off with conceptual reconfiguration without gimmickry.</comment>
