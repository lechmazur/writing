<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The guardian’s interiority is poetic but abstract; no contradictory impulses or micro-choices are dramatized. Its “silent empathy” remains a label rather than a felt tension that alters tactics. The final lowering of the mirror is a gesture, not a decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the night “holds the stars close” after the guardian’s weave. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern builds, then reweights meaning. Cost is conceptual (darkness taught) but thinly felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt dock’s wet planks, mirrored glare, and canal tension are vividly selective and constrain the guardian’s method. The dental mirror’s gleam charges the final lattice of light. Spatial choreography is clean; every shimmer is tethered to the POV’s action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stakes—“teach darkness the value of stars”—are declared early but never tested or tightened. No reversal or trade-off narrows options; the weave proceeds unopposed. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image: darkness learning starlight via mirrored water. The final tableau reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext is strong in gesture and silence, though the epiphany leans abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and textured—“spiralingly calm precision,” “shutters of water.” Perceptual signature is distinct; every ripple is filtered through the guardian’s silent stance. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet controlled; rhythm breathes with the scene’s hush. Occasional stacked metaphors (“lenses of polished steel, a dental mirror held gently against the darkness”) flirt with overwriting but stay purposeful. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The premise—a mute guardian teaching night with mirrored water—feels fresh, synthesizing myth and optics. Risk lies in the abstract stakes; specificity of the dock and mirror keeps it grounded. Not transformative, but memorably particular.</comment>
