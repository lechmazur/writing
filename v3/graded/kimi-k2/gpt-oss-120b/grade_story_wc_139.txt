<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradictions (con-artist’s honest offspring) vividly propel the ink contract beat; her ‘fair-trade mathematics’ offer deliberate moral anchoring under pressure. Embodied waiting balances resolve and doubt; the renunciation of con-man legacy is earned on parchment and felt.</comment>

<comment>Measured, elastic sentences accelerate as glow arrives. One skimmed repetendum (“ink began to *swirl*”) prevents 9- band edge.</comment>
