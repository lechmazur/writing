<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The titan’s regally unpretentious presence is dramatized through micro-choices (brushing the crown, trembling fingers with the pellet) and embodied emotion under pressure; interior contradiction is shown when awe at the library wars with duty. Motivation intensifies from quiet purpose to vocal judgment, aligning with causal escalation. The only drag is a slight emotional tidy-up at fade-out; overall the portrait is vivid and singular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: oracle’s clue → pellet → map → crown touch → temple collapse forms a tight because/therefore chain. Closure lands with a crystallized stance—throne returns to legitimate blood—made legible by the fading specter and ink’s dark seal. Cost is seen in the sundering stone and the titan’s quiet pride, satisfying the Resonant Reconfiguration gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory density is highly selective (dust, papyrus scent, starlight wisp) and every major object—scroll aisles, cracked crown, bleeding ink—constrains movement or recharges the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as cracks spider outward and ceiling bows. The library itself feels like a dying organism whose collapse mirrors the lie’s exposure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and tightens via each deciphered fragment until the final exposure strips the specter’s sovereignty. Escalation is causal and embodied: every new clue increases the titan’s agency while narrowing the impostor’s options. The price is the literal collapse of the old order, felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of truth’s weight, legitimacy versus illusion, and impermanence emerge from particulars (ink stain, disintegrating crown) without statement. Final refrain of graceful collapse reweights the opening “hushed cathedral” into a requiem that mourns and renews simultaneously. No moralizing—resonance stays lodged in image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice remains a controlled lyric incantation, modulating between vaulted grandeur and intimate breath. Syntax varies and avoids loops; diction stays within the titan’s heightened but believable lexicon. The narrative stance balances awe with procedural clarity, no POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose glows—sentences dense with layered work (“ink spread like a slow tide, unveiling letters that were not written by any hand”). No filler or scaffold; rhythm inhales during discovery then accelerates into collapse. Tiny lapses—one redundant pair of clauses—are too mild to blemish a final beat this exquisite.</comment>

<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Familiar quest for true heir is re-envisioned through the library’s temporal drift and a titan whose scale is both literal and cosmic. The iron gall ink pellet and rune-of-drift as forensic devices give procedural freshness. Synthesis feels inevitable; no templates echo. Minor deduction for echo of spectral false king trope (still potent).</comment>
