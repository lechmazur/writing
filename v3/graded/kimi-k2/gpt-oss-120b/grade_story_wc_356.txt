<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her olfactory gift and doodle ritual are embodied—but her arc is more observational than choice-driven; the final beat is a communal epiphany rather than a personal cost. No contradictory impulse is dramatized in scene; serenity is affirmed, not tested. The corpse flower’s bloom feels inevitable, not earned by a crucible choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of scent, doodle, and tide imagery tightens toward the bloom’s charged poise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the village breathes the “wildflower hush” and adopts the doodle custom—yet the cost is diffuse, borne collectively rather than by Lira alone. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The treetop village is rendered with lush, selective sensory detail; the warm birch trunk and mist-clad canopy function as micro-setting that houses the seed and focuses attention. Environment constrains only modestly—no spatial or resource pressure—but the final image of swaying leaves recharging the “wildflower hush” gives the setting closure weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early and revisited through scent shifts and communal breath. Escalation is textural: density of perfume, doodles, and hush intensifies until the bloom releases its truth. Yet the tightening is collective; Lira’s personal agency and visible cost remain muted, keeping pressure just below the 7.0 gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of serenity-through-motion emerges organically from scent, doodle, and tide motifs; no explicit moralizing. The final communal inhalation reweights earlier images without stating a thesis. Subtext is present but leans toward affirmation rather than tension; complexity is gentle, not sharply ambiguous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and sensorily precise; “olfactorily sensitive” and “wildflower hush” are coined phrases that feel native to the narrator’s perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates with the bloom’s crescendo. No dialogue to test, but internal monologue avoids filter clutter and maintains psychic distance.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; figurative language is patterned and pays off in the final perfume. Occasional stacked modifiers (“mysterious treetop village clung to ancient vines like a secret garden suspended in the sky”) flirt with excess but serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; momentum breathes with the tide.</comment>

<comment>The corpse-flower-as-wisdom-relic trope is refreshed by olfactory choreography and communal doodle ritual. Specificity of scent-notes and wrapping-paper custom feels idiosyncratic rather than borrowed. Risk is lyrical rather than structural; the quiet ending is earned but not boldly unconventional.</comment>
