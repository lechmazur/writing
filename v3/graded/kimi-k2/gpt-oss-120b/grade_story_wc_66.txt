<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is thistled-calm and embodied, but the final choice to become “bridge” feels slightly abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized on the page, only stated. The ledger transcription is a concrete micro-choice that links motive to action, yet the cost remains atmospheric rather than personal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s silence is broken and dust “learns” to speak, with Mara’s ledger glowing as visible cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of luminous ink and dust builds to cadence shift. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality break.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ember alcove, mist, and radio dial constrain every move; the dial’s glow literally guides the audience and charges the final image. Micro-setting (desk, ledger, shawl) functions as extension of character body. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—radio crackle overrules sight at key beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reviving the city’s stories—is signaled early; escalation is a single density wave: pirate broadcast → transcription → collective listening. No external antagonist; pressure is hunger for narrative. Cost is diffuse (shared rather than personal), so 8.8 gate not met.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the accumulation: silence transmuted into shared song, dust as communal memory. Final image of glowing dust reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in the shawl’s hum and the ledger’s pulse—no thematic echo in dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; patterned elision (“thistled calm” repeated) is taught early and paid off in final hush. Perceptual signature is Mara’s synesthetic hearing—chords in static, dust tracing melody. No dialogue, so no voice contamination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“fireflies trapped in amber,” “dust like old parchment”) flirt with overwriting yet serve texture. No loops or filter-verb stacks. Final cadence slows elegantly to crystallize closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: pirate radio + orchestra copyist + sentient dust feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk lies in lyric accumulation rather than plot twists; it pays off in the glowing-ledger image. No derivative premise issues.</comment>
