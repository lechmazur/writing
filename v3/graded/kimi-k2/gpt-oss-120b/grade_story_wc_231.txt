<comment>Marlowe is vivid—his frayed coat and boutonnière anchor a loner whose method of “reading” sea-gaps feels credible. Inner loneliness morphs from void to canvas, lending earned emotion to the final stance. Only mild abstraction around “stranger’s borrowed memory” dilutes edge.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The causal arc is tight: receipt of journal → gap-decoding → Edelweiss returned as beacon. Closure lands in an Earned Stasis where cost is quiet yet legible—Marlowe accepts permanent solitude to shelter future souls. One soft beat: the stranger’s step pattern is inferred rather than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Opal mist, bruised-lavender reflections, and the tactile salt-grit on petal are precise. The dock and tide physically constrain Marlowe’s pacing; the tower lamp’s sweep becomes a conclusive instrument. A touch of postcard poeticism (“endless passing”) barely nicks specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: give voice to a ghost memory while reconciling his own isolation. Pressure tightens as gaps reveal lyrical “cost lines” and climaxes when he aligns bloom to longest tide-lull. The invisible stranger offers no push-back—conflict is internal—but agency carries.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme of custodianship of lost stories blooms without preachiness. Image of “ribbons of gold” over gaps reweights prior solitude as service. Final image reframes loneliness as luminous responsibility—resonant CR, free of sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled: “bruised lavender,” “hollow sigh,” rhythms suited to an aging keeper-poet. Compression (“pauses matched spaces between pressed petals”) teaches lyric decoding and pays off. Only one brief tag drift in “the stranger had slipped—” line.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>High density—sea, petal, lamp condensed into layered imagery. Occasional slight cadence wobble (“softly persistent rhythm” repeated) and a surplus of “softly” and “echo,” but never stalls momentum. Climactic line “quiet comfort of being truly seen” lands clear.</comment>

<comment>Lighthouse keeper decoding tide gaps with a dried alpine flower is an elegant, unlikely synthesis. Transformation turns clichés of isolation into stewardship of forgotten lives—specific yet subtle originality.</comment>
