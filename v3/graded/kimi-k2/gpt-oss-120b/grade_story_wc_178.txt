<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Nabu’s interiority is vividly hoard-smart and math-precise, and every grain-count or star-chart directly pushes his final covenant sketch; the irony of rationing grain while decoding infinity is embodied and shapes micro-moves at outset and altar.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causality holds under Accum/Textural lens: traced schematic → alignment → violet glow. Closure lands with Charged Poise as tile hums and heaven answers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Balcony constellations, stone corridors, altar violet bridge all generate spatial resources that undergird the final arc-glow; recurrent dusk dust re-weights in the climax image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cosmic promise for people) narrows when numbers + sky alignment force irrevocable pact. Cost felt in visible violet light-bride—qualifying tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme crystallizes without moral: numbers once measuring barley now measuring destiny. Non-literal final glow answers the silent prayers wordlessly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct frugal-saint voice persists; “dust spirals of possibility” and astro-cant rhythm match pressure; purple finale modulates tone rather than explodes it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (“lean as pantry” then “vaulted heavens”); some ornamental colon-opening loops are purposeful and are paid off via line-break echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Treatment of magic-square covenant reconfigures familiar vault-of-heaven trope with time-bound diplomatic urgency—fresh fusion that earns final hum.</comment>
