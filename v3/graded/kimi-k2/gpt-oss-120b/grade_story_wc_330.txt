<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her hands “moving like prayer,” her song rising “like a gentle wind”—but the story leans on lyrical summary rather than dramatized contradiction. The final choice to descend the new staircase is motivated, yet the cost feels conceptual rather than embodied. Still, her craft-as-listening identity is specific and consistent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the train’s silence is reweighted into a traveling symphony, cost paid by Mara’s irreversible descent into the mirror-cavern. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each repetition of “misting hush” thickens the fog of possibility. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The circus train is tactile—rusted rails, soot-gray wood, brass lilies—and the halo fragment’s gleam physically guides Mara’s repair and descent. Micro-setting (the hidden compartment, the mirrored cavern) constrains her next move. A few phrases drift toward postcard lyricism, keeping it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“interpret silence as possibility”—is signaled early and tightened when Mara must decide to follow the staircase. Pressure grows via the intensifying fog and the train’s remembered laughter, but the final cost is more conceptual than visceral. One clear tightening beat suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence not as absence but as generative medium. The final image of “ribbons of light” reweights every prior hush without moralizing. A hairline slip toward abstraction in the closing sentences keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that mirrors the carousel’s turning. Sensory diction (“misting hush,” “whispering gleam”) is consistent and character-bound. No head-hopping; compression is purposeful and taught early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense, but occasional stacked metaphors (“wind bells chimed inside the chime of wind bells”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold; momentum holds. A single mixed image—“tapestry of muted stars”—slightly muddies clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of abandoned circus, amber moon-shard, and silence-as-song feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through Mara’s craft and the train’s metamorphosis. Risky lyric structure pays off in the resonant closure.</comment>
