<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lush but abstract; the poet’s “shyly unstoppable” trait never collides with a concrete choice that costs him something. The centuries-long frame keeps pain at a safe distance, so the coral-gathering heart reads more as lyrical motif than embodied flaw driving a final renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric CR: the nebulae burst reweights the shell into “a library of light.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and cadence shift lands. Yet the cost is diffuse—centuries of longing are summarized, not dramatized—so the felt price is oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Shell, reef, and postcard are vividly rendered and return in the final image to charge the closure. The micro-setting (stone walls drinking song-light) constrains the method and mirrors interior state. Spatial anchors are clear; only the time dilation across centuries stays lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—turn pain into beauty—stays coherent, but escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical. One tightening: postcard blooms and sea pauses. Cost is conceptual (eternal caretaking) yet never manifests as a concrete forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of transmuting sorrow into generative art emerges through image-constellations, not statement. Final galaxy-bloom offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is eternal song liberation or cage? Complexity feels earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is oceanic, tidal, and consistent; diction (“reef-shadow joy,” “blossom armistice”) creates a distinct perceptual signature. Patterned lyric elision is taught early and paid off. No POV drift; the poet’s sensorium remains the sole lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; occasional stacked metaphors (“wound he could mend… scar he could turn into a petal”) flirt with excess but stay legible. Rhythm modulates with emotional swell. No loops or scaffold, but density could breathe more at peak.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Premise—immortal poet in a shell converting grief into cosmic flora—is fresh synthesis of mythic and lyric modes. Tropes (lonely artist, message in bottle) are transformed through sustained sensory cosmology. Risky compression of centuries feels justified by accumulative design.</comment>
