<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“felt his purpose confirmed”), but the tester’s contradictory impulses (curiosity vs stewardship) are stated more than dramatized; the final renunciation of the old rope is earned and carries visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: the bell’s new silence reconfigures the sanctuary’s role and the tester’s identity. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; the glue-drying wait and sensor sync tighten the pattern toward the final hush.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Wind-scoured sanctuary, glass panes, and drifting cloud-veil are selective and purposeful; the bell tower’s spine and the chest that stores the retired rope constrain the final choice, charging the last image with felt cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“favor listening over noise”—is signaled early and tightened through the sensor calibration; the zero-hour microclimate surge forces the first true test, narrowing options and exacting the cost of relinquishing the old mechanism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tester’s embodied labor and the bell’s transformed voice; the final hush offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the premise that silence can be a form of devotion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to pressure shifts and glass resonance; rhythm modulates with the solstice hush, and no head-hopping occurs. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional elevated diction (“solstice hush,” “humming veil”) skirts purple but remains voice-consistent. No loops or scaffold; final image crystallizes without figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The storm-siren-tester premise is fresh, synthesizing meteorology and monastic ritual; the microclimate-triggered bell feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of driftwood ribs and conductive filaments grounds the concept, and the quiet rebellion against clamor is a bold, coherent stance.</comment>
