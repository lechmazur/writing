<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s desire to “feel the texture of time passing” is embodied in her tactile handling of relics and the urn fragment; the final map of memory-threads gives her the payoff at visible cost. Interiority stays concrete, but the borrowed-time premise is asserted more than dramatized until the last beat. Micro-choices (placing the fragment, brushing dust, narrating to villagers) align with motive and foreclose solitude. Still, no contradictory impulses are staged in scene—she moves with steady certainty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the capsule’s reunion with the urn fragment reweights time itself, and the valley inhales “the future” with felt collective cost. Causal chain—ledger clue → hourglass → map—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat adds density rather than forcing reversal. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“dust-laden valley”). No teleporting props or amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The emerald silo’s green panes, cracked capsule glass, and shimmering sand-constellations are vivid and selective, filtering through Mara’s tactile priorities. The silo-as-antenna concept constrains the final revelation: its walls become the map’s canvas. Micro-setting (urn fragment, hourglass) doubles as setting and tool. Weather and geography remain stable; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the capsule’s purpose before the valley’s “last grain”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once when the urn fragment clicks and the map unfurls, foreclosing Mara’s solitude and charging the villagers with shared custodianship. Cost is collective and conceptual rather than personal injury, but still legible. Agency remains active throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of time as communal tapestry emerges from the capsule’s brokenness and the villagers’ memory-notes; no explicit moralizing. Subtext lives in the urn fragment (death → continuity) and the silo’s green glow. Final image of “silver sand” constellations reweights earlier dust without statement. Complexity is honored—no tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mara’s sensory bias; diction (“ticking relics,” “timeless hymn”) is textured and consistent. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with wonder. Compression and lyric elision are taught early and paid off in the final shimmer. Dialogue is absent, so no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean yet lyrical; each sentence advances image or action. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful (“minutes stretching like thin silk”). Rhythm accelerates at the click, then exhales with the villagers’ gathering. Clean grammar and precise spatial tracking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The garage-sale cipher premise feels fresh and inevitable; capsule damage as intentional key is a non-obvious twist. Emerald silo as time-antenna synthesizes lighthouse and hourglass motifs without gimmickry. Specificity of the ash-gray urn fragment anchors the speculative frame. Risky lyric compression succeeds.</comment>
