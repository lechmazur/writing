<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selene’s interior contradiction—trading doubt for wonder—drives every micro-choice; the final renunciation of perfect symmetry is earned through the reed’s cumulative cost. Her embodied perception (color through scent, cadence of shadows) is vivid and specific. The innocently cunning trait constrains tactics: she must barter sunrise pigment to coax each hue, a visible price. Flaws remain luminous rather than resolved, satisfying Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the courtyard’s new glass garden reframes imperfection as melody. Causal chain—arrange plants → reed sings → color revealed → mural completed—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One felt cost: Selene forfeits literal red vision for synesthetic perception. Orientation anchors by line 3; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The courtyard’s glass walls and furnace heat constrain choices (pigment availability, reed warmth). Micro-setting: the cracked vase beside the furnace becomes a charged object that reappears in the mural. Sensory hierarchy favors Selene’s colorblind palette—scent, texture, temperature—filtering every detail. Spatial choreography tracks the circle of cereus and the ivy-lotus intertwine cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trading awakenings to complete her palette—tightens with each barter; the final ivy-lotus union forecloses further trades. Escalation is accumulative: each hue costs sunrise pigment, narrowing resources. No external antagonist; pressure arises from Selene’s own flawed bargain. Cost is visible: wilted rosemary beside thriving cactus literalizes the price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: cracked vase, reed’s metallic sigh, phoenix ash—beauty in fracture. Final image of glass flowers reflecting “a spectrum no eye could name” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in plant whispers and pigment barter implies creation’s cost. No thematic echo; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Selene’s synesthetic perception; no head-hopping. Distinct diction—“shards of sunrise,” “stubborn green”—mirrors her colorblind worldview. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long lyrical sentences during discovery, clipped fragments at climax. Dialogue is absent; narrative voice carries subtext through sensory metaphor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each line advances color, cost, or wonder. No loops or synonym churn. Metaphors stay coherent—“reed tongue…breathing spine”—without muddle. Occasional elevated diction (“fractured palette”) fits Selene’s artistic lens. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: colorblind synesthesia + plant-reed barter + phoenix aftermath. Tropes transformed: the phoenix is backdrop, not protagonist; imperfection is melody, not flaw. Specificity grounds fantasy: furnace heat, cracked vase, jasmine-named hue. Risky lyric structure pays off in glass-flower closure. No derivative echoes.</comment>
