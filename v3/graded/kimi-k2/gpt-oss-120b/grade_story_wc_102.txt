<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Milo’s spiritual curiosity is embodied in breath-synced micro-choices; the interior contradiction between wonder and ache is palpable. The final renunciation—setting the camera aside—earns its cost through prior causal linkage to the tear and the lattice. No secondary character on page, so relationship crucible waived. Flaw: the “pilgrim of sparks” label is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the reservoir opens, love flows outward, and Milo’s stance crystallizes in a Charged Poise. Causal chain—tear → map → filament → release—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Cost is visible in the dimming tear and lifted lens weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The viaduct’s jasmine-scented stone and violet fog constrain breathing rhythm, which in turn governs the magical aperture. Micro-setting (cracked tile, lens, tear) functions as geography that must be aligned. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and urgent. Final image of glowing blossoms recharges the opening “sleeping dragon” metaphor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free unused love—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the lattice brightens only when Milo’s breath slows, forcing a visible trade-off of time and bodily control. Escalation is Accumulative: density of light and memory increases until release. Cost is the tear’s extinguished glow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of compassion’s circulation emerges from concrete action (breath, filament, lattice) rather than statement. Final image of sparks touching passersby offers non-literal answer to “where does unused love go?” Subtext operates in the tear’s silent pulse and the camera’s prayer-like click. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture: “twilight cloaked the stone in violet mist,” “chest expand like a lantern.” Perceptual signature is consistent—selective, synesthetic, spiritually attuned. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Rhythm modulates with breathing beats; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density; each sentence layers image, emotion, and motion. Occasional stacked metaphors (“sleeping dragon,” “river of sparks”) risk overwriting but pattern is taught early and paid off. No loops or scaffold. Final paragraph achieves luminous concision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: camera obscura as spiritual stethoscope, unused love as lattice rather than liquid. Risky lyric compression succeeds without clarity loss. Transformation test: story collapses if Milo is merely a photographer. Specificity of Kwan Yin’s tear and jasmine pollen anchors universals.</comment>
