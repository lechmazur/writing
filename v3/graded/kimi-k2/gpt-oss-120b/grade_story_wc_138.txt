<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The immortal’s ennui is palpable and embodied (“eyes heavy”), but interiority drifts toward abstraction (“centuries of ennui”). His choice to follow the amulet is dramatized, yet the contradiction between boredom and curiosity is asserted rather than enacted in real time. The final renunciation of emptiness feels earned because the magnetic pivot reconfigures his stance, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the immortal’s goodbye to emptiness is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights eternity itself. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each prismatic echo and magnetic tremor layers until the final crystallizing tunnel. The spatial mutiny is taught early and paid off in the folding corridors. No orientation debt; anchors are vivid by line 5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The crystalline cavern, magnetic fields, and prismatic escondite are not mere backdrop; they constrain movement and literally reshape space around the protagonist. The violet-to-amber cascade mirrors internal shift, and the “spatial mutiny” forces the final corridor choice. Sensory economy is high—ozone scent, chilled promise—without catalog bloat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“discover what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early and tightened when the lattice of corridors presents successive farewells. The protagonist’s agency is to step through rather than retreat, narrowing his options to one luminous tunnel. Cost is felt as the amulet dissolves into dust, a visible forfeiture. Escalation is steady, not steep, but coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the magnetic pivot: goodbye as transition, not termination. Subtext lives in gesture—the amulet’s dissolution, the twin’s whisper—never in sermon. The final image of sparkling dust reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity is honored: eternity remains, but its texture changes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“hushed thunder,” “prismatic echoes”). Perceptual signature is consistent: the immortal notices magnetic scent and color shifts, not tourist catalog. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Compression like “lover’s sigh” is taught early and paid off in the final whisper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; sentences often do two jobs (“walls rippling, colors shifting”). Occasional elevated diction (“spatial mutiny”) is voice-motivated. One minor loop: “humming” appears three times in close succession. Otherwise, no scaffold or redundancy. Final line anchors the image cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of magnetic topology and metaphysical farewell feels fresh; the folding corridor is not a stock portal but a prismatic lattice born of solar storm resonance. The immortal’s boredom-to-purpose arc avoids cliché by tying transition to spacetime curvature. Risk is taken in the lyric, non-linear structure, and it pays off.</comment>
