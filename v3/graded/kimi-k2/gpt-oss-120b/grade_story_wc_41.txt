<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prophet’s interior contradiction—yearning to remember while fated to forget—drives every beat; the embodied ache of “half-remembered songs” and the micro-choice to record the aging-hum onto a battered cassette anchor motive. Yet the driftwood markers feel more scenic than tactical, and the final smile reads slightly tidy given the prior fatalism.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chalk line becomes a “ghost ship’s horn,” reweighting the premise from capture to release. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each driftwood arrow and fog breath thickens the pattern until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in the prophet’s acceptance that forgetting is inevitable, yet the driftwood mechanics could be causally tighter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The fog sculpture garden is no backdrop; its shifting vapor literally holds the chalk line and forces the prophet to navigate by touch and memory. Sensory hierarchy is precise—cool chalk grain, sea-foam breath—yet the garden’s rules remain consistent without exposition. The setting constrains the final choice: only fog thick enough can “hold a permanent sigh.”</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture the sound of aging—tightens once when the chalk etches the hum and the prophet chooses release over possession. Pressure escalates via Accumulative density: each driftwood marker and tape hiss layers urgency until the final reconfiguration. The cost is felt in the prophet’s relinquishment, though the middle beats could sharpen the trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as tide, not archive. The chalk’s white line and the cassette’s hiss embody the paradox of trying to fix what must flow. Final image—the slab warming under sunrise—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. One near-label phrase (“sound of growing older”) slightly dilutes subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet grounded: “rusted metal and old newspaper clippings,” “sea foam pressing against a distant shore.” Syntax modulates with emotional swell—long rolling clauses mimic tide, then contract at the chalk touch. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays locked to the prophet’s precognitive haze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, but disciplined: each image advances atmosphere or motive. Occasional stacked metaphors (“tide of longing… moonlit wave… shells onto the shore”) flirt with overwriting yet serve the Accumulative pattern. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The junkyard prophet who etches aging into fog is a fresh synthesis; the chalk-as-recorder and cassette-as-relic transform familiar motifs. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration. One faint echo of “ghost ship” trope keeps it from the top band.</comment>
