<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“skin felt thinner”), but the shift from death-seeker to life-listener is asserted more than dramatized; the final resolve is credible yet leans on summary rather than a visible micro-choice that costs something concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the storm-wreckage pattern, lace tip, and wind motif accrue until the closing image reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—“the fold in patience open like a flower”—with felt cost (abandoning planned suicide) legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Drift-ice marina is vivid and selective; the broken buoy becomes a micro-setting that anchors the communal ritual and final image. Environment constrains movement (ice groans under boots) and supplies the “choir of surrender” that reframes the stake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—will the narrator choose death or stay to hear endings?—tightens once when the wind’s lullaby reframes the quest. Cost is present (abandoning the parasol tip’s original purpose) but could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of solace-through-endings emerges organically from trawled wreckage and wind-song; final image reweights the parasol tip from suicide compass to gratitude token without moralizing. Subtext in the volunteers’ silent hand-on-buoy is resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—compressed, lyrical, oceanic. Perceptual signature filters every detail through cold, patience, and salt. Patterned elision (“fold in patience”) is taught early and paid off at closure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“choir of surrender,” “pages turning in a book long closed”) risk overwriting but stay within voice. No loops or scaffold; rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Clean mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: euthanasia tourism meets disaster-relief trawling, reframed by lace heirloom and wind-music. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight; risk-taking (lyric accumulation, quiet ending) heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
