<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her “gentle twist of hidden gears” credo is embodied in the stealth placement of the box—but the monks remain collective silhouettes; Kovan’s jaw unfurling is the only embodied micro-choice we witness. The cellular-memory premise is asserted rather than dramatized inside any monk’s skin, so the change feels administered rather than earned at cellular scale.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the wanderer’s kneel and whispered promise crystallize a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—his anger dissolves into the stones. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each touch of the box layers a cadence shift until the final image reweights the whole. One causality wobble: the pin’s vanishing/reappearing rule is never tested under pressure; it simply obeys need.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The obsidian sanctuary’s sound-absorption is tactile—“absorbed every echo”—and the porous night-phase literally lets thoughts slip through stone, constraining Mara’s timing. The music box itself becomes micro-setting, its cool lid and pulsing pin anchoring every beat. Spatial choreography stays coherent; only the wanderer’s entrance feels slightly disembodied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—release resentment—signaled early; pressure tightens as each monk’s touch forecloses the option of clinging to grudges. Agency is mostly Mara’s, but the monks’ collective thaw lacks individual cost; the wanderer finally pays with his kneel and promise. Escalation is steady but gentle, fitting the pacifist frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of non-violent transformation emerges through tactile ritual rather than sermon; the final lullaby echo reweights the cellular-memory premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the shimmer of the floor “as if the sanctuary itself had exhaled.” Avoids tidy binaries; resentment is released, not judged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with rhythmic control—“shifting grace,” “muted mural”—that modulates under pressure. POV stays tight to Mara, then widens to the wanderer without head-hop; the final unseen Mara placement preserves mystery. Distinct perceptual signature throughout.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense and musical—“vaulted heart of a soundless sanctuary”—yet propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“cellular memory,” “conceptual repricing”) risks register drift but stays within Mara’s cerebral lexicon. Clean mechanics; final image lands with crystalline clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Familiar pacifist trope is refreshed by the broken music box’s conditional magic and the sanctuary’s porous nights. The cellular-memory conceit feels novel in this ritual context; the wanderer’s lullaby callback is an earned surprise. Specificity of obsidian silence and pulse-through-skin detail prevents generic overlay.</comment>
