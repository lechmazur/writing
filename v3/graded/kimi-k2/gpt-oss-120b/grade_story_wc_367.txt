<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s centuries-long vigil and her whispered vow give her interiority weight, yet the herald remains a cipher whose laughter never crystallizes into motive or contradiction; the final choice is earned but the relationship crucible is under-used.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s vow to “guide the dawn” crystallizes the new stance with felt cost—the ancient shadows now veil the sunrise. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; the newspaper’s fall is the pattern-break that reweights the ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, prism, and lantern are vivid micro-settings that constrain every tactical move; the phosphorescent algae and sapphire currents charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, though “basalt steps” and “cliffs” could be more tightly anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shape a new dawn—tightens once when the accidentally prophetic symbols force immediate action; the cost is the irreversible veiling of sunrise. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification rather than causal reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth through shadowed sacrifice emerges from concrete particulars; the final image of “shadowed elation” reweights earlier laughter without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will the world thank them?—but complexity feels earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; perceptual signature filters every image through Mira’s weighted patience. Syntax modulates with pressure—“serpent of light” accelerates, then cadence softens into the dawn hush. No head-hopping; herald’s laughter is reported, not ventriloquized.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers image and motion. Occasional stacked metaphors (“living serpent of light…steering the storm”) flirt with overwriting yet serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with the ritual’s arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse myth and climate elegy; the newspaper-as-epoch-end is a non-obvious hinge. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final reconfiguration. Echoes of familiar storm-herald tropes are transformed through Mira’s centuries-long POV.</comment>
