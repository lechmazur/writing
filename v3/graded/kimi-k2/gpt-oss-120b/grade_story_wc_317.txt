<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her whispered promise to the seed is embodied and stakes her identity—but the story never tests her limits or flaws; she orchestrates rather than suffers. No contradictory impulse is dramatized, so the final triumph feels pre-ordained, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bloom reweights the premise, and the cost is the perpetual obligation to keep inventing. Causal links (seed → cipher → airflow → bloom) hold, yet the participants’ agency is off-stage, softening the decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The shed, brook, and vents are tactile and atmospheric; the orthogonal airflow system literally shapes the final bloom. However, the broader town remains a sketch, so the environment constrains only the immediate puzzle, not wider stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—safeguarding imaginative space—surfaces early and tightens as each cipher unlocks literal breathing room. Yet the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no participant forfeits anything tangible, muting the pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of cultivated wonder emerges through the living puzzle, not exposition. The final image of the bloom as “a map of constellations” offers a resonant, non-moral answer, though the story flirts with overt metaphor (“ideas flow through orthogonal pathways”).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent—rain “muffling the town as if the sky itself had decided to hold its breath.” Compression and lyric elision are taught early and paid off in the bloom’s vapor-constellation. No dialogue to test distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, sound, and motion. Occasional purple flourishes (“silver rain,” “constellations drawn in vapor”) risk overwriting but serve the climactic sensory overload. No loops or scaffolds detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The living escape-room seed is a fresh synthesis of puzzle and organism; the orthogonal airflow as narrative engine is inventive. Risk is moderate—concept could tip into gimmickry—but the grounded sensory detail keeps it specific and earned.</comment>
