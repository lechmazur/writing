<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s skeptical stance and explorer identity are embodied in micro-choices (weighing reverberations, leaving the wheel), but interiority occasionally drifts into abstract summary (“drowsy alertness” repeated). The renunciation is earned and carries cost, yet the religious skepticism never collides with the ghost-shift material in a way that forces a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Mara’s refusal to remove the wheel reconfigures the stakes (swallowed truth stays buried) with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—each layer of sound and radio fragment tightens the pattern until the final hush. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tunnel’s rust, hum, and chill constrain movement and attention; the beaded wheel’s glimmer becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. One spatial drift: “parallel to the mill’s derelict tracks” is never re-anchored inside the tunnel.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—quantify the swallowed truth—tightens through each decoded radio fragment. Agency is cerebral (pattern derivation) but still narrows options to leave or take the wheel; cost is the weight settling in Mara’s ribs. No external antagonist needed; pressure remains coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: the ethics of measuring versus carrying guilt. Subtext lives in the ghost shift’s low thrum and the valve’s calibrated beads. Final image of the quiet prayer Mara never intended to utter reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is textured, skeptical, and perceptually specific—“pulse of drowsy alertness,” “frozen syllables.” Syntax modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. One register slip: “emotional tonnage” edges toward editorial rather than experiential diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; metaphors mostly cohere. Minor loop: “drowsy alertness” appears three times without pattern payoff. No clarity breaks, but the closing cadence could breathe more.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fusion of industrial archaeology, midnight-radio occult, and moral quantification feels fresh. Ghost shift as palpable hum rather than clichéd haunting is a sharp inflection. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
