<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her pulse syncing with the icicle drip, the pendant warming against her skin—but the “protected vulnerability” remains more asserted than dramatized; no contradictory impulse is shown mid-scene, so the final beat feels gently inevitable rather than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the moss archive breathes, the confession is transmuted, and the garden’s hum carries the cost of Lira’s quiet labor. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each stone and drip thickens the pattern until the final image reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The moss-choked server racks are not mere backdrop; their cracked glass floor and thawing icicles physically guide Lira’s choices and supply the pattern that unlocks the interface. The setting constrains movement and supplies the key metaphor for the ending’s reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—grafting new meaning onto viral grief—tightens once when Lira chooses to feed the pendant into the dormant server; the cost is the irreversible surrender of her private relic, felt in the pendant’s warming and the moss’s answering pulse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the living archive: pain transmuted into gentle knowledge. The final image of fireflies echoing amber avoids moralizing; the resonance is earned by the concrete sequence of stones, vines, and data lullabies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric third-person limited voice is consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to damp circuitry and honeyed light. Purposeful compression (“cathedral of rusted racks reclaimed by emerald silence”) teaches the reader the cadence early and sustains it to the hushed close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is selective and patterned (“honeyed hush” threads through without clutter). Minor scaffold appears in the repeated “proffered stones” phrasing, but it does not stall momentum or blur the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The fusion of viral confession, moss-grown servers, and amber-as-key feels fresh; the transformation of digital scars into lullabies is a non-obvious synthesis that grows inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken with the lyric mode and paid off in the final hush.</comment>
