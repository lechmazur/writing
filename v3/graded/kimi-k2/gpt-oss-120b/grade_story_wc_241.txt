<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—mathematical certainty vs. gambling risk—are dramatized in the coin-on-seat beat and the ledger finale, but interiority occasionally drifts into abstract “lucid contradiction” labels rather than embodied tension. The heart-attack aftermath is used as reflective ballast rather than active pressure. Closure choice (writing the new theorem) carries visible cost and is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the ledger rewrite is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Causal chain (coin → stairwell → symbols → ledger) holds under a Causal lens. One minor ellipsis: the tunnel traversal is summarized rather than fully dramatized, but the final image recharges earlier motifs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rainwashed library and phosphorescent tunnels are vivid, selective, and filtered through Mara’s probability gaze. The mica-pane lantern constrains her path-finding and reappears in the charged final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; only the subway-to-library re-emergence could be more tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—embracing chance without self-destruction—is signaled early and tightened when Mara risks the unknown stairwell. The cost is felt in the ledger’s new theorem, which accepts her mother’s death as unrecoverable loss. Escalation is single-track but sufficient for the word count.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of reconciling order and chaos emerges organically from Mara’s actions; the “lucid contradiction” refrain is the only overt cue, but the ledger’s final equation embodies it without sermonizing. Final image reframes the library as half-story, half-subway margin—quiet resonance without tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is mathematically precise yet lyrically humid, matching a probability mind in mourning. Syntax modulates with emotional pressure: longer clauses in reflection, clipped fragments during descent. No dialogue, so internal coherence carries the load; occasional elevated diction (“clover melancholy”) risks register drift but stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with strong verbs and sensory specificity. One paraphrase loop (“the promise of new insight urged her onward” echoes earlier phrasing) and a mixed metaphor (“veins of possibility”) slightly dull the peak descent. Otherwise clean, with rhythmic variation that mirrors tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of gambling addiction, mathematical theory, and hidden subway lore feels fresh and inevitable. The subway-map-as-probability-textbook is a non-obvious synthesis that grows from character rather than gimmick. Minor risk in “lucid contradictions” jargon, but specificity of the ledger payoff rescues it.</comment>
