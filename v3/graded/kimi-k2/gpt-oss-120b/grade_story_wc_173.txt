<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; “bodily poetic rhythm” and “quiet hymn” remain metaphorical labels rather than embodied contradiction. The final renunciation—vanishing after the city awakens—earns a resonant stasis yet lacks a prior micro-choice that visibly costs her. Motivation to defy conformity is declared early but never tested in a specific dilemma. Character reads as archetype more than individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of untangling threads intensifies until the crystal chorus spills. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the city’s lullaby shattered, her form dissolving—cost felt in her erasure. Orientation is clear by line 3. One transition (courtyard → rooftops) is handled in a single sentence and does not break continuity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Silver courtyard, snow, and prism are vivid and selective; the prism’s facets constrain her tactile method and reappear in the final cascade. Spatial choreography is coherent; snow muffles steps, reflects light, and marks time. Micro-setting (her palm on crystal) functions as setting and tool. Weather and architecture subtly guide every move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break the city’s lullaby—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each untangled thread adds sonic density until the chorus erupts. Cost is conceptual—her own disappearance—felt in the final image. Agency is continuous; each loosened filament is a deliberate act that narrows her remaining anonymity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of art versus conformity emerges through the accumulating soundscape rather than statement. Final image of “rebellion, once a hush, now a hymn” reweights the opening serenity without moralizing. Subtext operates in the silence after her song. Complexity is preserved: the city may still choose conformity tomorrow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent; perceptual signature favors synesthetic fusion—“tasted of ice and ink.” Patterned elision (“between sigh and smile”) is taught early and paid off at exit. No dialogue, so no register drift. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences in reflection, clipped fragments during untangling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language rarely loops. Occasional stacked metaphors (“a sunrise trapped in ice”) risk overwriting yet serve the prism’s logic. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Final cascade sentence is clean and propulsive. Minor purple tinge keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: courtesan as chaste alchemist of sound, conformity as lullaby, rebellion as crystalline chorus. Tropes are inverted rather than recycled. Risky lyric mode commits fully and lands. Specificity of “colors no mortal eye could name” anchors the fantastical in sensory precision.</comment>
