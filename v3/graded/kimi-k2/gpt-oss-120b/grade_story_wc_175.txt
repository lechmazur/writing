<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is lyrically rendered but abstract; motives (honor histories) remain thematic rather than embodied crisis. No contradictory impulse presses her under higher stakes—she drifts rather than compromises. Actions (knots) signal intent yet lack granular physical tension. Choice to stay is Earned Stasis, yet cost stays atmospheric, not visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure (knot-seal with moth wing) satisfies Resonant Reconfiguration: history acknowledged, path renounced. Drive lens clearly Accumulative/Textural: patterning of light, wings, knots intensifies mood rather than causality. Causality remains poetic—glow pulses “in sync” but not because/therefore logic. Still, final image reweights premise with visible cost (her heart stays “transiently rooted”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Grotto is gorgeously sensory (“rosy hush,” “amber veil”) and bioluminescent moss directly charges final glow. Spatial anchoring arrives early; micro-setting (moth wing in palm) constrains choice to elevate it. Selective detail over breadth elevates stakes. Minor slippage: altitude logistics remain magical without early cue, but closure waives need for realism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Dominant stake (honor forgotten stories) is atmospheric; pressure rises only via poetic accretion. One deepening: last monarch brushes clouds – a beautiful cadence shift, not actionable trade-off. Cost lacks felt price beyond elegiac suspension. Insufficient tightening to narrow options under chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Theme of overlooked histories emerges cumulatively; no explicit moralizing. Moth wing and bioluminescent structures reweight each other sympathetically. Subtext remains delicate—perhaps too vaporous to leave gritty aftereffect. But avoidance of tidy lesson is principled.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrative voice is consistent, lyric, distinct syntactically. “Esoteric realist” diction maintained—compressed phrases (“orange whispers”) taught and paid off. No dialogue on page; internal monologue remains textured, coherent. Occasional floral layering risks overwriting but pattern is intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is sensorily dense yet controlled; rhythms breathe with scene arc. No significant loops, though “blushing stillness” recurrence leans close to template refrain. Imagery rarely muddles (exception: vines “tightening like fingers” is mixed but brief). Clean technical execution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: insect histories + cartographer logic = quiet monument without stone. Risk taken by letting plot surrender to atmospheric accretion rather than action; payoff sustains resonance. Familiar tropes (monarch pilgrimage, ethereal sanctuary) are textured, not transplanted. Concept feels singular despite gentle premise.</comment>
