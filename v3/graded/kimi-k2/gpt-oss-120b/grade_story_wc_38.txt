<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Selene’s interiority is vivid—her braid singing, her dance encoding weakness—but the “calm defiance” trait is asserted more than embodied in contradictory micro-choices; the final sealing of the crystal feels pre-ordained rather than wrested from genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lab’s rise and Selene’s exit reconfigure stakes with felt cost (she leaves the dice behind). Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each journal shimmer tightens the pattern until the crystal’s pulse syncs with hers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken lab’s pressure, rusted steel, and kelp-bound journal are tactile and constraining; the hangman’s dice physically respond to Selene’s song, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; tide and coral tiles track.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—encode vulnerability as strength—escalates through each coded entry and dance, tightening until the dice unlock the crystal. Cost is visible: Selene relinquishes the dice and the lab itself. One clear deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: fragility transmuted into resilient code. The final image of the lab ascending while the dice remain below offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer—vulnerability archived, defiance enacted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical, consistent third-person intimate voice; perceptual signature filters every detail through Selene’s synesthetic braid and breath-timed dance. Syntax modulates with pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; occasional stacked metaphors (“spider spins its web,” “phoenix,” “old song hummed”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no loops or scaffolds in closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: cryptographic dance in a drowned lab, hangman’s dice as silent oracles. Risky lyricism pays off; premise is specific enough that swapping elements would break the spell. Minor deduction for familiar phoenix image.</comment>
