<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is specific—her “quietly deliberate” trait is embodied in the tactile tracing of glyphs and the pause to listen for the key’s tick. Motivation (shadow riddle) is rooted in childhood and intensifies through the ritual. The final choice to seal the awakenings costs her the next mystery, giving earned stasis. Minor: no contradictory impulse shown mid-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the luminous chamber map reweights the premise, and the cost is the key winding down—future awakenings now closed to her. Causal chain holds: relearning loops → glyph spiral → doorway → chamber. Orientation anchored by line 3. One micro-turn suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory is filtered through Lira’s selective attention—copper plates, telescope lens, stone arch—each constraining her ritual movements. Micro-setting (key, glyphs, chamber walls) directly shapes the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile and auditory over visual, matching urgency. No spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—map the noon shadows—is signaled early and tightened when the doorway appears, foreclosing other research paths. Agency drives escalation: each traced loop narrows options until the final sealing. Cost is the key’s dormancy. No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical knowledge and sacrifice emerges from the act of closing loops; no explicit statement. The luminous chamber reprises the childhood riddle, reweighting “shadows” from absence to migratory entities. Final image invites reflection without moralizing. Subtext carried in the key’s soft chime and winding down.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control—“quietly deliberate” cadence mirrors the ritual. Perceptual signature is scholarly-tactile: “amber glyphs,” “faint tick,” “scent of old parchment.” No dialogue; internal texture remains consistent. Compression and elision taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory, emotional, and conceptual work. No loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“time folded back on itself”) are coherent within fantasy physics. Occasional elevated diction fits scholar POV. Final third clean of artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: spoon-bent reality + rune loops + shadow migration feels inevitable in hindsight. Clockwork key and sealed awakenings are tropes transformed through tactile ritual. Risky lyric structure holds under causal lens. Specificity anchors universals; no derivative echoes.</comment>
