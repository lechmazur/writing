<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena’s interiority is vivid—her “nested awakening” and brush-tap choices embody the shift from certainty to curiosity—but the cost feels more conceptual than visceral; the final smile is earned yet lightly felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each reflected sound layer deepens stakes until the garden’s heartbeat mirrors hers, achieving Charged Poise with clear before/after reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden is not mere backdrop; its harmonic currents and marble arches actively shape Lena’s choices and the final auroral murals, constraining and charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trading certainty for curiosity—tightens through escalating sensory pressure; the final ripple of murals crystallizes the cost without external coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Lena’s tactile choices; the garden’s question reframes her vocation without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric, painterly voice remains consistent; selective sensory detail and rhythmic compression teach the pattern early and pay off in the final auroral cascade.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“cascade of miniature auroras”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum or cloud closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthetic sound-garden and numismatic magic; the hobo nickel’s auroral etching feels inevitable yet wholly new, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
