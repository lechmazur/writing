<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lir’s sensory gift and mission are clear, but interiority drifts toward lyrical abstraction (“taste of remorse…bright citrus”) rather than embodied contradiction; the final act of tasting/removing grief is dramatized yet the cost feels diffuse because no prior flaw or fear is tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the coral cracks, remorse dissolves, and the fortress’s stance shifts from brittle to resilient. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory beat layers density until the final cadence shift. Cost is felt in the widening cracks and the chef’s chill, but causality between tasting and structural release could be tighter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Desert-fortress, rain-slick stone, and coral ice are vivid and selective; the coral arch physically constrains the final gesture and reappears charged. Micro-setting (stone walls weeping brine) mirrors internal stakes. Spatial choreography remains coherent; only minor drift into ornamental lyricism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—alleviating collective remorse—is signaled early and escalates through tactile contagion. One meaningful tightening: the act of tasting/subsuming grief narrows options to release or fracture. Cost is visible (cracking coral, dissipating storm) but pressure plateaus rather than spikes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-flavor emerges organically; no explicit moralizing. Final image of “sweet promise of memory he could now season” offers quiet conceptual repricing. Subtext in coral’s sigh and salt-sweet taste deepens reflection without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Lir’s palate and skin; perceptual signature is consistent, rhythmic, and sensory-dense. Occasional elevated diction (“crystallized over generations”) edges toward register drift but remains within lyrical tolerances. No head-hopping or filter clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush yet mostly propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“bitter as burnt cumin…bright citrus”) risk overwriting but pattern is taught early. Rhythm modulates with pressure. Minor synonym loops (“cold…chill…icy”) and one paraphrase loop near midpoint; none touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Memory-tasting chef healing communal guilt through coral-ice alchemy is fresh synthesis. Tropes (desert mystic, empathic healer) are refigured via culinary metaphor and tidal-pool cartography. Specificity of “sandpaper rough memories” and coral cracking gives the concept durable bite.</comment>
