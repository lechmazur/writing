<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority stays concrete—“rubble of his past failures pulse like heartbeats”—and the memory-for-silk barter externalizes flaw. Yet the “meek” trait is asserted, not shown contradicting bold descent; no micro-choice under pressure reveals fresh contradiction before the silk is simply granted. Closure earns credible endurance, but the arc rides summary more than scene, capping depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: rumor → map → mine → glyph test → silk → forge → crystal vines, each step a because/therefore. Barter cost is legible on-page (“offered the memory…stone answered”). Orientation anchors by line 5; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening suffices; closure lands Earned Stasis with visible price, satisfying lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Violet dawns, sapphire fruit, copper grove—selective, sensory, filtered through blacksmith’s goal. Floating arches later cast shadows that “dance like specters,” mirroring internal shift. Mine glyphs glow azure, constraining passage; forge beneath arch echoes hammer, charging final image. Environment directly shapes tactics and closure, meeting 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“coax resilience from rubble”—signaled early; pressure tightens when memory barter is accepted, foreclosing retreat. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visible (lost forge memory), but secondary stakes (villagers’ reaction) remain abstract, keeping escalation just shy of higher band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of “bartered awakenings” emerges through image—crystal vines knitting broken ground—never sermonized. Final blade-song reweights earlier fruit-hum, offering non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers: is forgetting failure true resilience? Avoids tidy moral; only a faint echo of prompt-like phrasing in penultimate line tempers score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight; perceptual signature favors metallic, sonic detail—“forge humming with azure defiance.” Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for descent, clipped strikes at forge. No head-hop; diction remains within blacksmith’s lexicon. One lyrical lapse—“twin horizon of hope and doubt”—leans abstract, not enough to break voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary in length and opening; strong verbs carry motion. Occasional modifier clusters (“quietly determined, each strike a promise he could not yet name”) but never obscure causality. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. High information density; final image crystallizes without overwriting. Minor filter verbs tolerated under lyric mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Silk-for-memory barter refreshes the “magic item quest” trope; crystal vines regrowing stone invert ruin-to-resource, feeling specific to this orchard planet. Synthesis of forge-craft and planetary heartbeat is fresh, not checklist. Risk is moderate—lyric ascent, no twist—but execution coherent. Could swap planet name without breaking arc, keeping score sub-9.</comment>
