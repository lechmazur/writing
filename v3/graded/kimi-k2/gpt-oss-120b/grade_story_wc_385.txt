<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lush and embodied; the singer’s contradictory impulses—yearning to free the echoes yet fearing their cost—surface in the cavern beat. Motivation remains consistent and intensifies toward the final choice to merge the shells. The only gap: the “richly perceptive” trait is asserted rather than tested in scene, keeping it from 8.8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the conjoined shells sing the universe’s hymn, reweighting the premise that echoes are living memories. Cost is felt in the singer’s “quiet ache” and her promise to carry the burden outward. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each echo layer deepens pattern until the lattice crystallizes. Minor drift: orientation is lyrically delayed but taught by the spiral path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Serpentine nexus, starlight, and cavern are rendered with tactile specificity; the shell’s glow and quartz light constrain the final ritual. Micro-setting (the stone altar) becomes the pivot point. A hairline slip: canyon geography is more atmospheric than obstacle, capping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—why people echo—tightens through progressive disclosure; each revealed memory raises the cost of silence. The final merging of shells forecloses the option to leave the echoes unrestored. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens, but the external stakes remain largely internalized, keeping it shy of 8.8.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: echoes as unfinished stories yearning for witness. The final hymn offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the shell’s glow and lattice threads deepens the idea. One soft line—“she felt a peace as gentle as a reed’s sigh”—leans toward summary, preventing 9.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every image through the singer’s synesthetic ear. Syntax modulates with emotional swell—long coils for wonder, clipped fragments for ache. No head-hopping or register drift. A single near-cliché (“winter wind”) keeps it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; metaphor chains (reed, tide, lattice) are purposeful and paid off. Rhythm breathes with scene needs. One looped phrase—“reed-blown melancholy” repeated—triggers a −0.2 artifact, capping at 8.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Fresh synthesis: seashell acoustics as mnemonic archaeology. The cosmic-lyric frame feels inevitable, not gimmicky. Risk in the mythic register is fully committed and earned. Only the faintest echo of familiar “unfinished business” tropes holds it from 9.5.</comment>
