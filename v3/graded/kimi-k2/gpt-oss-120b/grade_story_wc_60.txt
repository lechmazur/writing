<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s luminous skepticism is embodied in her cautious tracing of symbols and the moment she “inhaled the hush,” yet her interior contradiction—doubt versus the act of belief in the ritual—stays more asserted than dramatized. The final smile and pledge of guardianship register as earned renunciation with visible cost, but earlier beats lean on abstract resolve rather than micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the constellation of liberated memories reweights the city’s silence into song, with Mara’s empty box as felt cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each breadcrumb adds density until the pause of geese crystallizes the moment—though the geese’s exact mechanics are lightly taught rather than rigorously foreshadowed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The cracked fountains and violet dusk are vivid, selective, and filtered through Mara’s gaze; the empty basin’s ripple becomes the micro-setting that constrains her final twist of the box. Spatial choreography is coherent, and sensory hierarchy narrows under urgency, but the city never quite exerts active resistance that would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberation of trapped memories—is signaled early and tightened once when the box’s hinges resist; the cost is the surrender of her burden and the city’s reclaimed voice. Escalation is a single deepening rather than multiple reversals, sufficient for the length, though pressure feels more atmospheric than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-constellation emerges organically from the spilled lights; no explicit moralizing intrudes. The final image reframes skepticism as stewardship, offering resonant ambiguity without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“defiant hush,” “sidereal patience”) that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature is distinct—Mara notices lantern refractions and petrichor with a skeptic’s precision—and no POV leakage occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical, but figurative layering occasionally stacks (“kaleidoscopic prayers,” “river of forgotten lullabies”) without pattern payoff. No loops or scaffold, and sentence rhythm breathes with scene needs; minor overwriting in mid-section keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of migrating geese as temporal key, stained-glass box as memory prison, and fountains as mnemonic vessels feels inevitable yet fresh. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; no derivative echoes detected.</comment>
