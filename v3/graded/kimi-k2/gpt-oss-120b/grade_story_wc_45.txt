<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bone-setting metaphor channels interiority; "tingled at the prospect" merges skepticism with tactile memory. Shifts from past wrist repair to present spine repair show earned skill evolving. Renunciation in the final paragraph—that she keeps the tooth rather than use it—crystallizes contradiction: belief purchased by self-limitation. Only the "shrewdly innocent" tag feels ornamental.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is the garden’s exhale and the redrawn star maps; the baby tooth reconfigures both body and worldview in a singular earned stasis. Causal links remain intact: discovery → alignment → renunciation of further use. Garden breath image charges the final beat without abstract explanation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The midnight garden breathes perfume and memory simultaneously. Micro-spatial anchoring—“cradled in moss”, “kneel beside the corpse”—makes the body the intimate setting that charges final choice. One minor slip: “vines seemed to align” edges toward cliché symbol rather than spatial constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens as possibility of reintegration shrinks to one usable object; every paragraph after midpoint narrows to handling the tooth and spine. One visible cost—the renunciation to keep the tooth rather than risk its full power—lands in the final beat. Pressure is coherent without reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme emerges through tactile restoration and celestial cataloguing rather than declaration. The phrase “Mistakes are not failures; they are the dark matter that binds the universe together” risks overt thematizing but lands as CR re-rating after embodied events.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Cadenced free indirect style sustains lyric pressure without dropping reader orientation: “She whispered to the roots” performs both character intimacy and garden agency. Minimal dialogue is purposeful, so Q6 penalty not triggered. Occasional “shrewdly innocent” feels like repeated phrasal glue rather than rhythm need, a minor artifact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Syntactic layering creates density: “The baby tooth glowed brighter, its light spreading through the roots like an embryonic galaxy” holds three layers—object, verb, metaphor—in one breath. Few scaffold sentences; only “a literal cleft echoing her inner doubt” leans close to redundant exposition but serves orientation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Fusion of bone-setting cosmology with mythic tooth-lattice feels inevitable only here; any other setting or profession would collapse the stakes and final image. Low risk penalty waiver: the combination succeeds through specificity rather than novelty for its own sake.</comment>
