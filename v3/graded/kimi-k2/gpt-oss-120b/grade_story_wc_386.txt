<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; motives (“expose hidden purity”) stay stated rather than embodied in micro-choices. No contradictory impulses are dramatized on the page; the whisperer’s final resolve feels foregone rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a lyric Resonant Reconfiguration: the globe brightens, the window solidifies, and the whisperer departs with starlight “in her veins.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of dream fragments reweights meaning. Cost is implied but not rendered on the page, keeping it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Glacier shrine, lantern, melted globe, and borrowed starlight are vivid and selective. The shrine’s ice walls and candlelight constrain the ritual space, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the globe as liquid mirror) functions as setting-in-miniature that guides the climactic touch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—salvage purity from wreckage—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: dream fragments accumulate until the lattice forms. No tightening choice narrows options; the whisperer’s agency is observational until the final whisper, which lacks visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal healing through shared fragments emerges implicitly via dream lattice. Final image of sunrise illuminating “countless other shattered dreams” offers non-literal resonance. Avoids overt moralizing, though abstraction blunts emotional specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific (“cold melt into her skin like a promise”). Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off. No dialogue; free-indirect texture holds. Occasional elevated diction (“choir of quiet light”) risks register drift but remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical, with rhythmic variation and high information density. Metaphors occasionally layer (“lattice of connections,” “dream-tide”) without muddle. No loops or scaffold. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt”) in peak beat but not disruptive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes ghost-whispering, dream cartography, and glacial ritual into a fresh configuration. Risky lyric mode commits fully; transformation test passes—story would collapse without dream-globe lattice. Avoids derivative beats, though concept remains familiar at core.</comment>
