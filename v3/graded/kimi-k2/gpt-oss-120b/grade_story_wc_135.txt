<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Archivist’s interiority is evocative yet abstract; motives (“compile fragments into meaning”) are stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices. No contradictory impulses surface in-scene; the exile backstory is ornamental. The final communal act is earned but the cost feels diffuse, not personally paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—communal chorus crystallizes—but cost is collective, not focal. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and held. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks, yet the tightening beat is soft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ivory harbor, rain-slick piers, and brass valve are vividly rendered and constrain action (valve as repository, harbor as listening space). Sensory hierarchy aligns with archivist’s priorities; setting subtly guides the gathering ritual. Final image recharges the harbor’s silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring communal memory—is signaled early. Pressure deepens through accumulation of fragments, but no single beat narrows options or exacts a visible personal price. Escalation is textural, not causal; closure is communal rather than individual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-tide emerges through image and ritual, never stated. Subtext resides in silences and absences. Final chord invites readers to co-author meaning, achieving resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, salt-stained, and consistent; perceptual signature (reactively visionary) colors every observation. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Syntax and diction serve atmospheric pressure; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet fluid; metaphors (“shattered glass,” “missing stanza”) serve rather than stall. Minor loop risk in repeated wave/echo phrasing, but rhythm modulates with scene needs. No clarity loss at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Transforms familiar “lone archivist” trope into communal memory-keeper; brass valve repurposed from herald to archive is fresh. Specificity of salt-stained wool, coral maps, and staggered intervals feels lived-in rather than ornamental.</comment>
