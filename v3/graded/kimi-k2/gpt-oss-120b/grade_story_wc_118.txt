<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is textured—ash on coat, trembling page—but the historian’s choices remain observational; no contradictory impulse forces a costly decision. The final “gently shifted” axis is accepted rather than contested, so the closure lacks visible personal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of diary fragments + tapestry vibrations tighten toward resonant reconfiguration. Closure—the silo’s “living pulse” and axis realignment—is legible and charged, though cost is more conceptual than personal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Rusted silo skin, oak cradle, bronze lamp light are selective and tactile; the vaulted chamber’s glyphs physically constrain the historian’s placement of the tapestry, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—recovering the world’s displaced axis—escalates through humming walls and vibrating stone; each discovery narrows options toward the chamber descent. Cost is atmospheric rather than personal, but pressure remains coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory as living architecture emerges through diary ash, dragon scales, and the silo’s breathing shelves. Final image of “stories walls have heard” reweights the premise without moralizing, leaving resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific—“bronze quiet rhythm,” “metallic taste of age.” No dialogue, but free-indirect texture and rhythmic control under pressure create a singular auditory signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language (“grain spun like a compass rose”) is purposeful and never muddled. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or knowledge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic archivist in a silo-library is familiar, yet the fusion of medieval tapestry, axis-shift cosmology, and memory-resonant architecture feels freshly synthesized. Risk lies in quiet lyricism rather than spectacle.</comment>
