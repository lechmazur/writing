<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Alder’s interiority is vivid—his “heart humming with tinkersong wonder” embodies motive—but the covenant’s lie-sensitivity is asserted rather than tested through his choices, so the final smile feels slightly unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the gear’s click reconfigures the town’s fate under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the amber lattice is a visible cost. Orientation is swift, causality holds, though the mayor’s warning about truth never meets an on-page lie.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The resonance chamber’s brass hum and rust-garden are tactile and atmospheric; the philosopher’s-stone chip glows like a micro-setting that constrains the repair. Fog and clocktower anchor place and mood without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—“light stolen by midnight”—is signaled early and tightened by the ticking tower; Alder’s agency drives the repair. Yet the cost is more luminous than visceral, keeping it just shy of the highest band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-maintenance emerges through the covenant’s rust and the lullaby of sunrise; the final image of lanterns powered by revived resonance offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“tinkersong wonder,” “garden of iron vines”—with consistent perceptual signature. Compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off in the closing melody.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense, but occasional stacked modifiers (“faint luminescence rose…threading silver threads”) flirt with overwriting; no loops or artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The covenant-of-rust premise, the mending-without-cutting ethic, and the philosopher’s-stone shard synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious fable; transformation test passes.</comment>
