<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid—her lineage’s fire memory pulses in every step—but the “gracefully alert” label never constrains a choice; the final renunciation is earned yet the cost is more asserted than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer tightens the pattern until the coin’s resonant tone reweights the premise; the closure beat (“the graft held…”) crystallizes options with felt communal cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon and black sand are not backdrop—they constrain footing, echo fire memory, and charge the final amber image; spatial choreography is exact, every grain accounted for.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—transform inherited fire into healing—is signaled early; pressure deepens through accumulating sensory density rather than causal reversals, culminating in a visible communal shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Theme of scars-as-song emerges through tactile particulars; the final image of migrating clouds carrying the tone offers resonant, non-moralizing closure that reweights all prior fire imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Lyric, controlled third-person hovers close to Mira’s pulse; diction is volcanic and marine by turns, rhythm breathes with tidal cadence, no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“liquid midnight,” “molten amber”) risk overwriting but serve the accumulative design and never stall momentum or cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: firefighter daughter of arsonist grafts literal fire-sand into a sonic healing ritual; the premise feels inevitable yet wholly new, risk taken without gimmickry.</comment>
