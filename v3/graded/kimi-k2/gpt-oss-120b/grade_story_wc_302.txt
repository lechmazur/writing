<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Interiority remains abstract; “cautious exuberance” repeats without embodiment. The veiled dreamer acts but her choices lack contradiction or visible cost. No micro-choice in the climax—reaching for the petal is too smooth to register as character under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the map is alive—but the cost is only asserted, not dramatized. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early yet escalation feels ornamental rather than tightening. Orientation holds, but causality between reversed glyphs and final gate remains fuzzy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Library breathes, glyphs float, petals hum—vivid, selective, and thematically coherent. However, the setting constrains choice only once (silver latch) and the final garden is more tableau than tactical space. Micro-setting (watch) is handled well.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the unspoken library—is clear, but pressure plateaus after the alcove opens. Reversals are decorative (glyphs spin) rather than narrowing options. No visible price paid; the cost is poetic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of language as living cipher emerges through imagery, not statement. Final image reweights earlier motifs (petals = unspoken words) with quiet resonance. Avoids moralizing, though subtext stays cerebral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and textured; perceptual signature (“dust halos danced like murmurs”) is distinctive. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and sustained. No dialogue, so no register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; occasional stacked metaphors (“luminous petals…choir of silent letters”) flirt with excess but do not obscure. Rhythm modulates with scene needs. One paraphrase loop (“cyclically reversed” x3) slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Premise—library of unspoken words decoded by time-reversed gears—is fresh and executed with conceptual integrity. Risky lyric structure pays off in final image. Avoids cliché, though echoes of Borges and Calvino are audible.</comment>
