<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Selene’s interiority is vivid—her “meteor hush” and reversed radar dishes mirror her ethical struggle—but the final reversal of narrative power is asserted more than dramatized; we see the insight, not the cost enacted. The serenity trait is embodied in calm micro-choices yet never truly tested under pressure, so the renunciation feels lightly earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Selene’s decision to invert storyteller/subject roles is legible and carries conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned imagery of reversal and half-light tightens until the final darkness—but the causality between campfire stick glow and epiphany is more associative than driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dome’s inward-facing dishes and ember-lit concrete create a tactile, mirrored crucible that literally reflects Selene’s ethical turn; the setting constrains staging choices and charges the final image of breathing darkness. Sensory detail is selective—pine scent, cracked concrete, distant circuitry—filtered through her calligrapher’s precision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether stories can be told without exploitation—surfaces early and tightens once when Selene reimagines puppet strings as lifelines. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the pressure deepens but never truly threatens her, so escalation feels cerebral rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the reversal motif: ethical storytelling as relinquishing control. The half-lit epiphany motif reweights from tool of manipulation to gift of autonomy without moralizing. Subtext in the meteor hush and reversed dishes resonates without explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a calligrapher’s tactile diction—“ink into questions,” “ribbons of starlight”—and rhythmic control that modulates with the ember’s pulse. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the final darkness. No POV drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is disciplined, each image advances atmosphere or theme. Occasional elevated phrasing (“ethical wonder,” “conceptual repricing”) edges toward abstraction but never stalls momentum. Clean grammar, no loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The premise—reversing narrative power inside a rusted radar dome—feels fresh, synthesizing puppet theatre, calligraphy, and Cold-War relic into a coherent ethical inquiry. Specificity of the inward dishes and campfire stick grounds the concept; risk lies in cerebral rather than visceral stakes.</comment>
