<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative ("familiar wound") and the paradoxical "prudently adventurous" trait is dramatized when the explorer chooses to enter the narrowing corridor. The final renunciation—using the key as a guide for others rather than hoarding it—earns its cost. Yet the shift from claustrophobic dread to cosmic acceptance feels compressed; more embodied struggle in the passage would raise the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each spatial shift layers pressure until the garden’s glow reconfigures meaning. Closure lands cleanly with Conceptual Repricing—the key reframed as communal compass. One minor causality hiccup: the organ’s mechanics are asserted rather than shown to trigger the spatial mutiny.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The cavern’s "yawning" throat and the altar’s constellated window anchor space early; the compass’s shifting lines physically constrain movement. The final garden of luminescent fungi recharges the organ’s resonance, tying setting to closure. A hairline slip: the starlit exit feels less claustrophobic than promised, muting the thematic echo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—recovering the key—tightens when the walls literally narrow choice. Spatial mutiny escalates via the compass’s activation, forcing a trade-off between personal relief and legacy. Cost is visible: the explorer’s claustrophobia never fully abates, lingering as earned stasis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges implicitly: stories against forgetting, space as memory. The crystalline key’s redefinition from weapon to guide offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext hums in the organ’s lingering chord—music as architecture of remembrance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise: "stone and shadow betray their fixed positions" marries concept to texture. POV stays locked in the explorer’s heightened sensorium; no head-hop. Compression like "heart beat prudently adventurous" teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final garden.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; metaphor rarely overruns sense. One scaffold loop—"walls quivered...space itself seemed to sigh"—dulls the spatial mutiny beat. Otherwise, cadence modulates with pressure, and the final line lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The fusion of church-organ acoustics with tectonic rebellion feels fresh; the compass as cartographic key is a non-obvious synthesis. Risk lies in the compressed emotional arc, but specificity of the glowing fungi garden saves it from abstraction.</comment>
