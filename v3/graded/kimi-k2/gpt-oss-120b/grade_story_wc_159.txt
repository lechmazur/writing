<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority blooms in concrete micro-choices—aligning the chime, sealing the vial—yet emotion flirts with lyric cliché (“foxglove regret,” “violet sorrow”). Motivation to resurrect names is coherent; the final gift of a glass orchid crystallizes purpose. Secondary pressure is absent; traveler merely receives. Cost registers softly in returned foxglove regret, but agency stays interior and serene rather than pressured to a crucible point.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Charged Poise: caretaker refills candle and whispers anew, an Earned Stasis that forecloses closure and cycles loss forever. Causal lattice is delicate—because wind passes, therefore name-resonance is caught and stored—but the logic is legible under Accumulative lens. No gaps, prop amnesia, or retroactive patch. Time and place anchor early and stay stable across repetitive ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Opal library is rendered in luminous, purpose-filtered detail—light caught in glass orchids, narrow windows above clouds—yet it never constrains a single choice in the current ritual. Micro-setting (bamboo crack, candle wick) constrains handling and timing, raising the score. Sensory selectivity heightens, but scale remains decorative backdrop rather than tactical leverage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—“keep the fading names alive”—is clear, but escalation is iterative ritual, not mounting pressure; each night resets rather than narrows. Wind is passive antagonist, visitor merely corroborates hope. A visible, felt cost arrives only via soft melancholy and nightly repetition; no live resource dwindles. One tightening shift (traveler receives orchid, cycle continues) reconfigures without real cost escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question>
<comment>Theme—memory as sacred labor, loss as renewable bloom—emerges from ritual and tactile objects, never sermonized. Recycled image of orchids and candlelight acquires new weight in traveler’s scent of “forgotten rain.” Final reprise is resonant rather than moral. Ambiguity is preserved: the cycle is endless, hope and burden interknit. No thematic clutter or prompt‐echo lines detected.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Voice stays consistent, lyrically compressed, yet precise: “petal catching glow,” “systematic shuffle,” “bamboo tubes sang in fractured harmony.” POV is steady first-person intimate. Distinct perceptual signature leans poetic without vagueness. No dialogue to evaluate. Compression sometimes verges on pattern cadence, but pattern is taught early and echoed to closure, earning indulgence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</question>
<comment>Prose is sensuous and rhythmic, free of major artifacts. Occasional stacked modifiers (“shimmering with the recorded names”) risk redundancy but never obscure cause. Sentence openings and paragraph lengths vary naturally; no loops, paraphrase chains, or filter-verb plague. Minor lyric excesses stay beneath the closure-interference threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Glass-orchid memory-museum premise is fresh, fuses tangible gardening with abstract archaeology of emotions. Ritual cycle, wind chime re-purposed as name-recorder, and candlelit archive avoid formula. Integration is cohesive; nothing feels grafted. Only slight dilution comes from familiar poetic “restoring lost names” arc, offset by tactile specificity of orchid petals and sealed vials.</comment>
