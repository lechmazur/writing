<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s stoic sensitivity is embodied in the trembling hand that still writes; the contradiction is present but not fully exploited. Her vow to return supplies a credible renunciation with felt cost, yet the interior stakes remain more asserted than dramatized. The inkwell-as-relic is a strong characterizing prop, but its agency is ornamental until the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure arrives as Earned Stasis: Mara’s promise to return seals the pavilion’s memory and forecloses immediate rest. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each note layers density until the final amber glow reweights the whole. Cost is visible in the “quiet fire” of ink bleeding onto vellum. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is rendered through cold water, algae scent, and marble “skeletal fingers,” anchoring action and choice. The inkwell’s brass glint reflected in moonlight charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Selective sensory detail mirrors Mara’s narrowed, professional focus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving drowned memory—tightens through each placed note; the final vow is the decisive narrowing. Pressure is textural, not causal, but coherent under the Accumulative lens. One credible loss: the ink itself bleeds away, altering later tactics. No reversals, yet the deepening is sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus oblivion emerges from the concrete act of inscribing absence; no explicit moralizing. The interlaced absence motif shifts from architectural description to existential weight in the final image. Subtext operates in the ink’s “quiet fire” sealing silence. Complexity lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that accelerates during the wade and slows at the vow. Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices what a surveyor would, filtered through restrained emotion. No head-hopping; tense and psychic distance remain stable. Occasional elevated diction (“interlaced absence”) risks register drift but stays within poetic license.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Mixed metaphors (“cloak of flame,” “wet parchment”) occasionally clash but never obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. One filter-verb cluster (“she felt”) in the climax slightly dulls immediacy but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—an archaeologist of abandoned dreams armed with an inkwell—feels fresh, synthesizing ruin-porn tropes into intimate ritual. Specificity of the marble pavilion and brass inkwell prevents generic drift. The final reprise of the inkwell’s glow in moonlight is a non-obvious reconfiguration. Risk is present but controlled; no gimmickry.</comment>
