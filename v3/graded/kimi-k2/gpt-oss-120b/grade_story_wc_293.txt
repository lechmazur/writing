<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Fiddler is more emblem than person; interiority glimmers when he notices the wind as “inscribed letters” but remains mostly label-driven. No visible internal contradiction or mistake. Ending shift feels symbolic rather than earned by prior choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on plate – “pixellated amnesty flickered” – with felt disbelief, satisfying the lens (accumulative/lyric tension re-weighting). Orientation clean by paragraph 3. Slight slack in mid-section when scaffold map is introduced via exposition, not causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Mountain pullout becomes micro-setting instrument: pine needles filter sunrise onto the glass, constraining exposure time. Sensory hierarchy shifts under urgency (“sky split open, amber light”). No generic postcards; granite glow at closure feels specific and charged.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake – deliver bridge-song to activate amnesty – is signalled early and intensifies toward summit. One decisive tightening: glass-flake trembles to capture the moment. Cost visible (exposure, literal light), yet escalation feels gentle for publish-now tier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of redemptive memory emerges through recurrence of “map” and “amnesty”; not stated outright. Final image reweights prior sins via pixel pardon. Slight drift into thematic echo (“hope can be observed dynamically”).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Voiced lyric cadence without head-hop; wind-ink metaphor taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature unique – violin as compass, pine as parchment. Rhythm accelerates on ridge under bow-stroke sentences. Filter verbs minimal, no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose sings: “granite face glowing with pixelated glow” – vivid, concrete, internally consistent. No loops, density high. Occasional decorative flourish (e.g., “thread of sunrise”) does not obscure clarity. Read-aloud ear strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh angle fuses wet-plate photography and pixel forgiveness; trope of hitchhiker redemption reframed through glass chemistry. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. No clichés recycled. Risk – lyre vs lens – pays off without gimmick.</comment>
