<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aria’s “chaotically precise” mind is dramatized through embodied micro-choices—aligning shards, whispering equations, steadying her palm—each revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure. The interior contradiction (logic vs wonder) is present but stays slightly abstract; the final renunciation (“must revive, not only record”) is earned yet stated more than dramatized. Cost is felt in the tremor and the risk of fracture, but the emotional price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the canyon becomes a living archive and Aria’s stance shifts from observer to reviver. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the final tableau fades, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. The only minor drag is a touch of explanatory summary just before the mirror projects its visions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Moonlit canyon, basalt column, and broken mirror are rendered with selective sensory economy; each constrains action (lab setup on basalt, shard alignment with fissures). The mirror-as-micro-setting charges the final image when it hums with stored dreams. A few phrases drift toward the picturesque (“liquid quartz”), but they don’t stall momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming archaeologist of abandoned dreams—is signaled early and tightened when Aria realizes she must revive, not merely catalog. The tremor provides a visible price and risk of fracture; escalation is one clear deepening rather than multiple reversals. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as living tissue, dreams as unfinished vessels awaiting resurrection. The mirror’s final projection reweights earlier images without moralizing. Subtext is carried in gesture and silence—Aria’s palm on pulsing glass speaks louder than exposition. A faint echo of sentimentality in “song unsung” is offset by the canyon’s low, indifferent hum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—helix-minded, circuitry-laced diction that modulates under pressure (“quaking reverie”). Compression and patterned elision (“synaptic plasticity” left partly mysterious) are taught early and paid off at closure. No POV leakage; perceptual signature is consistent. Rhythm breathes with scene needs, accelerating during tremor, slowing at dawn fade.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Occasional near-mixed metaphors (“liquid quartz moonlight”) flirt with overwriting but do not obscure causality. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance multiple jobs. Strong verbs anchor every clause.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>The fusion of neuroscience and geology—synaptic plasticity applied to mineral veins—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The broken periscope mirror repurposed as neural interface is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking (lyric science-fantasy) heightens stakes without gimmickry. No close echoes of familiar scenes.</comment>
