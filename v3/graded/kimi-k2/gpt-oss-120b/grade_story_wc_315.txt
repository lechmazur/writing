<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is embodied and specific; the seeker's tactile memory and silent promise to the fallen skyfarer anchor motivation. The final nod to the crew crystallizes earned endurance, though the emotional cost is more implied than viscerally staged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reinforced harness and radio crackle reconfigure trust with visible cost. Accumulative lens holds—each remembered knot and falling leaf tightens the pattern until the final “Hold fast” reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor is rendered through motion and touch; vines, moss-dulled metal, and misty ground constrain every choice. The parachute buckle functions as micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving trust under pressure—escalates via tactile revision of the harness; the tightening of each loop narrows options until the radio’s single phrase crystallizes the cost. One decisive intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship and inherited duty emerges through the buckle’s reprise and the silent gratitude of the crew. Final image of the seeker vanishing into dawn offers resonant, non-moralizing closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language serves pattern rather than ornament. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction stays within the seeker’s reverent register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar survival-repair arc is transformed by arboreal sky setting and silent communion via radio static. The parachute buckle’s reprise feels inevitable yet fresh, charging the final ascent with inherited duty.</comment>
