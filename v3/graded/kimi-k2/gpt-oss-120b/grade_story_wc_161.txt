<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lila’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“balanced the weight of her past”), but the arc leans on summary rather than scene-level contradiction; the final stance crystallizes with felt cost yet lacks a decisive on-page micro-choice that rewrites her next move.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the attic breathes, the map glows, the songs travel. Causality is lyrical (Accumulative/Textural lens), but the tightening is legible—dust spirals → pigeon routes → city chorus. No orientation debt; transitions are taught by pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Attic skylight, dust motes, and meteorite chip form a micro-setting that constrains every choice; the single beam of light literally guides mapping and pigeon release. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“preserve the echo of lost songs”—is signaled early and escalates through each flight; the cost is the slivering of the meteorite and the irreversible dispersal of its song. One meaningful deepening: from attic isolation to city-wide chorus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: memory is not erased but layered like moss on stone. The meteorite’s lullaby and the paper trails reweight each other without moralizing; final image of the glowing map offers non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature is consistent (“slow, luminous whirl”). Patterned repetition of “paper trails” and “dust spirals” is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with ritual cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor scaffold in “each tiny vortex became a paper trail” echoed twice, but no loops touch the closure beat. Strong sentence variety and tactile verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of courier pigeons, Mars meteorite, and dust-map divination feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through Lila’s idiosyncratic ritual; risk in lyric structure heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
