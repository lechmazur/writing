<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her pulse against the vine, the “copper-capped finger”—but her contradictory impulses (tinkerer vs guardian) are stated rather than dramatized in scene. The final vow lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost (pollen sealing her shoulders), yet the shift from curiosity to custodian feels slightly smoothed rather than struggled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the moon’s gold re-weights the valley’s covenant and Mara’s role. Causal chain holds—lyre song → vine unfurl → pollen vow—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. One minor ellipsis: how the lyre’s “forgotten songs” were learned is elided, but the gap does not rupture the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Verdant arbor, stone altar, and moonlit canopy are rendered with selective sensory density; the vine itself becomes micro-setting that constrains Mara’s posture and choice. The golden pollen settling on her shoulders charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. A few phrases (“thick with dew,” “faint scent of pine”) edge toward stock but are brief.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore sacred rites—tightens once when the moon’s ascent forces Mara to weave counter-melody under live pressure. Cost is visible: she kneels, accepts lifelong guardianship. Escalation is single but sufficient; no reversals, yet the narrowing of options is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-remedy emerges organically from the vine’s song and the pollen’s vow; no explicit moralizing. The final image of “pages of an ancient book turning” offers a non-literal, resonant answer. Subtext in the lyre’s salvaged history deepens the theme without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter; diction tilts lyrical yet remains consistent (“sunbeams through the canopy”). Rhythm modulates with tension—long sentences for dawn hush, clipped phrases at moonrise. No dialogue, so voice cohesion is judged solely on narrative texture, which is controlled and distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; only two adjacent sentences restate the same content (“golden threads…golden stories”). Metaphors are coherent and scene-driven. One register drift—“celestial beacon”—feels slightly elevated for Mara’s tinkerer lexicon, but it is isolated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Familiar folkloric frame is refreshed by the tinkerer-technologist persona and the lyre-as-interface conceit. The synthesis of craft and ritual feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate; no structural gimmicks, but the specificity of the pollen-sealed vow lifts it above template.</comment>
