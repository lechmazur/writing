<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The alchemist’s interiority is vivid—his refusal of the bottle’s “soothing lies” is embodied in the pulse of recollection he uses to open it. Motivation (revive via memory) is consistent, but the arc is more emblematic than conflicted; no contradictory impulse complicates the final choice. Micro-choices (questioning the bottle, letting the sigh settle) reveal values, yet the cost feels diffuse—an earned stasis rather than a wound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the town lights “like constellations” under the alchemist’s memory-construction, a visible before/after. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each recalled detail layers density until the final bloom. Causality is lyric rather than stepwise, but the bottle’s sigh and lantern reprise tether the ending to the opening image. Cost is conceptual (perpetual caretaking) and legible in the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting is selective and atmospheric: paper-lantern cove, bruised sky, boarded windows. Sensory hierarchy favors light and texture, filtered through the alchemist’s memory-gaze. The lanterns evolve from flickering thoughts to floating streetlights, constraining the final image. Spatial anchors are clear; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—revive the town via memory—is signaled early. Pressure escalates through accumulating recollection; each remembered name/song tightens the weave. The tightening is a deepening, not a reversal, but the cost (lifelong vigilance) is felt. Agency is interior; no external antagonist needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as active creation versus passive nostalgia. Subtext lives in the bottle’s “sigh” and the lanterns’ migration from cove to rooftops. Final image reframes the past as renewable resource, not amber prison. No moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, controlled, and consistent—long sentences breathe during construction, then tighten at closure. Perceptual signature is the alchemist’s synesthetic memory-work (“each stone as a fragment of a story”). No dialogue; no POV drift. Compression (“he rejected false comfort”) is strategic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is textured yet clear; figurative language is sparse enough to avoid clutter. Rhythm modulates with scene needs. Occasional template cadence (“He imagined… He watched…”) but never in peak beats. No loops or mixed metaphors. High information density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise—reviving a ghost town by remembering it into being—is fresh and fully committed. Transformation of the amber bottle from sealed promise to emptied archive feels inevitable. Risky lyric structure pays off. No derivative echoes.</comment>
