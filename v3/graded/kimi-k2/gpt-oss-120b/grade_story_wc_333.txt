<comment>Clear interior longing anchors the locksmith’s actions, yet reliance on lyrical summary (“improbable longing”) weakens embodied contradiction under peak pressure. Embodied tremor in untying the lock is present, but epiphanies arrive through narration rather than dramatized internal split, limiting emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Causal chain holds: star-hint → ribbon groove → filament release → cosmos-charged exit. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis: locksmith leaves behind shorn lock, cost legible in permanent forfeiture of secret object, cosmos confirms idea’s lodging. Orientation anchors in starlight and shifting cobblestones taught early and pay off. </comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Shadowed nexus and shifting cobblestones supply spatial pressure, but micro-setting (locksmith’s boots, hair-glint) lacks tactile constraint on final choice. Atmosphere is evocative yet operates as backdrop rather than obstacle or final image charge. </comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—freeing the trapped idea—signals early and tightens once: ribbon slip forecloses return of hair. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but filament linger and cosmos acceptance keep pressure intact. One meaningful deepening suffices, escalation legible under Causal lens. </comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of courage bridging fear crystallizes in filament’s release, yet overt echo of “impossible longing” in final sentences dips toward thematic summary. Resonance emerges through specific act rather than abstract statement, hence above high bands. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Lyric POV remains anchored in locksmith perceptual bias throughout; rhythmic compression taught early and sustained. Filter verbs minimal; voice coherence intact, though elevated diction edges poetic declamation under stress. </comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Varied cadence, high density; minor synonym loops early (“echo”, “promise”) do not touch closure. Metaphor stack (“bridge between fear and courage”) is coherent and aligned to thematic closure. No line-level artifact that obscures final image. </comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Cosmic-keysmith premise feels freshly grounded: mundane ribbon + celestial filament fuse stakes. Risk of lyrical sentiment is controlled by tactile act (twist of ribbon). Near archetype yet individuated by singular scene logic, preventing stock fantasy. </question>
