<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation to decode leaves is clear and embodied in her seed-row rituals, but the interior contradiction—orderly mind vs. mystical surrender—remains asserted rather than dramatized in a single pressured choice. The final “mossy delight” transformation is vivid yet feels bestowed rather than earned through a visible cost or mistake. Micro-choices (prod, erect tower) align with motive but do not force a trade-off under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the luminous leaf-script reweights the grove into a living archive and Lira into its bridge. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each monument and moonstone beat layers density until the final cascade. The 120-word orientation is met; no teleporting props. Cost is felt in her irreversible bodily sync with the forest, though the price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is evoked with selective sensory strokes—ash-tinted canopy, moss scent, crystal pool reflection—filtered through Lira’s precise attention. The setting constrains choice: hidden spring location, leaf patterns, moonstone glow all guide her next prod and monument placement. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the forest’s message—is signaled early and tightens once when the first leaf ignites the dust, forcing Lira to seek the underground spring. Escalation is Accumulative: each monument and reading increases the grove’s claim on her. The cost is present (bodily transformation, irreversible sync) but could be more viscerally foregrounded.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of remembrance and reciprocal stewardship emerges from concrete acts—seed rows, twine towers, moonstone offerings—rather than statement. The final image of drifting moonstone mist reweights prior material into a living covenant. Subtext is carried in gesture and silence; no moralizing coda.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, mirroring Lira’s orderly mind encountering wonder. Syntax modulates from clipped seed-sorting cadences to longer incantatory lines as transformation deepens. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture, which holds steady. Occasional elevated diction (“mossy delight”) edges toward register drift but remains consistent with folkloric register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One paraphrase loop (“each seed was a letter, each sprout a word…”) is minor. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter. The final paragraph’s cadence matches the climactic release without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fusing arboriculture, cryptography, and quiet mysticism yields a fresh angle on the “forest speaks” trope. Specificity of moonstone dust vial and seed-row ciphers prevents generic drift. The transformation is inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at the outset. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over plot reversals—but coherence holds.</comment>
