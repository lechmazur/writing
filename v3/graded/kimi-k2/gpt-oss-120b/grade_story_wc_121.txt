<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid—"the world sigh beneath his weightless boots"—but the self-confrontation remains abstract; no embodied contradiction is dramatized. The final acceptance of "every version of himself" is asserted rather than earned through visible micro-choices. Motivation is thematically clear yet causally thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: tablet dissolves, timelines seal, he "fell upward"—a visible cost that reconfigures his stance. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of glowing/darkening brightness and tablet pulses tighten toward the final cadence. Orientation is immediate; causality is lyric rather than strict.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The viaduct’s phosphorescent rainwater and "darkening brightness" are woven through action, constraining each step and charging the final sunrise. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The tablet functions as micro-setting, its glow syncing with heartbeat to guide choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mastery of fractured selves—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via algorithmic corridors that foreclose options, culminating in the tablet’s dissolution as felt cost. Agency is present but the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Theme of embracing all timelines emerges through image and action; no moralizing. The final upward fall reweights earlier gravity-defiance without explicit statement. Subtext operates in the tablet’s hum and the viaduct’s glow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric, rhythmic, and consistent; perceptual signature distinct—"darkening brightness," "periodically eternal." No dialogue; internal monologue avoids filter verbs. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical; occasional stacked modifiers ("phosphorescent rainwater," "periodically eternal") risk overwriting but serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm mirrors the spiral structure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Gravity-defiance and timeline-fracturing are familiar tropes, but their synthesis through procedural self-mapping feels fresh. Specificity of tablet runes and viaduct glow prevents generic drift. Final image of upward fall transforms the trope.</comment>
