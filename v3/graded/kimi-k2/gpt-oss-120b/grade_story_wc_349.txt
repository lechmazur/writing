<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The vendor’s motive—“to find the place where stories begin”—is stated but never tested or contradicted; he performs the ritual flawlessly and exits unchanged. No interior contradiction or embodied cost surfaces; the child arrives too late to pressure him. The final smile feels unearned because the absence he measures never endangers or redefines him.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the vendor learns origin is a moment, not a place, and the library reconfigures around that idea. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of moonlight shards and reordered shelves reweights the stake. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. Yet the cost is abstract, legible only as “weight dissolved,” not felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The glass orchard library is vivid, tactile, and rule-consistent; shelves rearrange by absence, moonlight drips into letters spelling “origin.” These details constrain the vendor’s method and charge the final image. However, the setting never physically obstructs or endangers him, so stakes remain conceptual rather than environmental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—locating narrative origin—escalates only once: the vendor’s incision releases moonlight that awakens dormant scripts. Pressure is aesthetic, not perilous; no option is foreclosed, no price visibly paid. The child’s arrival extends rather than tightens the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: stories begin in quantified absence, silence made luminous. The final silver “origin” on the floor reweights earlier void-counting without moralizing. Yet the child’s instant acceptance blunts complexity, offering tidy rather than ambiguous resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually specific—“translucent bark humming,” “shy sunrise.” Patterned elision (e.g., “integrated fragmentation”) is taught early and paid off. No POV drift; the child’s single whisper fits the dream-logic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; metaphors rarely clash, rhythm modulates with scene pulse. Occasional density—“glimmering parole of creation”—skirts overwriting yet remains legible. No loops or scaffold; final chord lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The floating glass library, moonlight bottled as narrative seed, and origin-as-absence synthesize familiar motifs into a fresh, coherent vision. Risky lyric compression succeeds; nothing feels grafted or gimmicked. Only the vendor’s lack of personal stakes keeps it from full inevitability.</comment>
