<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is rich; chaplain’s contradictory mercy-vs-temptation pulses inside the repair beats. Embodied emotion sits in finger-tracing brass and heartbeat-sync hum, but the shopkeeper remains generic; secondary character pressure mild.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Acc/Textural lens holds throughout: accumulation of micro-repairs becomes prayer. Closure = Resonant Reconfiguration—steady pulse becomes literal and moral beat. Last paragraph crystallizes cost: “even in the stone-cold corridors” he will carry the song. Orientation clear within 100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Shop air “ticking gears” subtly constrains choice: each sound marks irreversible motion, mirrors heartbeat calibration. Fog and sun shafts reweight the moment of ignition. Object as micro-setting hits gate 9+ on constraining action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake = mercy worth the risk of mechanical soul-tamper. Each winding tightens until only “apology made action” remains. Price visible: chaplain forsakes neutrality—spring now beats inside his own ministry future.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</answer><comment>Theme emerges from the organ repair itself—redemption is engineering, not slogan. Final pulse reconfigures “second opinion” from diagnosis to co-creation. Resonates without sermon; ambiguity retained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Warm ecclesiastic cadence blends with workshop diction; “rhythm of redemption” phrase lands earned by preceding tactile beats. No POV drift; free indirect is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates from fog-bound slowness to urgent metronomic sentences as gears catch. Occasional “By the way light…” fragment is deliberate, legible. Zero loops; every sentence performs dual duty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Penitentiary × antique music-box pairing is unexpected yet plausible; the merger turns from quirky premise to moral engine. Minor freshness deduction: “beat of redemption” metaphor drifts close to familiar trope, lightly lowering originality.</comment>
