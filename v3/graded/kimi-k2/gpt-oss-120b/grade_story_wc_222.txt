<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lysander’s contradictory impulses—thief’s daring vs. apprentice’s reverence—surface in the tactile chess-swap ritual, but interiority drifts into lyrical summary (“soul expand like a sunrise”) rather than embodied contradiction under final pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spire’s thaw rewrites the ancient/unknown contract, cost felt in Lysander’s whispered perpetual obligation. Causal chain from sundial chime to final cascade is legible, though orientation drifts in the descent vignette.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Icebound spire and violet sky function as active antagonists—temperature softens with each secret released, sky’s wrongness tightens the temporal window. Micro-setting of brass lid constrains tactics in multiple beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—undo the frost-curse—tightens via each swapped chess piece; final queen-for-king exchange forecloses retreat and triggers the thaw. Cost is conceptual (eternal amendment duty) rather than visceral, but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge as living covenant emerges through the spire’s literal thaw; no overt moralizing. Final image of humming sundial inviting children keeps ambiguity—wonder as burden or gift—without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lush, rhythmic prose carries a consistent lyric-fantasy register; perceptual signature filters world through wonder-struck thief’s idiom. No dialogue, but voice modulates from hushed reverence to triumphant sunrise cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Strong sensory density and propulsive rhythm, yet occasional stacked metaphors (“living ribbons,” “sunrise over the horizon”) risk overwriting. No loops or scaffold; final cascade line earns its flourish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fusion of clockwork lullaby, memory-chess, and sky-wrong aurora feels fresh; tropes are re-embodied rather than borrowed. Risk-taking in lyric compression pays off without obscuring closure.</comment>
