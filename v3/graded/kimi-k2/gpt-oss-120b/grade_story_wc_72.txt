<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The living statue’s motive—welcoming nuance into ossified certainty—is stated but never embodied in a specific, costly choice; its telepathy is omnipresent yet undifferentiated, and the “incisively kind” trait is asserted rather than dramatized through contradiction or visible trade-off. No interior contradiction surfaces under pressure; the statue merely orchestrates rather than struggles.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure is a soft Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s tapestry is “speckled with nuanced colors,” but the cost is diffuse—felt more as mood than as a foreclosed path. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the memory-threading tightens pattern rather than forcing a decisive change. Orientation is clear early; no lens ambiguity at end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Phosphorescent currents, kelp arches, and marble pathways are vivid, selective, and consistently filtered through the statue’s perception. The foxglove-stained ampoule and cracked basalt arch function as micro-settings that constrain action and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—softening certainty with nuance—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: each filament of memory adds density rather than narrowing options. A visible price is missing; the garden merely “thrummed with possibilities,” leaving cost atmospheric rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the transformation of rigid myth into living ambiguity. Subtext resides in the animate-yet-lifeless paradox and the ampoule’s shifting hues. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing, though the conceptual cost remains gentle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lush, lyrical, and consistent; patterned elision (“cascading revelations”) is taught early and paid off. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity, and perceptual signature is distinct—statue’s telepathy notices “kelp whisper histories” rather than generic beauty. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is musical and dense; occasional purple swells (“tides of thought,” “tapestry speckled with nuanced colors”) flirt with overwriting but stay within taught pattern. No loops or scaffold; information density is high. One mixed metaphor—“water sang a lullaby for stone”—barely grazes clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of living statue, telepathic gardening, and foxglove-stained memory ampoule feels inevitable in hindsight. The animate-lifeless paradox is explored rather than merely stated. Risky lyric accumulation succeeds without gimmickry; no close echoes of familiar scenes.</comment>
