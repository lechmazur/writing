<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mort’s interiority is vivid and embodied—his heartbeat syncing with the snow globe’s ticking—but the “physics of letting go” is asserted more than dramatized in micro-choices. The final release of the globe is earned by prior handling, yet the contradiction between analytic detachment and emotional surrender is only implied, not enacted under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shattering globe releases crystal shards that become stars, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density increases until the final image—though the causal linkage between untangling wires and emotional release is slightly under-dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sunken library is evoked with tactile specificity—“algae-sealed windows,” “corroded brass microphone”—and the snow globe functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Environment and object together charge the ending image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the last transmission—tightens once when the final strand snaps and the captain’s love is heard. The cost is felt in Mort’s quiet gratitude and the globe’s shatter, though the escalation is more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the physics metaphor and the globe’s dissolution; no moralizing intrudes. The final image of shards becoming stars offers a non-literal, resonant answer to the question of letting go, reweighting all prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure—“each flake a moment slipping away.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent and character-bound throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Occasional poetic overlay (“physics of letting go”) risks overwriting, yet the final beat remains clear and charged. No loops or scaffold artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The sunken-library frame and wax-cylinder transmission feel fresh, not derivative. The snow globe’s transformation from souvenir to cosmic shard is an earned, non-obvious synthesis that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
