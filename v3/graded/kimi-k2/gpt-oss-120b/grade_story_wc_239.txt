<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The witness role is embodied through physical motion (walking out/journeying inward), giving her a credible interior arc, but the character’s contradictory impulses in scene are more implied than dramatized, keeping it shy of the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The closure—a crystallized final image where illusions collapse and history folds—lands on the page with felt, conceptual cost under an accumulative/textural lens; causality loops testify to spiral arbitration and reconfigure the reader’s grasp of time and choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Selective sensory detail (arch breathing, glyphs humming) constrains perception choices; the softcover dictionary subbing as micro-setting is handled in multiple beats and carries the final charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pressure rises texturally—silence intensifies, glyphs spiral, illusions tighten—tying every escalation to the witness’s stance; one meaningful intensification sufficient for this length, but protagonist agency is slightly diffused in the middle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cosmic illusion is empathetically reframed through the immediate experience of silence and light; the final image recharges the central motif without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lyrical, compressed diction maintains coherent interior voice; perceptual signature distinct under pressure; purposeful elision earns credit when pattern pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm accelerates under pressure; no loops or scaffold beyond occasional poetic repetition; occasional stacked metaphor in peak beats, yet clarity remains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of dictionary, temple, and spiral feels specific to this piece, though the quiet lyric structure prevents bolder stakes escalation.</comment>
