<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s lyrical interiority is sensor-rich yet the motivational thread occasionally slackens; her acts align with motive but don’t deepen flaw or tension in ways that ratchet cost, so the internal struggle reads distant rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Closure is a quiet lyrical reweighting (tube dropped into shaft → “truth will travel”), but causality is implied not enacted; the reader can infer but never witnesses the decisive channel open, leaving the lane of agency slightly blurred.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The dusk courtyard anchors place and mood early, channels choice through foliage-veiled spy-hole and fountain alcove; the spa­ce is not merely backdrop but dictates the tactical move that shatters city routes, so it constrains with specificity and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Quarantine stakes are introduced but remain external; pressure is announced rather than intensified. The courtyard beats pivot on concealment, yet escalation leans situational without a felt tightening in options or consequence during the moment Elara acts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of solitary integrity is organic not preached, emerging through concrete hiding acts and renunciation, yet the final lull risks settling into gentle resignation rather than hard-cost renunciation, keeping resonance sincere but slightly mild.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is dream-threaded and particular, peppered with sensory contractions (“bruised violet” sky) that feel in-scene; filter markers are sparse, line rhythm varied, and no POV leakage occurs despite compressed lyric compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>Sentences are melodic but sometimes stack soft, wistful modifiers (“whispered secrets,” “gentle calm layered”), creating slight echo; moment-to-moment propulsion is strong yet occasional filler perception labels scale back clarity, not closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The cloaked tunnel and pigeonelance are fresh, but the synthesis is more grace-note twist than premise-reframe; it reuses familiar “hidden passage under fountain” rather than a retooled concept, so ingenuity hovers mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Elara’s record-keeper mind shapes early expectation and steers the lateral move; a single sharp micro-choice under vines carries us forward, but internal contradiction never flares fully, so necessity feels middling.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Message tube is handled twice—curious brush, then sealed drop—returning with reweighted menace; its sealed vanishing becomes the tactical linchpin for city breach, so it earns mid-high linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Quarantine locks exterior routes and dictates underground tunnel choice; stakes shift from messenger exclusion to smuggle option, actively governing tactics rather than serving backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Credibly curious trait is asserted and rehearsed via shaft discovery, but it merely enables rather than constrains—little is paid for the nosiness—so the flow dips below mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>“Intuit” drives pivotal lateral tracing move; without this cross-road mapping the hidden alcove is never found, so its role is pivotal, though the mechanics of how she senses the route remain suggestive.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Lateral progression threads from courtyard inward to fountain; the spatial sidestep is taught and its mechanics shape the smuggling path with visible causal pressure, just shy of subtle schematic clarity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Dusk courtyard is environmental crucible: vine drapes conceal motion, fountain guides shaft access; setting constrains rather than decorates, aligning stakes with physical terrain.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Immediate aftermath of being followed supplies ticking urgency hinted but not tracked live; dusk timing shadows decisions but no meter visible to tighten beats with cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Oath to record storms alone parallels actual secret act; solitude versus deliverance tension is embodied as she renounces courier paths, shaping the final resonance with discernible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>Layered tranquility begins and pulses through the dusk courtyard, yet intensifies rather than modulates; the single static hue risks postcard serenity instead of charged closure drift, capping the score.</comment>
