<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her breath “avalanchingly quiet” and the flute’s “silence louder than any trumpet” reveal contradictory impulses. Motivation (harvest failure-insight) drives every micro-choice, and the final renunciation—turning the flute upside-down to let silence serve—earns its cost. Yet the absence of a second on-page character limits relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara steps back through the seam having reweighted her mission; the canyon’s low chord confirms the cost. Causal chain holds—flute note opens seam, failure-insight redefines guardianship—without gaps. Orientation is swift; lens is Accumulative/Textural, taught early by hush and echo.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range is more than backdrop; its hush and driftwood echo constrain movement and mark the seam. Sensory hierarchy—sound swallowed, light thin as breath—mirrors internal stakes. Micro-setting (flute, stone shelter) functions as extension of body and choice. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform guardianship through failure-insight—is signaled early and tightened when the seam widens. One meaningful deepening: realization that prior keepers “clung to one path” forces her stance crystallization. Cost is visible in the sealed seam and the promise to “listen to every failure.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from action: guardianship must weave failure into future growth. Subtext lives in silence—flute’s unheard song, canyon’s hush—rather than statement. Final image of wind carrying the “silent song” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked; phrases like “avalanchingly quiet” and “loom of possibility” feel character-bound. Compression and elision (“she began to uncase”) are taught early and paid off. No dialogue, so no register drift; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language serves pattern (hush, echo, weave) without clutter. Minor loop risk in “hush” repetition but cadence shifts under pressure. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Final paragraph crystallizes without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Familiar portal motif is transformed through the Accumulative/Textural lens of silence and failure-insight. Specificity—driftwood markers catching thunder echo, flute turned upside-down—creates freshness. Risk in quiet ending is earned by prior pattern.</comment>
