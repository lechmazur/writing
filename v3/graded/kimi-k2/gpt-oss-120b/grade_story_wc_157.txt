<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lysander’s defiance is vivid and embodied in seed-planting, but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the final alliance with Dr. Mirabel arrives without visible cost to his guarded spark.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse becomes a living archive, cost felt in the irreversible warp of order. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pattern taught early via spirals and chant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Greenhouse glass, insects, and gourd seed constrain tactics and charge the final image; sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is coherent; no orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting untaxed thought—tightens when Dr. Mirabel’s arrival threatens exposure; alliance forecloses the option of solitary secrecy. Cost is implied but not viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of intellectual freedom emerges organically from seed-cipher and insect chorus; final image of “unpayable freedom” reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext in seed-whispers is effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture sustained; patterned elision (“candidly cryptic verses”) taught early and paid off. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue minimal but voice-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet mostly propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“kaleidoscope of fragrant, humming possibilities”) flirt with overwriting but do not stall closure. No loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tax-on-thought dystopia with botanical cryptography; gourd-rattle seed as rebel drum feels inevitable. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
