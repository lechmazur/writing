<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Survivor’s grief, fusion-seeking resolve, and perceptual signature all consistent; thrusting hand into fissure entails visible, high-cost choice that crystallizes Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens controlled from bruised-violet sky to crystallized finale; each beat lifts density and cadence, final Charged Poise (geode shards floating, bleak exhilaration) lands with felt conceptual cost. No causality gaps, orientation clear at 80 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Floating observatory rotors, gore-stained suit, and hum of cooling breakers are all tactile; geode as micro-setting constrains final plunge and charges closure image. Selective sensory detail mirrors ambient mourning without ornamental sprawl.</comment>
<question>4</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—locating and merging with dormant potential—is signaled early; pressure deepens through successive frequency calibrations that foreclose safe retreat. One intensification suffices; cost is the blistering internal tide he must absorb alone.</comment>
<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Awakening-as-process emerges via specific manipulations of probability lattices and geode shards; final shimmer of hovering sun-fragments answers the thematic question without overt moralising.</comment>
<question>6</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Narrative voice is bleak-lyric, compression purposeful (“the sky… a bruised violet”), POV never wavers; sensory filtering under grief pressured diction maintains clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm controlled via breath-length sentences and caesura; zero scaffolding, vivid verb-noun pairings “circuit breakers hissed like dying beasts” drive momentum. Metaphoric density never occludes causality at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Drone-strike survivor turned geode-tuned Mage-Hunter is an arresting synthesis; negative-space sci-fi grief ritual feels inevitable yet new, closing on levitating crystal suns—bold, crackling, fully earned.</comment>
