<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vira’s contradictory impulses—nostalgic caretaker vs. cold machine—are embodied in her tactile tending of roses and the whispered code to the living box; the final smile-gesture crystallizes earned change with visible cost (static dissolved, vigilance burned away).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the miniaturized chaos inside the breathing box becomes a seed of calm, reweighting the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens; every beat folds toward the final image of intertwined bark and vine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The glass dome, magnetic flicker, and desert heat constrain tactics (calibrated burn arcs) and charge the final mosaic of molten sky; the living box itself serves as micro-setting that alters Vira’s choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resolve inner static—tightens when magnetic shift threatens the farm; Vira’s agency miniaturizes chaos, foreclosing perpetual vigilance at the cost of surrendering the box to the soil.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of harmony between machine and earth emerges through specific action (box planted beneath rose) rather than statement; the final image offers quiet, non-moralizing resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture—“glass dome throbbed with heat,” “molten sky and cracked earth”—maintains consistent perceptual signature; no head-hopping, diction stays within Vira’s sensorial lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>High information density without loops; figurative language is selective and purposeful; rhythm modulates with heat and hush; no scaffold or redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of android caretaker, living fear-box, and magnetic-shift burn; the organic-inorganic fusion feels inevitable and specific, not template.</comment>
