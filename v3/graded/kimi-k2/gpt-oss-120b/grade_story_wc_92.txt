<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s calmly inventive trait is shown through micro-choices (tracing sundial, placing quill) but interiority is abstract; no embodied contradiction under pressure. The revolution motive is stated early yet never clashes with fear or doubt, so the final renunciation feels lightly earned rather than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cradle’s invisible currents reconfigure the garrison’s mindset, cost felt in their quiet disobedience. Causal chain (sundial clues → bronze quill → cradle activation) is coherent; blackout timeframe anchors early. Minor drift: “unexplained blackout” never narrows tactical options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Luminous fort walls, phosphorescent pulse, and glass-rose balconies are vivid and selective; micro-setting of the sundial constrains Kael’s decoding action. Setting subtly guides choice via residual light and echoing corridors. A few static “luminous” repetitions dull specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—silent revolution—signaled early; pressure tightens when blackout forces covert action. Escalation is one deepening: cradle activation changes knowledge state of garrison. Cost is conceptual (loss of unquestioning obedience) rather than visceral; still legible under Accumulative/Textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of awakening without violence emerges from images—phosphorescent pulse, cradle sparks—rather than statement. Final “quiet thunder” reweights prior blackout into canvas for light. Subtext in shared smiles and rewritten logbooks avoids moralizing. One near-theme line (“built of translucent marble… beauty”) edges toward overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays close to Kael’s selective attention; perceptual signature in “constellations waiting to be read.” Rhythm modulates with blackout hush vs. dawn release. Occasional elevated diction (“phosphorescent moss”) momentarily drifts from Kael’s lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is lyrical yet propulsive; sentence lengths vary to mimic hush and surge. Minor loop: “luminous” and “winking hush” repeat without pattern-teaching. Metaphors mostly coherent; “sleeping giant” cliché is the one slack image. High information density overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: revolution via invisible idea-sparks rather than arms; cradle device reimagines insurgency. Fort architecture of light and glass feels specific to this tale. Risk taken in quiet climax pays off; not a template plot. One echo—bronze quill as key—avails familiar trope but is reweighted at closure.</comment>
