<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora’s interiority is lyrically rendered and embodied, but her contradictory impulses remain diffuse; the “unlearning” never collides with a specific, costly choice. The final renunciation of noise is felt more as atmospheric shift than character-driven forfeiture. Secondary pressure from the tile flake is present yet abstract, so status dynamics stay muted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the emergent hush crystallizes meaning and reweights prior echoes with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each mandala line thickens the silence until it becomes a palpable veil. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. One minor drift: the violinist coda feels additive rather than integral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The grotto’s mist, slick walls, and lilac hue are selectively detailed and filter through Liora’s chalk-worn perception. The tile flake and sand mandala act as micro-settings that constrain her gestures and channel the hush. Sensory economy is high; no static cataloguing. One missed beat: spatial choreography when the flake lifts is slightly ghosted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming fragmented echoes into coherent silence—is signaled early and escalates through each traced spiral. The tightening is accretive: every grain released raises the cost of further noise. Agency is present yet diffuse; the final hush arrives more as culmination than decisive act. Felt price is conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of unlearning as generative silence emerges organically from image and action; no moralizing. The lilac unease modulates into pastel peace without tidy resolution. Subtext lives in gesture—the tile’s hum, the sand’s shift—rather than statement. Final image reweights the premise: silence as communal language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and perceptually specific: “lilac unease,” “captured sigh.” Syntax breathes with the grotto’s condensation. No head-hopping; POV distance remains intimate. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off in the hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; each sentence layers texture without redundancy. Occasional soft-focus phrases (“emergent hush,” “unlearning”) risk conceptual loop but stay within pattern. No line-level artifacts touch closure. Metaphors cohere; no mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The chalk artist who coaxes silence from sand and stone feels fresh; the whispering tile flake is not a generic MacGuffin but a resonant object that reweights meaning. Risky lyric mode succeeds without obscuring causality. Specificity of lilac unease and emergent hush anchors universals.</comment>
