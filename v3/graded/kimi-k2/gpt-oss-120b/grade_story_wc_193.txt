<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“pressure of truth would always spawn brilliance”), but the survivor’s wariness is more asserted than dramatized; the final choice to trust the quantum promise is credible yet slightly under-costed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bolt’s transformation reweights the premise and the survivor’s past debts. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; pressure tightens through mushroom pulse and glitch cadence. Cost is felt in the warning that diamonds endure only while pressure stays tangible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Farm’s violet glow and fungal veins are selective, tactile, and directly constrain the ritual; the bolt’s remembered oceanic pressure charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate pressure into diamonds without repeating pyramid betrayal—escalates via mushroom pulse and glitch texts. One decisive tightening: securing the bolt crystallizes both diamonds and moral stance. Cost is legible in the conditional endurance of the gems.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme of honest volunteering vs. predatory promise emerges through concrete ritual and luminous payoff. Final image reweights prior exploitation into creative covenant without moralizing. Subtext in glitchy playfulness and ledger glow sustains ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and POV-locked; “shadowseam wonder” and “righteous mischief” carry distinct idiom. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final spore-cascade. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layering (“mushroom glow scattering into kaleidoscope”) is purposeful and pattern-taught. Minor synonym loops (“quantum promise” x3) nudge down but do not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Fresh synthesis of pyramid trauma, quantum ontology, and fungal alchemy; submarine bolt as diamond seed is non-obvious yet inevitable. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passed.</comment>
