<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren’s interiority is vivid: her scarred skin, the “hard softness,” the embodied memory of lost hikers. Yet some beats abstract emotion (“a promise she had traded for three lives”) before concrete micro-choices occur. The bargain is reconfigured through the final gift, showing cost via the village children’s smiles, but the hikers’ personal guilt could be tightened in one extra micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: opening the box refracts light into universal grief, reweighting the earlier “bargain” without violating it. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each image deepens density until the cascade of light reconfigures meaning. Causality holds with no late rule change and a visible social cost (the “return of innocence”).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting is specific: moonlit ridge, smoldering ash beneath, “silver ribbon stitching sky to earth.” These details constrain action (slippery slope, heat memory) and echo internal scars. One more tactile cue—wind direction or timber snap—would push the constraint over 8-band; still strong.</question>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Central stake—whether pain can be translated into shared language—escalates through reflection, then the literal beam of light. One decisive narrowing occurs when she realises the bargain had always been “gift it back,” not repayment. Costs are felt on page: villagers’ wide eyes, children’s transformed smiles.</question>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Pain into universal language emerges organically via the box’s cracked fragments scattering moonlight. No overt preaching—the final image reframes prior material. Slight softness at “translate pain” being explicitly voiced once, but ambiguity remains credible.</question>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Voice is textured and poetically compressed: “slow waltz of celestial bodies,” “ash whispering back the names of trees.” Lyric elision is taught early and legible at closure. No head-hopping; focalization remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Rhythm matches emotional pressure.</question>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Strong read-aloud rhythm, high information density; lines advance purpose. Minor accumulation of abstract phrasing (“hard softness,” “echo beats of her heart”) once at midpoint—clears when light literally hardens in children’s eyes. No loops or scaffolds near beat level.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Premise—“cracked porcelain as vessel for collective innocence”—is fresh, non-obvious, and transforms a fairy-tale token into a civic ritual. No derivative echoes. Risk heightens stakes without obscured clarity. The moment of light rain remains singular.</question>
