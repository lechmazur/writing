<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; her “patchwork of distant lives” never crystallizes into a specific contradiction that forces a visible choice. The final promise to guard forever is voiced, not embodied, so the cost feels asserted rather than dramatized. Still, her embodied singing and the orchard’s response give enough micro-action to sustain a single POV arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror world’s night thins into sunrise, and Lira’s stance crystallizes into permanent guardianship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each song-layer thickens the dawn-loom until the final image reweights the realm. Cost is implied in her whispered “never again surrender to silence,” but the price remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse breathes with copper-scented bark and mirror-leaves; every sensory choice feeds the dawn-loom’s glow. The mica window evolves from fragile pane to breathing lung, constraining Lira’s final stance. Spatial anchors are clear early; the orchard’s glass and vines function as micro-setting that guides her song.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm—is signaled early and escalates through song-fed light that thaws soil and sky. One meaningful tightening: the night’s veil visibly lifts, foreclosing perpetual darkness. Cost is conceptual (eternal vigilance) rather than tangible, but the pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal weaving emerges through prismatic light binding wandering spirits; no moral is stated. The final sunrise reweights the orchard’s hum into a collective heartbeat. Subtext is carried by gesture—spirals of silver vines, shared memories—avoiding overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent; patterned elision (“woven dawns,” “bound release”) is taught early and paid off in the final lullaby. Perceptual signature is Lira’s synesthetic synapses—copper scent, mirror leaves—without head-hop. Compression occasionally edges purple but stays purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative layering risks overwriting in places (“ribbons of light,” “tapestry of twilight and gold”) but never stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or cadence. Minor register drift toward liturgical grandeur is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Alchemical orchard, memory-keeper, and dawn-loom synthesize into a fresh mythic ecology. The mirror-world frame and song-alchemy avoid stock fantasy templates. Risk lies in high lyricism, but specificity of copper-jasmine bark and mica lungs keeps it grounded.</comment>
