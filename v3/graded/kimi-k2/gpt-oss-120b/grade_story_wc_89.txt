<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liora’s yearning for Arion is palpable and embodied; the bark-patterned skin and shared breath crystallize the cost. Interiority is specific, but the “reluctant” aspect of the metamorphosis is asserted more than dramatized—no moment shows her actively resisting before surrender. Still, the final fusion reads as earned and irreversible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the merged form is on-page, the cost (loss of full humanity) is visible, and the lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift reweight the bond. Orientation is swift; causality holds. Minor ellipsis in how the spices actually open the veil is acceptable under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The orchard’s moonlit vines and glowing jars constrain every beat; the scent of spices literally enables the veil-opening. Micro-setting (her bark-veined palm) charges the final image. A touch more spatial anchoring at the very start would nudge it to 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reunion with Arion—is signaled early and tightened once: the metamorphosis exacts bodily cost. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no false reversals. The price is felt, though the escalation is single-note rather than deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of eternal reciprocity emerges through concrete fusion rather than statement. The final image of nightly spice offerings quietly reframes death as ongoing dialogue. No moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that mirrors orchard pulse. Perceptual signature—“orchard itself were a pulse she could feel through her soles”—is sustained. No head-hopping; diction stays within Liora’s mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers scent, light, and emotion. One minor loop—“luminous grove… luminous canopy”—is the only detectable repetition. Metaphors cohere; no mixed vehicles. Closure line is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Familiar mythic tropes (phoenix, stag, eternal orchard) are transfigured through sensory specificity and bodily fusion. The spice-paste mechanics feel fresh, and the final nightly offering ritual is an unexpected, inevitable coda. Risky lyric compression pays off.</comment>
