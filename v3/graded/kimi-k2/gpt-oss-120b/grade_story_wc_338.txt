<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“trembling arm,” “shielded openness”), but the map-framer’s contradictory impulses remain muted; her final act of aligning footage feels inevitable yet lacks a palpable cost that forecloses a path. Motivation is consistent, yet the absence of a second character or status shift limits relational crucible pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chapel’s “muted chorus” reweights the boundary between known and unknown with felt conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of rain, footage, map tear—tightening through density rather than causal turns. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault and henge are rendered with tactile specificity (“wet plaster,” “pallid white drizzle”) and constrain the projector placement and map overlay. Micro-setting (the torn map itself) functions as charged object that reconfigures meaning at closure. Meets 9+ gate but lacks a final environmental constraint that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reopening the chapel’s silence—escalates through pattern intensification: matching raindrops across decades tightens the boundary. One meaningful deepening when glyphs appear under overlay. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; still legible under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of empathy as cartography emerges organically from the act of aligning footage and map; no explicit moralizing. Final image of “muted chorus” offers non-literal answer to how silence is interpreted. Subtext in shadows and glyphs avoids abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with perceptual signature in cartographic metaphors (“stone echo,” “frayed for years”). Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal texture—stable and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional stacked modifiers (“rain-scoured fresco vault smelled of wet plaster and distant thunder”) risk overwriting but stay within pattern. No loops or scaffold; information density high. One mixed metaphor (“stone echo”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses archival footage, geomancy, and empathy into a fresh synthesis; transformation test passes—story would collapse if elements swapped. Quiet risk in lyric accumulative structure pays off. No derivative echoes.</comment>
