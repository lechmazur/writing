<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but stays embodied; the janitor’s vow and tremor-response give a credible, costly shift. Motivation (empathic custodianship) is consistent and intensifies to the final promise. No contradictory impulses on stage—more reverent monolith than conflicted psyche—so 9+ gate not quite met.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of star-stories and lantern pulses tightens toward the Earned Stasis of the vow. Closure is on-page—the ribbon binding sky to stone, felt tremor—cost is the janitor’s lifelong vigil. Orientation is clear by 3rd sentence; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Station, lantern, and valley are vividly etched and filter through the janitor’s ritual perception. The lantern’s amber glow becomes micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Weathered stone and copper tubes feel tactile and lived-in. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: honoring fallen stars through empathic witness. Pressure deepens via accumulating star-paths and the tremor-response that ratifies the vow. One meaningful tightening—vow crystallizes stillness into duty. Cost is the perpetual night-watch; felt on page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “strength in vulnerability” emerges through star-fall empathy and the janitor’s whispered vow, never sermonized. Final image of molten sunrise on cracked stone reweights prior stillness as fertile ground. Subtext in lantern pulse and ribbon curl avoids explicit moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is hushed, cosmic, and consistent; perceptual signature filters every detail through reverent custodial awe. Syntax modulates from long breaths to crystalline fragments under pressure. No dialogue, so no register clash. Compression and elision taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet precise; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Rhythm breathes with scene needs. No loops or scaffold, no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction fits the cosmic register. Final third remains clean—no artifacts near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor trope is refreshed through empathic custodianship and lantern-as-conduit. Specificity of “yellow lantern glass” and “flourishing stillness” feels inevitable, not ornamental. Risky lyric accumulation lands without gimmickry. Transformation test passes—story would collapse with generic keeper.</comment>
