<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rook’s interiority is vivid—his nose “retained an intuitively descriptive keenness,” his heart “thumped” at the leaf’s promise—but the shift from passive observer to active guardian is more asserted than dramatized; the final promise is voiced to the wind rather than tested in a choice that costs him something visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Rook seals the leaf and whispers his vow, a Charged Poise that reconfigures his purpose from finder to keeper. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each color band and memory layer tightens the emotional density until the final hush. Cost is felt in the “choir of distant voices” now lodged in him.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The scrapyard’s rusted towers, cracked pavement, and metallic dust are not backdrop but instruments: the kiosk collapse hides the chest, the wind sings through the grooves. The leaf itself becomes micro-setting, its copper veins glinting like “a sun-lit river,” charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—binding the living to the dead—is signaled early and escalates through each color-revelation. The final tightening occurs when Rook lifts the leaf and the voices flood in, foreclosing his retirement; the cost is the lifelong burden of carrying those voices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-connection emerges organically from Rook’s sensory labor; no moral is stated. The wax-sealed leaf reweights the premise: distance collapses into closeness not as comfort but as unending responsibility, leaving a resonant chill.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is sinewy and specific—“pruning the hush,” “metallic dust that sang under his weight.” Compression and lyric elision are taught early and paid off in the final “wild hush.” No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Rook’s perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, color, and memory without redundancy. Occasional elevated diction (“mythic device”) slightly drifts from canine POV but never stalls momentum or muddies the closing image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic bloodhound decoding war memories through colored light is fresh, yet grounded in tactile detail. The risk—lyric canine interiority—pays off by making the impossible feel inevitable; no trope is left untransformed.</comment>
