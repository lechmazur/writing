<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s blank mask and interior hollowness are vividly rendered, but her “morally ambiguous purpose” is asserted, not dramatized; no concrete choice risks or costs her anything. The whittling narration is performative, yet we never see her weigh a trade-off or suffer a consequence for offering art under the mandate. The arc lands in a static “quiet redemption” that feels bestowed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise: the baton and bouquet crystallize a new hush that lets sorrow breathe within forced joy—cost is the continuing need for secrecy. Causality is accumulative/textural: each shaving narrated adds density until the final image reweights the emotional stakes. The lens holds, but the piece repeats the same beat—whittle, narrate, insist on lightness—without tightening options or raising price, so escalation stays flat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Farmhouse, turbines, cedar shavings, and dried petals are tactile and filtered through Mara’s alienated attention; the turbines’ shadows pacing the walls externalize surveillance. Spatial anchors arrive by line 5 and remain coherent. The setting never constrains a new choice—turbines loom but never complicate tactics—so it supports atmosphere more than plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—can Mara carve a permissible space for grief inside mandated joy?—is clear early. Pressure is situational and static: the mandate looms, but no beat narrows her options or raises the price of discovery; repetition replaces escalation. The climax reconfigures meaning rather than risk, so the conflict plateaus mid-range.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme—art as clandestine shelter for outlawed sorrow—emerges through image (brittle petals, cedar curls) rather than thesis. The final hush reframes prior repetitions with quiet cost: performance now sustains silence instead of betraying it. Some late narrated abstractions (“even decay could hold a story”) edge toward echo, but ambiguity stays intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited clings to Mara’s numb, theatrical sensorium; diction stays spare, slowed, almost liturgical, matching the turbines’ drone. No head-hopping or register drift. The voice achieves distinct texture, though syntactic cadence repeats enough to verge on mantra; still, the pattern is taught early and pays off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; most sentences dual-task (action + atmosphere). Occasional paraphrase loops—“carving light from sorrow” restated three ways—dull momentum. No mixed metaphors or scaffolding, but the turbine/hush lexicon grows slightly hypnotic without new inflection, keeping the score just shy of top tier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The happiness-mandate dystopia is familiar, but the response—ritual whittling of a baton to smuggle grief into enforced cheer—feels fresh and specific. Details (cedar snow, turbine-shadow surveillance) transform stock parts into a singular ritual. Risk is moderate: static scene, no external challenge, yet the internal conceit sustains its own oxygen.</comment>
