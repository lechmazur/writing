<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s claustrophobia is embodied in shallow breath and trembling hands; her vow to “stand by the unremembered” is dramatized when she risks phase-stranding to recover the codex. The final burial of the book is a credible renunciation that costs her future access, sealing the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the codex’s burial reweights the premise—she chooses guardianship over possession. Causal chain holds (tide → phase arrays → codex alignment → return), and the cost is legible in the final image of her “quiet triumph” and the codex sealed beyond tides.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rusted facility, serpentine cables, and brine-scented air are vivid and selective; the codex itself becomes micro-setting that constrains her final choice. Environment and object jointly charge the ending when the buried codex is placed “where no tide could reach,” fusing setting and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover and preserve the codex’s map of invisible currents—is tested by the lethal phase transition. One tightening beat: aligning codex with console triggers dimensional fold, foreclosing retreat until return protocol is whispered. Cost is the permanent surrender of the codex.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Theme of remembrance versus erasure emerges through the codex’s fate; no explicit moralizing. The final burial offers a non-literal answer—choosing to forget so the world remembers—creating lingering ambiguity without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Voice is tactile and marine-salted (“tasted of brine and old metal”), with rhythmic compression under pressure. POV remains tight; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature sustains through phase transition and final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is purposeful (“jellyfish bellies lit from within”). No loops or scaffold; syntax breathes with scene tempo. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” zone) but does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Fresh synthesis of marine gothic, dimensional tech, and archival ritual; the codex-as-map-of-invisible-currents feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky phase-transition mechanics are fully committed to and paid off in closure.</comment>
