<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—panic coils, memories surface—but the “harness the ephemeral” motive arrives as a late, abstract epiphany rather than a trait-driven escalation. The final renunciation (letting the beacon fade) is emotionally legible yet feels externally prompted by temple decree rather than by an earned contradiction inside her. Still, embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure keep her above mid-tier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s sacrifice of the beacon reweights the premise, and the temple’s amber hush crystallizes the cost. Causality is mostly Accumulative/Textural—patterned intensification of scent, memory, and tide—held without contradiction. A slight lens wobble occurs when the temple “demands” the price; the rule is asserted rather than taught early, but the final image recharges prior motifs cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The temple’s kelp-draped pillars, bioluminescent glyphs, and moon-cool basalt are selective and POV-filtered; each detail either constrains movement or charges the final hush. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the vial’s placement on the altar is tactile and causally linked. Environment earns its keep by shaping the decisive act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—secure the sunrise-scent for the surface—is signaled early and tightened when Mara must trade the beacon for it. The single meaningful turn (renouncing rescue) narrows options and carries visible cost. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: scent thickens, tide calms, memory surges, until choice crystallizes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of bottling eternity emerges organically from scent, memory, and sacrifice; no moralizing summary intrudes. The final release of perfume into morning air reconfigures meaning without stating it. Subtext operates in the temple’s wordless glyphs and the hush that “touches memories,” inviting reflection on transience and stewardship.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise—“kelp and dust,” “moonlit glass”—with rhythmic control that mirrors Mara's slowing pulse. POV remains tightly anchored; no head-hopping. Compression and patterned elision (“the gathered hush gathering”) are taught early and paid off in the final exhalation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; figurative language clusters around the vial and tide without clogging beats. Occasional soft repeats (“gathered hush,” “unsnarl”) are motif-driven and legible. No loops or mixed metaphors mar the closure beat; final sentence lands clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The perfume-as-time-capture premise is familiar, yet the underwater temple, bioluminescent price, and synesthetic “scent of sunrise” feel freshly synthesized. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test passes: swap the setting or object and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>
