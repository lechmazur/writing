<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but occasionally drifts into abstract self-explanation (“I must prove…”) rather than embodied contradiction; the custodian’s stubborn hope is consistent and the final vow carries visible cost, yet the shard’s agency sometimes overrides the custodian’s micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the beacon’s steady glow crystallizes a before/after stance with felt communal cost. Causal chain (prism alignment → ribbon of light → lantern steady) is clear; orientation is anchored early; only a mild lens wobble between causal and accumulative keeps it from 9.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Glass pavilion and tower are tactile, humming, and star-mapped; they constrain alignment angles and supply the resonant shell for the beacon’s song. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful; a few atmospheric phrases verge on decorative but never stall momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving coincidences carry meaning—tightens through the prism alignment beat, narrowing options to one precise star path. Cost is visible (custodian’s solitary vigil amplified by travelers’ arrival), yet escalation is single-arc rather than deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of pattern versus chance emerges organically from the custodian’s ritual and the shard’s retrocognitive echoes; final image of caravan devices harmonizing with the hush reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext hums in glass and starlight rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and perceptually specific—“thistle-blown hope,” “wind’s memory”—without head-hopping. Syntax modulates with emotional swell; only a few elevated phrases drift slightly above the custodian’s plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive; occasional metaphor layering (“shard of hush,” “thistle-blown hope”) is patterned and paid off. No loops or scaffold; one mixed metaphor (“ribbon of light…kisses the tarnished lantern”) momentarily blurs physics but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic beacon-keeper trope is refreshed through retrocognitive silence and star-path cartography; synthesis feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Risk lies in lyric compression, but coherence holds. Derivative echoes are faint and transformed.</comment>
