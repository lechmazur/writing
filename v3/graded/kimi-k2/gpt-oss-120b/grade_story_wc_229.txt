<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and specific—her “tears glistening like dew” and “screaming tenderness” show contradictory impulses under pressure. The micro-choice to crack the vial cork is causally tied to her stated motive and carries visible cost (the empty cork on the rail). However, the fisherman remains off-stage, so relationship crucible and status dynamics do not apply; the arc is purely internal, yet still earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse beam syncs with Mara’s heartbeat, reweighting the premise that whispers travel farther. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (scent, vibration, light) intensifies until the final image crystallizes cost. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causality breaks. The persistent constraint is the cracked, empty cork—silent proof of spent intent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The cobalt stones, brass lantern, and garden perfume are filtered through Mara’s urgent bias; the lighthouse itself becomes a beating heart that constrains her final stance. Sensory hierarchy narrows to scent and vibration under pressure. Spatial choreography is clean; the fisherman’s boat tracks believably from reef to cliff. The setting charges the closure image rather than serving as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther”—is signaled early and tested by the fisherman’s compass tug. Escalation is accretive: each pulse of intent tightens the weave of scent and light until the beam answers. Cost is visible in the emptied vial and the silent scream of love she must bear alone. One meaningful tightening suffices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: soft intent wields more force than coercion. Subtext lives in gesture—the cork’s cracked surface catching dawn light speaks louder than any manifesto. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic echo in the closing lines; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual signature; diction (“screaming tenderness,” “luminous thread”) is hers, not authorial flourish. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity—long lyrical sentences swell, then contract at the crack of the seal. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers scent, light, or vibration without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—vibration as tide, scent as bridge—and serve the accretive design. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. The final cascade of light is rendered with precision, not purple excess.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The fusion of scent-magic and lighthouse tech feels fresh; the “vibration of intent” trope is grounded in tactile ritual rather than abstract mysticism. Specificity of cobalt stones, brass lantern, and cracked cork prevents generic fantasy drift. While the premise nods to familiar “soft power beats force,” the execution through sensory accretion and earned stasis is non-obvious.</comment>
