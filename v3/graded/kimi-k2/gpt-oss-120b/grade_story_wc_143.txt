<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied (“a tremor of grief”); the inspector’s curiosity is dramatized through micro-choices (calibrating the chemical timer, whispering to the summit). The final renunciation—accepting loss while sealing the grain—earns its cost. Yet the trait “purposefully curious” is asserted more than tested under rising pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shutter’s click crystallizes the moment the grain’s story is archived, reconfiguring the inspector’s stance from witness to elegist. Causal chain (timer → reaction → shutter) holds; the cost is the irreversible loss of the grain. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The moonlit summit constrains every move—powdery basalt swallows tripod legs, sunrise angle dictates timing. The grain itself becomes micro-setting, its speckled surface reflecting “a thousand nights.” Environment and object jointly charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—preserve the last grain—tightens once: the rising sun erases the grain’s unspent time. Agency is the calibrated chemical reaction that forces the shutter at the precise instant, trading the grain for its image. Cost is legible in the inspector’s whispered farewell.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</question>
<comment>Theme of archiving impermanence emerges through the grain’s journey from witness to photograph; no moralizing. The final whisper (“May the grain’s story travel farther…”) offers resonant, non-literal closure that reweights the premise without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Voice is lunar, precise, and melancholic: “nascent Earth sunrise,” “ghost of the nightwatch.” Syntax modulates with pressure—long lyrical cadences slow at dawn, then compress into the single click. No POV drift; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and function. Occasional soft phrases (“canvas of soft gold”) flirt with overwriting but never stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; final image is unmarred by artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</question>
<comment>Premise—archiving a single grain of lunar midnight—feels fresh and inevitable. The chemical-timer shutter is a novel, non-gimmicky device. Specificity of the grain’s history and the inspector’s ritual transform a familiar elegy into singular experience.</comment>
