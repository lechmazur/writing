<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Internal contradictions (“retrocognitively trapped”) are embodied in micro-choices—kneeling, tracing, whispering “Hearthsteel.” Renunciation is credible and feels costly; yet some interior monologue edges toward label language (“aberrant mercy” is repeated instead of dramatized), preventing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly in a lyrical Conceptual Repricing: ‘each chipped fragment a reminder of mercy forged in steel.’ The renaming act reconfigures both the plaza’s social meaning and the protagonist’s relationship to his own past; however, motivation for the earlier retrocognition loop is stated more than pressured, which modestly blurs causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The “shattered sky”/“ash-gray stones” couple is vivid and purposeful, filtering perception through soot taste. A single minaret tessera and the stepping-stone recur with reweighted meaning. Environment is leveraged, not just scenic, yet lacks a physical constraint that directly thwarts tactics (no 9+ qualifier).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes hinge on transforming civic empathy in the wake of fire; pressure is single, coherent, and escalates through the ritual act. One deepening choice (the communal treading) visibly narrows remaining options and locks in the cost. Emotional stakes are palpable, though political stakes stay poetic rather than tangible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>“Hearthsteel” emerges as an organic concretizing of the theme—the fusion of fire-pain and metal-resolve. The piece avoids moral labels and resists tidy thesis statements, relying on the mosaic image to reweight meaning. Minor abstraction creep in the phrase “cradle empathy in arms of steel” slightly blunts subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is tightly locked to the gentle radical; diction is ornate yet consistent, with sentence rhythms that breathe under pressure. Mosaic metaphors (“living diagram of hope”) are voice-motivated rather than decorative. No head-hopping; only slight drift into explanatory gloss around “children gathered” prevents the next tier.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid, but repeated “warm coldness” and “aberrant mercy” create minor paraphrase loops that dull edge. Imagery avoids cliché vehicles and sustains momentum; no major clarity hit, so slips don’t break closure gate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Concept of reforged civic empathy through ritual renaming is non-obvious and executed with lyrical gravity. No stock post-apocalypse tropes; details feel lived-in. Integration risk is underlined by the “chipped patterns,” an inventive micro-asset that earns its place in closure.</comment>
