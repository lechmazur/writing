<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is embodied in tactile pigment work and the coin’s grooves; her blindness and drive to “mirror the sky” create a credible contradiction that culminates in pressing the coin into wet plaster—an earned, costly gesture that forecloses escape. The flaw of blindness is not merely stated but shapes every micro-choice. Minor slip: “face blind eyes finally seeing” edges toward diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pigment layer and timed drying interval tightens the texture until the mural’s shimmer becomes the resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page—the sky inhales, the building falls, the image survives with conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The hollowed tree trunk is not backdrop but active constraint: bark-lined aisles guide brush paths, leaf-filled windows meter light, the coin’s alcove is a spatial puzzle. Final image of the “cathedral of sky” recharges every prior sensory cue. Micro-setting (coin, pigments) constrains tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture the sky before demolition—tightens via the noon deadline; each timed pigment layer is a micro-choice under pressure. No reversal, but the deepening pattern of drying intervals narrows options until the mural’s completion becomes the irrevocable act. Cost is the loss of the library and the safe’s closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of limits as thresholds emerges organically: every boundary (blindness, demolition, coin grooves) becomes a map. Final image of sky persisting amid rubble offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. No thematic drift; complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, modulating from hush to thunder without register drift. Sensory diction (“crushed lapis, ground bone ash, whisper of copper”) is POV-bound. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; perceptual signature of a blind artist who “feels light’s rhythm” is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers pigment, light, or time. No loops or scaffold; metaphors (“sunrise trapped in timber”) are coherent. Rhythm accelerates with demolition countdown. Minor elevated diction (“azure,” “cathedral”) fits lyric mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Premise—face-blind artist painting sky inside a doomed tree-library via constellation coin—feels fresh yet inevitable. Transformation test: swap any element and the arc collapses. Risk in lyric accumulation pays off in the charged final image.</comment>
