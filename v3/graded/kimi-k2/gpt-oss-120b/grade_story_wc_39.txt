<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The poet’s interiority is vivid—his trembling fingers, the “wistful gaze”—but the shift from solitary collector to communal teacher happens in summary rather than a single, pressured choice; the child’s arrival is external catalyst rather than earned crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the loft becomes “a chapel of resonance,” the jars’ chorus reweights the stake from private salvation to communal transmission, and the poet’s whispered promise carries felt cost—he leaves the safety of the loft. Accumulative/Textural lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The loft’s cracked shutters, sand-torn wood, and amber sunrise are selective, sensory, and tethered to the poet’s body; the music box and jars function as micro-setting objects that constrain how memory is handled and ultimately charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating ancestral sound—intensifies through each jar sealed; the tightening is the irrevocable act of gifting a jar to the child, foreclosing the poet’s sole ownership. Cost is visible: he walks into the desert lighter yet lonelier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of intergenerational memory emerges organically from the poet’s tactile ritual; the final image of the child hearing his grandmother’s lullaby offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext lives in the hush between jar and ear.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet grounded in the poet’s perceptual bias—sand “painted with fragile gold,” jars “like constellations.” Syntax modulates with emotional crests; no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“dust motes to dance like tiny planets”) flirt with overwriting yet serve the accumulative design. No loops, clean grammar, strong cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The glass-jar phonograph conceit feels fresh and inevitable; the transformation of a music box into a vessel for ancestral memory avoids cliché. Specificity of dunes and loft anchors the concept, resisting generic template.</comment>
