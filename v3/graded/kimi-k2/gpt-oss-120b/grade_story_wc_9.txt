<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cartomancer’s grief and paradoxical resolve are embodied in tactile micro-choices (unfastening clasp, cradling dew), but interior contradiction is asserted rather than dramatized; the final renunciation feels willed rather than earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reclaimed droplet reconfigures the twins’ future with felt cost (her own vanishing). Causal linkage is lyric rather than strict; lens reads Accumulative/Textural and holds, though orientation drifts early and is never fully anchored.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The midnight glade is evoked with synesthetic density; the saucer-crack map and crystal blossom function as micro-setting objects that constrain and finally charge the closure image. Spatial coherence slips once—distance to staircase is never grounded—but the final image redeems.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim lost time to heal the twins’ unborn sighs—is signaled early. Escalation is lyrical accumulation rather than tightening; pressure rises through sensory density rather than narrowing options. Cost is legible only in the cartomancer’s self-erasure at the end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme of cloudbound repentance emerges through image pattern (crack, vapor, dew) rather than statement. Final reconfiguration—time reclaimed at the price of her presence—offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing. Subtext is strongest in the saucer’s shift from wound to blossom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent; perceptual signature filters everything through charcoal-dusted synesthesia. Occasional syntactic overload (“choking beauty that wrapped the soul in velvet”) edges purple, but compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final hush.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and information-dense, yet figurative layering sometimes obscures action (“velvet”/“silk”/“nebula” in three sentences). No paraphrase loops, but stacked metaphors in peak beats dull clarity. Rhythm modulates well with emotional crests.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Cloud-ritual cartomancy and time-dew premise feel fresh; familiar grief-heal arc is transformed through tactile objects and inverted sacrifice. Specificity of “birthday tablecloth constellations” and “crystal blossom” prevents template drift. Risk is present but slightly muffled by lyric excess.</comment>
