<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-gleaner vocation is vivid and embodied—every wrist-twist with the needle anchors her interior stakes. One flaw: “restless spirits found a place to rest” summarizes an earned payoff already dramatized, dulling the final beat. Otherwise motives feel consistent, interior contradictions present but not foregrounded; still, the price is felt as she tucks the revived mask away.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a lucid Earned Stasis: the last net-thread wound round the mask seals an inevitable end rather than a twist. Accumulation/textural lens is foregrounded and coherent; the “hush” tightens until the prism’s colors breathe—cost is the soft extinction of star-glow and Elara herself now bound as keeper. Causality is implied rather than linear, taught early and paid off without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Space and tool function as micro-setting: the prism’s refracted starlight becomes a living respiration that mirrors the hush density. Sanctuary geometry stays tactically relevant—walls dilate to receive each sigh and exhume grief—anchoring spatial choreography cleanly. No credibility strain; atmospheric details are filtered through Elara’s professional eye without tourist overload.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>One deepening escalates cleanly: each loosened knot literally compresses the silence until the last fiber becomes an umbilical cord for the mask. Cost is visible—each spirit siphons a filament of starlight—but the tightening would hit harder if net mechanics (tension, fray, time) were shown rather than narrated. Still meets single-scene pressure standards.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme is emergent and non-declarative: grief transmuted into acoustic architecture reframes loss as breathable silence. Final image refuses tidy moral—the mask’s pulse is a quiet perpetual custodianship, not a victory lap—earning ambiguity with weighted afterglow. Subtext is carried by texture rather than lecture, though risk of symbolic overload if net=memory cliché were pushed further (it isn't).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, the prism sanctuary described with refractive syntax that enacts its subject (“muted colors settled like dust on the floor”). Selective compression and rhythmic variation persist under pressure; no unmotivated register drift. Proprioceptive hush is embodied, not abstract—every image vibrates at fingertip level through the needle.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence architecture is taut and varied; metaphor is coherent (hush as acoustic thread) and never labored. Occasional poetic redundancy—“the interlaced hush was not empty but full, a weight that pressed gently...”—is a scaffolder but brief enough to keep propulsion. No looped stems, punctuation stable, final line earns its slow exhale.</question>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mask-craft and psycho-audio exhumation fused into single ritual. Concept risks familiar ghost-knot trope yet is reweighted through tool-based silence-gathering. Refracted-star-sanctuary is a striking and specific space that would feel gimmicky if not woven into causality; here it constrains choices and reframes grief as acoustics, so transformation feels earned.</question>
