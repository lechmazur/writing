<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the poet’s “warmly attentive heart” is stated rather than embodied. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene; choices feel pre-ordained by theme. The final renunciation—“tending the incomplete is not mending but honoring”—is conceptually resonant yet lacks a felt, on-page cost. Characterization stays consistent but never surprises.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the poet’s stance crystallizes in the final image of the glowing feather, reweighting the premise. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned imagery and cadence shift carry the turn. Orientation is clear by line 3. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of incompleteness) rather than visceral, but legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly evoked—“cobalt lagoon after rain,” “amber light brushing the reeds”—and the feather-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy reflects the poet’s bias toward light and texture. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible positions. Environment subtly guides action: the feather placed on the lily steers the closing tableau.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harmonizing wind and water through verse—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each stanza thickens the “woven dawns” motif until the surface stills. No visible price is paid; the conflict remains aesthetic rather than urgent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the feather settles, but agency is observational.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in incompleteness emerges organically from the poet’s acts and images. Subtext is carried by the drifting feather and mirrored sky. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Complexity is present, but the lack of tangible cost keeps it from the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and textured—“salt air settle like a gentle sigh,” “burnished hush.” Syntax modulates with emotional rise. No dialogue; focalization stays tight. Occasional elevated diction (“fragment of woven dawns”) risks register drift but feels motivated by the poet’s sensibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is musical and dense; some metaphor strings verge on purple—“tapestry that resembled woven dawns”—yet pattern is taught early and paid off. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm supports the accumulative design. One mixed metaphor (“kite string snaps…melds with the lagoon’s pulse”) slightly blurs physics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Premise is familiar—solitary artist communes with nature—but the synthesis of feather, lagoon, and “woven dawns” feels specific. Transformation test: the emotional arc would collapse if the feather were generic. Risk lies in the lyric mode itself; it succeeds without gimmickry.</comment>
