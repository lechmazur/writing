<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lia’s interiority is vivid—her “brightly attentive” stance is embodied in micro-choices like fabricating the tribute and deliberately letting the lie spread. The shift from abstract curiosity to custodial vow carries visible cost: she accepts perpetual guardianship of the hidden corridors. Flaw is subtle but present: her readiness to deceive the network mirrors the crew’s own gambit, compounding risk. The final renunciation (open-ended custodianship) is earned and forecloses rest.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive’s silence is re-priced into living presence. Causal chain holds—fabricated post → algorithmic scatter → breadcrumb trail → checksum unlock → resurrected logs. One transition (vault door) is clean. Cost is legible in Lia’s new, unending responsibility. Lens is Causal; each beat narrows options toward the final stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The amber-glow server rooms, obsolete-emoji wall, and rusted rack are selective, tactile, and constrain movement. The hoodie patch reappears with reweighted meaning in the ‘Patch Origin’ file, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift. Environment guides choice—only the archive’s hidden sublayer yields the logs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the lost crew’s voice—is signaled early and tightens when Lia risks network censure by seeding the lie. One decisive turn: she chooses to perpetuate the deception, trading anonymity for resurrection of the logs. Cost is the permanent custodial burden. Pressure escalates under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of absence-into-presence emerges organically from the crew’s metadata gambit and Lia’s custodial vow. Subtext lives in the echoing deleted songs and the patch’s whispered code. Final message reweights the premise without moralizing: silence was never empty. Complexity is honored—the network is both grave and cradle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—archivist precision fused with lyrical mourning (“hum of forgotten data like distant choir”). POV stays tightly anchored to Lia; no head-hop. Compression and elision (“she compiled the data…”) are taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates with tension, accelerating during the checksum chase.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances. “Phantom breadcrumb” and “digital afterlife” are fresh without purple drift. Mechanics are clean; pronouns and tense stable. Final line crystallizes the reconfiguration with quiet power.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Premise fuses cold-case procedural with digital metaphysics in a non-obvious way. The checksum-as-social-metadata gambit feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (lost starship, ghost data) are transformed through Lia’s custodial ethics. Specificity of obsolete emojis and amber server glow anchors the speculative frame. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
