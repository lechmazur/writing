<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interiority is evocative but leans toward poetic summary rather than embodied contradiction; the “promise to the stillness” is the only micro-choice with visible cost, and even that is abstract. No second character appears, so relationship crucible is N/A. Traits remain consistent, but the arc feels more symbolic than psychologically earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the emerald’s flare crystallizes the stake and the aurora’s dimming signals cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and cadence shift reweight meaning. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Skyborne grotto, moonstone slab, and aurora ribbons are vivid, selective, and integrated into action; the emerald chip itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy aligns with POV priorities. Environment subtly guides choice—cold wind and fading light pressure the ritual timing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“capture the last spark before oblivion”—is signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each brushstroke tightens the lattice until the emerald flares; the aurora’s fade is the felt cost. No external reversals, but the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing light within inevitable dark emerges through concrete ritual, not statement. Subtext resides in the silence and the static’s hidden order. Final image reweights premise without moralizing. Complexity is present but leans toward elegy rather than contradiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet disciplined; perceptual signature is consistent—“radiant hush,” “trembling aurora,” “static hum” recur with purpose. Syntax modulates with emotional crests. No dialogue, so no register clash. Elision is taught early and paid off in the final flare.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“threshold of stillness,” “conceptual repricing”) stays within POV’s ceremonial register. Rhythm breathes with ritual pacing. Minor over-description in mid-section but never at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Premise—beautician-mortician harvesting auroral light into a chip—feels fresh and specific. Tropes of last-light-before-apocalypse are transformed through tactile ritual detail. Synthesis of mortuary and cosmetic craft is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
