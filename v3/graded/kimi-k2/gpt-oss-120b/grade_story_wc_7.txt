<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—tasting memories in broth, whispering to vines—yet her contradictory impulses (hope vs. ruin) remain mostly parallel rather than colliding in-scene; the final smile feels earned but the cost is more conceptual than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse pulses amber, the city’s lullabies now live in neural foliage, and Mara’s “gentle rebellion” forecloses the old world’s silence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each sensory layer tightens the pattern until the final image reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is no backdrop; its groaning arches and salt-bruised panes actively constrain Mara’s fire, kettle placement, and the vines’ reach. Final amber glow charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grow a garden of renewal—tightens once when the seed must sprout before alignment ends. Agency is clear: Mara’s pruning and tasting drive escalation; cost is the city’s memories she must metabolize, felt in the final inhale of “old stories.”</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-through-memory emerges organically from broth, vines, and spores; no moralizing. The closing image of a humming garden offers a non-literal answer to how beauty can rise from ruin, reweighting earlier decay.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined: synesthetic diction (“taste of childhood, loss, and hope”) and rhythmic control mirror Mara’s chef-perception. No head-hopping; every metaphor is filtered through her palate. Compression in the final cadence tightens the pulse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers sensory data and stakes. Occasional stacked metaphors (“rusted greenhouse stood like a scar… bruised by time”) flirt with overwriting yet serve the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; momentum breathes with the alignment’s rise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: memory-tasting chef + synaptic botany + celestial alignment feels inevitable in hindsight. The greenhouse-as-neural-cradle reframes eco-collapse and hope without cliché. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final amber pulse.</comment>
