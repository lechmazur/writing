<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maelia’s contradictory impulses—gentle speech against reckless action—are embodied in the soot-line pressed into the root; the final amber thread is earned by prior pacts and visibly costs her the card’s ash. Interiority stays concrete, but “holes in her soul” edges toward stock phrasing, slightly blunting specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the burned card dissolves into amber conduit, reweighting the bargain so destinies are shared stitches, not zero-sum trades. Causal chain holds—each sigil and soot line tightens the orchard’s response—though the orchard’s agency is lightly anthropomorphized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard’s half-lit corridors and bone-caught roots constrain every step; the hollow among vertebrae becomes the micro-setting that hosts the decisive act. Sensory detail is selective—luminescent ink, chill seeping—anchoring POV without cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—filling her inner void by bartering futures—tightens when the amber thread visibly binds both giver and receiver, foreclosing pure self-repair. One clear escalation beat: the root’s shiver after the soot seal shows cost is real and rising.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of mutual restoration emerges from the orchard’s sigh and amber conduit, not from stated morals. The final image reweights the premise: destinies are threads, not coins, achieving Conceptual Repricing without didacticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet controlled; diction like “dusky resolve” and “catacomb orchard” feels character-bound. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences in discovery, clipped rise at the end—maintaining coherent POV throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is patterned early and paid off. No loops or scaffold; occasional elevated phrasing (“ossified bones like dark veins”) stays within the established register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The tarot-ash-to-amber transformation of a destiny-bartering pact inside a bone-root orchard is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Risky lyric compression succeeds because the closure image remains legible and charged.</comment>
