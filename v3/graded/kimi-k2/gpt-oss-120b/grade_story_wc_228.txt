<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is painterly and specific, but the “intimate aloofness” label is asserted more than embodied; the final choice to keep the secret is credible yet the cost feels abstract rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing shells crystallize the promise and reconfigure the painter’s stance; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, though the cave detour’s causality is lightly coincidental.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Quay, cave, and studio are vividly sketched; the painted chest and glowing shells act as micro-settings that constrain the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping the secret of temporary eternity—tightens once when the key is found; the cost is felt in the renunciation of sharing, though pressure is more lyrical than acute.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of art as vessel for arrested time emerges organically; the final canvas-within-canvas image reweights the premise without moralizing, achieving quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is painterly, rhythmic, and consistent; sensory diction (“salty wind,” “melancholy blues”) is character-specific and sustains the lyric mode without opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; occasional stacked metaphors (“brushstrokes of a tempest”) flirt with overwriting but do not stall momentum or cloud closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Familiar quest-for-eternity arc is refreshed through the painter’s idiosyncratic process and the glowing-shell conceit; the synthesis feels inevitable rather than gimmicky.</comment>
