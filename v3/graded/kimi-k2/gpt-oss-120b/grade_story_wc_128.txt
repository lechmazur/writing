<comment>Mara’s interiority shows both profit-driven instinct and authentic mercy in early beats; her silent ledger vow under the skylight crystallizes her arc. She endures no visible physical cost, but her final Charged Poise on the lighthouse balcony visibly costs her the safety of emotional detachment. Internal contradictions (“cautious exuberance”) animate her choices rather than summary labels. One minor slip: status dialogue with the keeper remains generic, diluting the relational crucible.</comment>

<comment>Cumulative closure—Charged Poise from the returned locket reconfigures communal memory while preserving the open future. Causality arcs from misdelivery → shared ledger → library ceremony; every beat depends on the preceding. Orientation holds: library-skylight, pier, lighthouse are anchored by ~120 words. Closure does not reset stakes; they simply crystallize with felt communal cost.</comment>

<comment>Atlantic salt scent, lantern glow, and skylight starlight filter through Mara’s broker eye for value. Pier and lighthouse space track cleanly across bodies and objects. No single setting element locks a choice, but the recurring lighthouse balcony becomes the charged final frame. Minor generic “coastal town night” blur keeps score under 8.8.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake emerges quickly: “lift silent contributors.” Pressure deepens each time Mara must choose between commerce and community memory. The micro turn—fishermen arrive with sardines—widens the compassion cycle without resetting it. No visible personal cost is dramatized on Mara herself, limiting escalation scale.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Compassion as community cargo emerges through the ceremony image rather than assertion. The locket is a quiet icon, its final shine a non-literal answer to how loss circulates. Subtext avoids tidy moral; ambiguity between private mourning and public sharing lingers. Final paragraph verges on thematic echo but pulls back in the closing breath.</question>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Distinct maritime diction—“breath stirring scented pages,” “cataloguing the sighs of ships”—creates a signature coastal lyric. POV holds single third-person intimate through Mara’s selective noticing. No filter chains; syntax ebbs with scene tempo. Dialogue is minimal yet voice-driven: lighthouse keeper’s lantern greeting feels lived-in and unrepeatable.</question>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is smooth, readable, largely free of scaffold, though occasional elevated register (“resonant reconfiguration”) drifts slightly above character lexicon. Near-closure run of sentence-length variation heightens breathless hope. One paraphrase-loop pair (“quiet surge,” “quiet hope”) mild artifact; does not blur closure image.</question>

<grade>7.8</question>
<comment>The misdelivery trope is refreshed by literal maritime cargo culture and ledger ethics. Seamless synthesis: broker compassion as freight logistics. Final lighthouse gift circle feels inevitable yet not over-designed. Mild risk: sentiment tips toward sweetness but stays grounded in salty specificity; earns the uplift.</question>
