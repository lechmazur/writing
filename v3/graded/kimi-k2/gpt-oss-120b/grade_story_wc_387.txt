<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied, but the philosopher’s choices remain largely observational; the “mending” of memory is symbolic rather than dramatized, so the felt cost is muted. Motivation is clear—appreciation of hidden effort—but never collides with a contradictory impulse that forces a visible trade-off. The final promise to return reads as continuation, not renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise: the world “seemed stitched together,” a conceptual repricing that reweights the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases until the final image. However, the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the reader feels the shift but not the sting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The parapet, rain-slick stones, and fireflies are vividly filtered through the philosopher’s perceptual bias; the bamboo whisk functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Spatial choreography is coherent, and weather affects footing and mood. The environment never quite becomes an active obstacle, keeping it just shy of 8.0+ integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to perceive hidden effort—escalates through pattern recognition rather than external pressure. One tightening occurs when the philosopher resolves to mend memory, but the cost is symbolic; no live option is foreclosed. Escalation is textural, not causal, yet coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the accretion of images: unseen labor, threads, nets, fireflies. The final reconfiguration—“a testament to the quiet perseverance of all who work unseen”—offers resonant non-moralizing closure. Subtext is carried by gesture and silence; no thematic statement intrudes late.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, controlled, and consistent; perceptual signature is distinct (“loom of thoughts,” “demure audacity”). Patterned elision is taught early and paid off in the final whistle-echo. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains within the philosopher’s contemplative lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and musical; occasional stacked modifiers (“scintillatingly somber rhythm”) flirt with overwriting but stay purposeful. No loops or paraphrase clutter. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure; final paragraph slows into cadence. One typo—“net listening for the pull”—slips through.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fusion of net-mending, tea-whisk loom, and firefly semaphore feels fresh and inevitable. Risk is taken in the lyric, accumulative structure, but it remains legible. The transformation test passes: the story would collapse if the philosopher were any other artisan.</comment>
