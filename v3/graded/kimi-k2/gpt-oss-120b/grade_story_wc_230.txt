<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s rational truffle-forager identity is vivid, but her “involuntary truthfulness” is asserted rather than dramatized; the interior contradiction between honesty and smuggling is stated, not embodied in micro-choices. The final decision to use the eye as communal mirror is earned by prior motive, yet the cost feels abstract rather than viscerally paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the eye’s concealment and communal unveiling reconfigure the orchard’s social contract with a Charged Poise. Causal chain holds—storm, moss seal, smugglers’ silence—though the “empathy virus” backstory is more atmospheric than functional to this beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The hanging orchard is rendered with tactile specificity—slick bark, brine, leaf-dust—each detail constraining movement and mood. The glass eye’s glimmer under storm-light charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turning private grief into shared spectacle—tightens once when Mara seals the eye; the smugglers’ greed is checked by their own reflection. One meaningful deepening, cost legible in their silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of communal truth emerges from the orchard’s storm-battered reciprocity, not exposition. Final image of “psychological safety” as shared spectacle reweights prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, truffle-forager’s perceptual bias consistent—“mossy roots,” “mushroom’s spore”—with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional figurative excess (“broken cathedral of fruit”) is pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold; final paragraph crystallizes without clutter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of post-viral empathy, smuggled relic, and orchard ecology feels inevitable. Risk in turning honesty into communal mirror pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
