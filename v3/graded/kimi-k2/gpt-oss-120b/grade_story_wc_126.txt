<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Violinist’s interiority is vivid—she “feels vibrations through the damp earth”—but her decisive act (bow lifted to unbind silence) is more ritual gesture than costly choice; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, so the Earned Stasis feels slightly pre-ordained rather than wrestled with.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chronic hush is “transformed into a gentle hum” with visible communal effect. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each added note thickens the air until the final chord reweights the orchard’s silence. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass greenhouse “flickering with the last embers of a rainforest” and shipwrecks “resonating with the chronic hush” are selective, sensory, and thematically charged; the setting constrains the acoustic stakes and mirrors the final re-tuning of silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—beauty wrested from unfinished ruin—is signaled early and tightened when the bowl’s vibration “collects the note and the tale alike,” foreclosing pure silence. Cost is communal and atmospheric rather than personal, but legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of beauty-in-incompletion emerges through concrete particulars (charcoal roots, swaying vines) and the final image of the bowl “reflecting the stars,” offering non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled third-person hovers close to the violinist’s acoustic perception; diction (“seed sprouting in ash”) is character-specific, rhythm modulates with the melody’s rise, and no head-hop occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned early and paid off (“chronic hush” → “gentle hum”). No loops or mixed metaphors; occasional elevated diction stays within the violinist’s sensibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Post-apocalyptic orchard concert with sound-collecting bowl feels fresh; the synthesis of shipwrecks, rainforest ash, and communal storytelling is specific and inevitable in hindsight, though the risk level is moderate.</comment>
