<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; her contradictory impulses (yearning vs. renunciation) are stated rather than embodied in micro-choice. The final “quiet joy” is felt but not paid for by an on-page forfeiture. Secondary character Lio appears only as witness, adding no crucible pressure. Backstory is anchored to present stimuli and tilts stance, satisfying BRR.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the runaway dream becomes shared light, reconfiguring the archipelago’s communal longing. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each sunrise photograph layers density until the final image reweights stakes. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props. One felt cost: the dream’s physical absence persists even as its light returns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The lighthouse library, watercolor palette, and reef sunrise are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains Mara's choices (palette’s fading pigments limit color range; dawn’s narrow window dictates timing). Spatial choreography is coherent; objects are handled on-page. The “whispering archipelago” remains slightly generic postcard, preventing 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the palette’s light must meet sunrise in a single irreversible moment. Agency is present (Mara presses shutter), but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. Coincidence (Lio’s synchronous epiphany) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of longing-as-light emerges organically from palette, photographs, and shared filament; no explicit moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and scent of jasmine. Final image reweights prior material without statement. Slight drift toward poetic abstraction keeps it from 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrically consistent, with perceptual signature (“luminous absence,” “cipher of longing”) that modulates under pressure. No dialogue; no head-hopping. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Register remains elevated but coherent to Mara's librarian-poet stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical; occasional stacked metaphors (“tide spilling into a hidden cove”) risk overwriting but stay legible. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm accelerates with sunrise beat. One mixed metaphor (“heartbeat of the archipelago”) slightly dulls peak clarity. Line-level artifacts do not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes (lighthouse librarian, magical palette) through specific sensory and emotional detail. Transformation test passes: story would collapse without palette-light-photography nexus. Risk-taking in lyric structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Slight echo of “merchant’s pearl” folktale keeps it from 9+.</comment>
