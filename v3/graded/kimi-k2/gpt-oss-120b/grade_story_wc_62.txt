<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliam’s interiority is vivid—his “fiercely meditative river” mind and embodied shivering of stone—but the shift from passive observer to active carver is more asserted than dramatized; the final carving choice lacks a visible, on-page cost that would foreclose an alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ribbon-etched heart gravestone reweights collective grief into flowing tapestry; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but the cost (Eliam’s relinquishment of prior methods) is implied rather than shown on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s cracked panes, metallic jasmine air, and spiral of stones anchor every beat; the setting constrains Eliam’s movements and literally shapes the grief-map, charging the final image when rainwater glides over the ribbon heart.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping collective grief—is signaled early; pressure tightens as butterflies converge and ribbons unwind, forcing Eliam to translate pattern into stone. The cost is diffuse but legible in the town’s shared mourning ritual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as migratory pattern rather than wound. The final gravestone’s singing hum offers a non-literal answer that reweights earlier motifs without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric, textured prose sustains a consistent meditative POV; sensory diction (“humid sigh,” “metallic tang”) is character-filtered. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Strong rhythmic control and high information density; occasional stacked metaphors (“flock of butterflies that fluttered through the years”) flirt with overwriting but never obscure causality or dull the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: gravestone carver, spectral mentor, butterfly migration, and grief-mapping cohere into a singular vision. The risk of lyric accumulation pays off in the resonant final image.</comment>
