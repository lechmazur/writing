<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her barefoot chill and “technically gentle” touch reveal vocation and temperament—but the forgiveness arc is asserted rather than dramatized; the shift from doubt to resolve is too smooth, lacking visible contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the reconfigured rope’s luminous map and the traveler’s arrival form a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights memory from private to communal. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each name reclaimed tightens the tapestry. Cost is felt in the perpetual return Mara accepts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>The sanctum’s ice, aurora, and copper cylinder are tactile constraints—cold floor numbs feet, thawing veins guide re-weaving—charging the final image. Selective sensory detail (pine-resin scent, frost glow) integrates with action rather than cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and escalates through each loop of rope; the act of re-weaving narrows options (rope must be sacrificed to its new pattern) and exacts the cost of perpetual vigilance. Agency remains with Mara throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-thaw emerges organically from copper glow and snowmelt ardor; no explicit moralizing. The final auroral curtain reweights the premise: remembrance is not archival but a living warmth that can melt any heart.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise—“snowmelt ardor,” “aurora’s green tide”—consistent with a caster’s tactile precision. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains anchored in Mara’s sensorium. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; metaphors (rope as serpent, frost as sunrise) serve rather than stall. Occasional lyrical surplus (“ribbons of light”) flirts with overwriting but never clouds causality or the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Fusing lost-wax craft with auroral ice-library is fresh; the ceremonial rope as living punch-card memory feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity of reindeer-sinew braid and copper runes grounds the fantastical frame.</comment>
