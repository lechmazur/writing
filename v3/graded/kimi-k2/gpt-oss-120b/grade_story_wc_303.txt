<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied; the mulberry ache anchors her choices. The telepathic bond with vines and the coffee-stain divination are specific, character-bound abilities that alter tactics. The final renunciation—choosing the vines’ dissent—carries visible cost as the envoy lowers his sword and the empire yields. Only the envoy’s abrupt empathy feels slightly under-motivated, keeping it from 9.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the floating city rises free, the empire shares iron, and the promise’s glow returns—cost is the envoy’s mulberry ache and Elara’s lingering grief. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of vine-brightening and coffee-ring readings tightens stakes until the final chord reweights destiny. Orientation is clear within 120 words. One micro-turn suffices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The velvet observatory, brass telescope, and creeping vines form a micro-setting that constrains choice: the vines literally whisper tactics and later become the city’s foundation. Sensory detail is selective—amber lamps, frost-laden chord—filtered through Elara’s archival gaze. Spatial choreography holds as she aligns violin with coffee rings beneath the dome. Environment charges the final image without clutter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—dream versus empire—is signaled early and tightens through the dimming promise’s glow. Escalation is textured: each coffee ring and violin note narrows options until the envoy’s stance crystallizes. Cost is the empire’s partial surrender and Elara’s personal grief. No reversal beyond the single decisive act, fitting the length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the weight of archives against living growth, the price of autonomy. Subtext lives in the vines’ wordless protest and the envoy’s lowered sword. Final image—the skyward garden rooted in whispering vines—reweights the premise without moralizing. Mulberry ache lingers as unresolved emotional cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature rooted in provenance research—“lattice of archives,” “provenance of the ice crystal violin.” Syntax modulates with pressure: longer cadences for reflection, clipped fragments at the envoy’s decision. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight to Elara. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual when the envoy’s eyes fill with shared ache.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and stakes. Metaphors are controlled—“perforated destiny,” “mulberry ache”—and avoid purple drift. No loops or scaffold; information is compressed without loss of clarity. Final chord’s “frost-laden” resonance crystallizes earlier motifs cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes—prophetic artifact, telepathy, floating city—into a fresh lattice anchored by archival specificity and plant rebellion. The ice violin’s cold resonance and coffee-stain cartography feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric compression pays off in the final image. No derivative echoes.</comment>
