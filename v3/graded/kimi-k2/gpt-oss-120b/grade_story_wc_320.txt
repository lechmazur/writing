<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Selin's interiority is vivid and embodied ("treated whispers of starlight as practical maps"), but the shift from skeptical interpreter to trusting engineer feels slightly smoothed; the cost of abandoning linear-time assumptions is asserted rather than dramatized in body or risk. Micro-choices (climbing, slotting the shard, whispering intent) are specific, yet the emotional contradiction between data discipline and wonder could be sharper under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the chord broadcast rewrites the city’s decay into genesis, with the moonlit gorge as visible cost. Causal chain—perigee → shard → chord → rebirth—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat layers density until the final cadence. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The rusted tower, quantum coil, and violet shard form a micro-setting that directly constrains every move; the gorge’s hollows echo the chord, charging the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“cables humming with forgotten frequencies”). Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—turn ending into beginning—is signaled early and tightened once: the shard’s re-tuning forecloses nostalgic interpretation and forces a live broadcast with irreversible civic consequence. Cost is visible in the flickering power banks and the villagers’ awed emergence. Agency is Selin’s alone; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: every conclusion seeds genesis, voiced through the chord’s echo rather than statement. The shard’s shift from relic to living key reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image of dawn-lit platforms offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question>
<comment>Voice is textured, lyrical yet disciplined—Selin’s “pragmatic hands” and “disciplined mind” modulate syntax under pressure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (“serenely electric glow” filtered through her signal-trained gaze). Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the closing cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers signal, body, and city. Metaphors are coherent (“spiral stairwell like a comet’s tail”) and never stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; information density is high without overwriting. Minor elevated diction (“overture,” “Genesis in Echo”) fits the celestial frame.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</question>
<comment>The synthesis of celestial signal craft, rusted post-industrial decay, and Hollywood myth feels fresh and inevitable. The shard of hush transforms a familiar trope (lost star relic) into a living conduit for civic rebirth. Risky lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
