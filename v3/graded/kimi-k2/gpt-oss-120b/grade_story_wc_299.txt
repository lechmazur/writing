<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ex-roadie’s loss-direction-parallels are specific, embodied, and culminate in a quiet stasis—no false resolution. Emotions thrum (van, cloth, clatter) so interiority stays character-bound. One flaw: “confidently uncertain” surfaces as prompt echo rather than lived contradiction mid-scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the echo valley reframes “after the applause” toward purpose, cost paid in self-reckoning. Lens holds Accumulative/Textural—images layer until the final amber cadence tightens. One drift: “ledger lesson” edges toward exposition, blunting the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quarry’s thrum, rust-flecked van, and slow amber dust are vivid and selective; they supply tactile pressure (sound of crushers mirrors cymbal crash) that charges the ending image. Only lapse: early orientation wavers for ~50 words before trailer door anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>One dominant stake—purpose after public shame—escalates until the final re-weighing; no reversals, but the tightening beat (ledger entry) forecloses former self-image. Cost is felt, causal pressure aligns with lens. Coincidence remains inert rather than resolving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the cloth’s faded fibers and valley echoes, not thesis talk; final shift from hollow ring to purpose-found resonates without sermon. Complexity held—no tidy moral. One half-step: “the true stage...” slightly announces theme, not earns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Tight, musical diction; sensory echoes knit rhythm. Faint voice leaks with “confidently uncertain” and “tarnished brass compass” therapy cadence, but not fatal. No POV drift—first-person stays coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Sentences vary, dense with image. One mixed metaphor: “dust rose like a slow sunrise” yet still legible. Minor synonym loops (reverberate, resonance, echo) but not pervasive. Clean prose.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of touring grit and antiques appraisal yields rare viewpoint. Slight familiarity of quarry-as-conscience could be fresher, yet specifics keep it above template. Bold choice of quiet over fireworks.</comment>
