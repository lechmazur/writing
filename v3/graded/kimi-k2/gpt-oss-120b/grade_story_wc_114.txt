<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mirela’s interior contradiction—seeking certainty while smudging data—drives every beat; the swallowed-lie memory and final resolve carry visible cost. Fever-break clarity and “auroral sorrow” are embodied, not labeled. Micro-choice to adjust the barometer by a fraction crystallizes her hierarchy of values. The arc earns its quiet renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: smudges accumulate pattern until the console reading reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—truth’s weight felt in the stabilized number and lifted cloud. Orientation is anchored by dawn, station, console within 120 words. No causality breaks; cost is legible in the final breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mountain station, rusted panels, antennae swaying like vines—environment constrains the barometer tweak and mirrors internal sway. Botanical illustration doubles as data sheet and emotional map, charging the final folded-tucked image. Sensory hierarchy (hiss of heater, thin air) filters through Mirela’s fever-cleared perception. Micro-setting (glass, ink, skin heat) guides the decisive smudge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—measuring the swallowed truth—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: smudging the illustration until humidity gradient yields a number that forecloses doubt. Cost is the felt weight shifting from chest to cloud. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no external coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth’s fluidity emerges from ink, weather data, and bodily fever without once naming it. Final image—folded, stained illustration glowing faintly—reweights the premise wordlessly. Subtext in antennae sway and barometer tremor avoids abstraction. No moralizing; sorrow modulates into quiet resolve.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric texture: “bruised gold,” “auroral sorrow,” “thin veil” remain anchored in Mirela’s perceptual bias. Syntax breathes with fever-lag then tightens during smudge sequence. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays intimate. Compression taught early (“the moment after fever breaks”) and paid off in final line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; each sentence layers sensorium and data. No loops or scaffold; “swaying certainties” refrain is pattern-taught. Metaphors (ink as humidity, antennae as vines) stay coherent. Rhythm accelerates during barometer tweak, then exhales on the deck.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: oracle-as-botanist, data encoded in chlorophyll ink, truth weighed by humidity gradient. Risky lyric mode commits fully and lands closure. No derivative templates; mountain station feels singular. Transformation test fails if relocated—details are irreplaceable.</comment>
