<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The exorcist’s guilt and need to apologize are vivid, but interiority drifts into lyrical abstraction (“imperfect miracles trembling like loose pages”) that blurs concrete motive. No second character on page, so relationship crucible is absent; pressure is purely internal. Micro-choices (arranging torn pages, whispering the apology) are present yet feel symbolic rather than tactical; cost is atmospheric, not embodied. Earned stasis is credible, but emotional contradiction is stated more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the apology rides the wind with a blue glow, a resonant reconfiguration under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is loose—perfume currents act like magic—but pattern is taught early and holds. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty. One meaningful tightening when the sheet flutters down. Cost is conceptual yet legible: she accepts the orchard’s fall as price. No teleporting props or plot amnesia.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sheet-music archive, piano, perfume bottle, and orchard form a tight micro-setting cluster; bottle and piano constrain the ritual beats. Sensory detail is selective—lily scent, pine, amber glass—filtered through POV. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Weather (thin autumn breath) mirrors hush without overt symbolism. Archive itself becomes conductive wood, charging the final image; meets 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver apology before trees fall—is signaled early; orchard clock tightens atmosphere but never alters tactical options on page. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal; no visible price paid until conceptual cost at end. Single deepening when apology sheet descends; no reversal. Agency is ritual, not strategic; escalation is lyrical density, not option reduction. Sufficient for short lyric mode but thin for 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of apology as imperfect miracle emerges through image (broken mirror circle, cracked saint) rather than statement. Subtext operates in scent and sound; no final moralizing. Conceptual repricing at end reweights gossip-as-ash without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: forgiveness remains a broken chord. One thematic echo mid-story is earned; no tidy binary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV stays tight to exorcist; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature—music-as-metaphor, perfume-as-current—held throughout. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadence in ritual, clipped whisper at end. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet waived. Free indirect slips are clean; diction stays within lexicon of lyrical practitioner. Meets 9+ quick test.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; no synonym churn or template cadence. Mixed metaphors (“ghostly fingers threaded through the score”) are brief and coherent. One paraphrase loop (“imperfect miracle” repeated in adjacent clauses) costs −0.2. Density high; every sentence advances image or stakes. No artifacts in final third. Register stable; minor lily/ash echo could be trimmed but doesn’t dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Gossip-column exorcist is fresh synthesis; perfume-as-conduit and sheet-music archive spark new angle on apology tale. Tropes of orchard-fall and broken mirror are transformed through scent-music ritual. Risky lyric structure pays off in Charged Poise. Specificity anchors universals; removal of any core element would collapse logic. Not quite 9+ because premise combo feels clever rather than inevitable.</comment>
