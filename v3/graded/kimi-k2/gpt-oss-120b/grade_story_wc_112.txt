<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her mechanically warm hands, measured heartbeat, and quiet smile anchor her—but the “prove time moves sideways” motive is asserted more than dramatized; no contradictory impulse tests it under pressure. The final choice (pulling the lever) is causally earned yet the cost is diffuse—an “icy warmth” rather than a forfeiture she visibly feels. Still, her obliging nature threads through micro-choices (calibrating turbines, whispering to birds), keeping her individualized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sideways slip of time is made legible by the unfurling alien flora and the birds’ slow ascent, with conceptual cost—the station’s reality is now subtly altered. Causal chain holds: lever → magnetic surge → holographic lattice bend → temporal nudge. Orientation is clear by line 5; no teleporting props. Minor ellipsis in how glyphs “pulse” is accepted under lyric compression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The station breathes: humming turbines, bioluminescent vines, silent aviary—all filtered through Lira’s mechanic gaze. Frosted clouds, icy warmth, and amber arcs create sensory hierarchy keyed to her task. The magnetic nexus itself constrains the final choice, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question>
<comment>Dominant stake—demonstrate sideways time—is signaled early and tightened once: the lever pull forces a live test with irreversible floral awakening. Cost is conceptual (reality skew) rather than visceral, but legible. Agency is hers; coincidence only complicates. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</question>
<comment>Theme of temporal non-linearity emerges through the flora’s unfurling and the birds’ silent arcs, never sermonized. The final image—station breathing in “quiet, subdued awakenings”—reweights the premise without moral. Subtext lives in gesture: Lira’s whisper to the birds carries more than dialogue could. Avoids tidy binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question>
<comment>Voice is distinct: tactile, lyrical, mechanically precise—“mechanically warm,” “icy glow,” “violin bow on frozen strings.” POV stays tight to Lira; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short pulses during lever pull, longer breaths in aviary stillness. Compression is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</question>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is selective and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or action. Occasional elevated diction (“temporal drift,” “conceptual repricing”) fits the speculative register. Clean grammar, strong verbs, no mixed metaphors. Final line lands with crystalline cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</question>
<comment>Premise—sideways time proven by alien flora under a mechanic’s hand—feels fresh, synthesized through grounded detail rather than gimmick. Risky lyric compression is sustained without clarity loss. Transformation test: could not swap flora or lever without breaking arc. Specificity of glyphs, holographic lattice, and aviary silence anchors universals.</comment>
