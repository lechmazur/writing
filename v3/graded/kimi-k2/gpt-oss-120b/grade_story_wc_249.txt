<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is vivid—her “quietly rebellious” hum and drumming embody motive—but the shift from defiance to communal conduit is asserted more than dramatized; the final beat lacks a visible cost to her personally.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s song reweights the lab’s protocol. Accumulative lens holds—each drumbeat layers density until the cosmos “exhales resolve.” Cost is diffuse but legible in the abandoned protocol.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The sound-wave garden is not mere backdrop; its vibrating blossoms and auric lagoon actively respond to Lira’s drumming, constraining and enabling her final chorus. Sensory specificity is selective and purposeful, charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—turn sterile observation into shared dream—tightens through escalating drumbeats that force the staff’s dream-intrusion. One clear intensification suffices; coincidence is avoided.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme of sorrow birthing light emerges organically from the garden’s luminous orbs and the lab’s abandoned cruelty. Final auroral veil offers non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Lyric, textured voice sustains a guinea-pig perceptual signature—tiny paws, whiskered cheek—without head-hop. Rhythm modulates with emotional swell; patterned elision (“hush of the universe inhaling”) is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats. Occasional elevated diction (“auric lagoon”) fits the lyric register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Familiar lab-animal trope is transformed through synesthetic world-building and guinea-pig-as-orchestrator conceit. Synthesis feels inevitable; risk in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
