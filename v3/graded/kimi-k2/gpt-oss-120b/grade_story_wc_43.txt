<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is embodied and consistent, but her “decisively kind” trait is asserted more than dramatized; the final chord lands as earned renunciation yet the cost feels generalized rather than personally specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Mara’s lullaby crystallizes the goodbye with felt communal cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, though the broken-vinyl payoff is slightly late to fully charge the image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The radiant haven is sketched with selective, synesthetic detail; the vinyl fragment and harp strings function as micro-setting that constrains the final ritual, but the broader cloud-hospice rules remain lightly anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guiding Mr. Harlan’s final breath—is signaled early; pressure tightens once through the deliberate slowing of chords, but escalation is more cadence shift than causal narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of wholeness-from-brokenness emerges organically from the vinyl motif and communal breathing; final image reweights the premise without moralizing, though the scent-of-hope concept edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric, hushed voice sustains a distinct perceptual signature; rhythmic control mirrors the slowing heartbeat; no head-hop or register drift, though occasional elevated phrasing (“pulsing stillness”) flirts with poetic inflation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; a few stacked metaphors (“shard of memory,” “scent of hope”) risk overwriting, but momentum never stalls; no loops or scaffold in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hospice ritual with cloud-top metaphysics; the broken-vinyl-as-reliquary feels inevitable in hindsight, though the premise flirts with familiar “music heals death” tropes.</comment>
