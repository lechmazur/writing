<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“calm fire that burned just enough to keep the cold at bay”), but her contradictory impulses remain largely parallel rather than simultaneous; the final renunciation feels earned yet the cost is more atmospheric than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lake’s “silver smile” crystallizes the shift from impatience to patience with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of moon arcs and magnetic pulses tightens to a single cadence shift. No orientation debt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and viaduct are rendered with tactile specificity; the brass compass and cracked ice constrain the final choice. Micro-setting (compass atop viaduct) charges the closing image, satisfying 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sculpt patience from impatience—is signaled early and tightened once when the magnetic surge forces alignment; the cost is the relinquishing of “restless yearning,” visible in the final breath. Escalation is modest but coherent under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from pattern: moon paths, magnetic pulses, and ice cracks all reweight toward patience. Final mantra “unyoke the rush, honor the still” is spoken aloud but earned by prior embodied experience, avoiding overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined, with rhythmic control that mirrors the protagonist’s restraint (“softly purposeful through the snow”). Perceptual signature is consistent; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet clear; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One minor loop—“patient revolution…slow uprising of patience”—but it occurs early and does not obscure closure. No artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Fusion of geomagnetic mysticism with interior discipline feels fresh; the “magnetic viaduct after rain” is not a stock image. Transformation test passes—story would collapse without this specific lattice and lake. Risk is restrained but coherent.</comment>
