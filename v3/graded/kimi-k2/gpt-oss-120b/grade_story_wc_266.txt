<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is lyrical but abstract; the “unused courage” motif is told more than embodied. The moment she presses the star-stamp to the chest latch is a clear micro-choice that crystallizes her arc, yet prior beats lack contradictory impulses on the page. Emotional embodiment drifts toward poetic label (“pulse of hope”) rather than specific bodily tension. Closure cost is felt but diffuse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira steps onto the ridgeway again, now carrying earned courage. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each indirect detour layers density until the cave map reweights the stake. Orientation is clear by line 3. The only drag is a soft causal link between the dog’s leash breaking and Mira’s decision; the leash feels symbolic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway, ferry lantern, and star-etched cave form a coherent micro-setting that constrains movement and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective—pebble pier, salt mist, lantern glow—filtered through Mira’s longing. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The lighthouse heartbeat is a fresh, specific anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding dormant courage—is signaled early and tightened when the map offers literal paths to it. Escalation is textural: each indirect route adds weight until the cave reconfigures options. Cost is conceptual (facing the self) rather than visceral, but legible. Agency rests with Mira at the latch moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of courage as buried seed emerges organically from the cave map image; no moralizing. The shoreline lullaby motif threads through beginning and end, reweighted from collective comfort to personal summons. Subtext is carried by the star stamp’s click echoing like a “distant bell.” Final image of sunrise on the ridgeway offers quiet, earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, consistent, and POV-locked; no head-hopping. Syntax modulates with emotional swell—long rolling sentences mirror the sea’s lullaby, then tighten at the latch click. Diction stays within Mira’s perceptual range. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual cost”) edges toward authorial intrusion but remains rare.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; a few stacked metaphors (“lantern glow like a lullaby weaving through mist”) flirt with overwriting but serve atmosphere. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm breathes with scene needs. One mixed metaphor—“darkness parted like a gentle tide”—slightly muddies physical logic, yet the line is isolated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The ferry-on-dream-ridgeway premise is familiar, but the star-stamp ticket punch as literal key to an inner map feels fresh and specific. Transformation test passes: the emotional arc depends on the stamp’s click and the cave’s map. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation over causal plot—but coherence holds.</comment>
