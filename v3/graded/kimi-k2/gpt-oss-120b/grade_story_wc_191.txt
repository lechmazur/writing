<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mina’s contradictory kernels—archive duty versus ascent ambition—embed in immediate tactile choices: the flake chosen over the codex, the throne chosen over lingering. The final kneel and extra flake placement mark Earned Stasis where her flaw of restless eras '-and-onward dreams exact the cost of perpetual stewardship. Embodied emotion peaks in the “circuitry across the horizon” without therapy-speak, though interiority once calls her “wisely adventurous” aloud, a minor border slip.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens observed: because Mina craves balance, therefore she quests, because she peels paint, therefore she finds the stairway, because she mounts the throne, therefore a “gentle hum of unity” reclaims the council seat. Closure delivers an undeniable Decisive Change—throne claimed via a second ruby flake, the orchard now rooted in the city’s data streams—whose cost is the lifelong lore-keeping promised on the page: “she vowed to record this tale.”</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The orchard’s shifting hues and holographic dew shape immediate visual tactics: peelable paint galleries unlock the stairway location; kaleidoscopic falls refract into pixel rain that charges the final ascendant vista. Detail stays economical—the corridor smells of “rain on metal” once—yet its mutable surfaces constrain every move; orchard roots physically interlock with city data streams at climax, satisfying the micro-setting gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stakes—“find the stair before sunrise”—compress options with each exfoliated layer. One clear tightening: mural sigil narrows infinite orchard paths to a single fissure. Cost is paid in seized time and ascending memories tugging sleeves, but sunrise also hard-boils into immediate digital gold code, shrinking every beat to a terminal cadence. Causal lens grants sufficient agency-driven escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—memory as the bridge between possibility and stewardship—emerges through successive ruby pulses and the double flake’s final act (balance of past and onward dreams). No explicit moral, only silent vista of “bloom data trees.” Final image reweights all earlier nostalgia into active custodianship. The “neon archives” refrain risks micro-echo diaglog but is absorbed by visuals.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mina’s perceptual signature is dense with synesthetic blends—fermented jasmine and silicon, circuitry sun. Syntax swells then contracts, matching rise to climax: “holographic dew glimmered… step resonated.” Compression in peak beats is practiced and taught from the start, yielding zero head-hop and consistent interior grammar. No dialogue means core voice untested against other registers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Read-aloud rhythm modulates without template echo; parallel tactile verbs (“echoed,” “shivered,” “sang”) serve patterned musicality rather than loop. High density lines—“spiral of crystal that rose into clouds. Each step resonated with a note of memory…”—advance goal, memory, theme simultaneously. Zero paraphrase loops, no mixed metaphors. One slipped abstract compound “future stretched like endless circuitry” slips under the elegance ceiling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Transposed crystal orchard as living archive, ruby flake as sovereign crypto-seed, and sunrise resetting to gold-violet code strands feel non-obvious yet inevitable. Combines portal-quest and data-futurism without familiar genre handholds. Inception of “duplicate flakes for balance” crystallizes a fresh inflection that erupts from prior motif.
