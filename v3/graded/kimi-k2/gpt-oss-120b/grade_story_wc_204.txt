<question>1</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Mara’s desire to compress eternity emerges clearly, but internal contradiction and micro-choice are reported, not scenically embodied in moment-to-moment bodily tension. Frost-spiral press slam is the single embodied beat; earlier decisions are narrated rather than dramatized. No credible cost is enacted—only described after the fact—so closure feels asserted, not earned.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s conversion into “living lattice.” Cost is asserted (books unfurling, clouds lettering), but the felt impact is more atmospheric than experiential. Pattern taught early, transitions clean. Weakness: rupture is presented as spectacle rather than causally tied to Mara’s pressing act; cause is implied rather than scenically legible.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Glass orchard and swirling clouds are vividly anchored; individual panes become portals, each a micro-setting that reframes the final image, fulfilling 9+ quick test. Density is selective—no list-style exposition; atmospheric detail advances rather than stalls.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake crystallizes quickly: destabilizing a “perfect system.” Mara’s agency drives escalation via frost-spiral press run, which triggers the rupture. Tight enough at short length.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Theme of negotiated permanence emerges through spiral motif, bottled whisper as catalyst, and lattice ending. Avoids explicit moralizing; image-driven resonance suffices to invite reflection without tidy message. Ambiguity remains purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Lush, dream-sharpened diction (“glass orchard library floated,” “ink‑stained fingertips traced hidden codes”) creates a coherent lyric texture that peaks at the spiralling lattice. Compression and hyphenated compounds read intentional, never slack.</question>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Prose ear is elegant; lines often layer jobs (description + foreshadowing). Minor loops (“each...each...each...”) are brief and pattern-taught rather than artifactual. No metaphor muddle, no scaffold paraphrase in high-pressure beats.</question>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Floating library as printing press compressing eternity is fresh synthesis. Risky magical-realist premise commits fully, avoids retreat. Transformation satisfies hindsight test: no near-derivative echoes detected, concept integrated rather than bolted on.</question>
