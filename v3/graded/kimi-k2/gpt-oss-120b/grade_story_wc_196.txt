<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Amelia’s interiority is textured and embodied (“trembling fingertips,” “quiet thrill”), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the shift from broken-hearted to “steadier” is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible cost. The button acts as an external catalyst, yet her final micro-choice—placing it on the blank file—reads more ritual than irreversible stance. Still, the specificity of her perceptual lens and the occupation-driven stakes keep her above stock.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lobby display crystallizes a new institutional stance, and Amelia’s quiet solidarity carries felt cost in her “broken but steadier” heart. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dust patterns and silhouettes accrue meaning until the final image reweights the premise. One minor causality wobble: the supervisor’s instant agreement softens the institutional pressure that the room had built.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The file room’s stale air, oak desk, and dust motes are filtered through Amelia’s archivist gaze; the button-as-lantern turns the setting into an active projector of memory. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves—and the micro-setting (dust, ledger, button) constrains her final gesture. A hairline slip: “summer after the emancipation” is vague temporal anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring forgotten children—tightens once when the supervisor agrees to display the button, foreclosing the option of continued neglect. The escalation is driven by Amelia’s curated evidence, not coincidence. Cost is present but diffuse: institutional change rather than personal loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Theme of unseen kindness emerging from bureaucratic erasure is woven through dust, silhouettes, and the button’s glow; no moralizing statement intrudes. The final image of the blank file and rising dust reweights the premise without sermon. A touch of sentimentality in “love still bright” keeps it from the top band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“hummed with the sigh of old vents,” “dust rose, eager to unfurl”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Amelia’s archivist diction colors every observation. No POV leakage or register drift; even the single line of dialogue fits the softening supervisor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. Minor loop: “unfurl” appears four times in close succession, a faint drumbeat. Otherwise clean syntax, strong verbs, no scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The foster-care-button-dust constellation feels fresh; the bureaucratic archive as magic-lantern is an unexpected synthesis. Risk is moderate—lyric accumulation rather than twist—but the payoff lands. No close echoes of famous scenes.</comment>
