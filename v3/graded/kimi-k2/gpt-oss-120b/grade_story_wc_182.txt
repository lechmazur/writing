<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Selene’s motive to “rescue unlearned knowledge” is stated early and her linguistic skill drives every beat; yet interiority stays abstract—no bodily fear, fatigue, or contradiction under pressure. The final choice to step through the portal is earned by prior causal chain, but the cost (leaving the mountain’s safety) is only implied, not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the library awakens and Selene commits to the next portal, a Charged Poise that reconfigures her future. Causal linkage holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens—each gap mapped, each chord heard tightens the pattern—though the time-traveler’s nod feels like an external stamp rather than earned consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The mountain-bookstore is gorgeously textured—stone cathedral, ivy lock, phosphorescent fungi—yet its geography occasionally floats; distances and levels blur between mezzanine, cavern, and chamber. The setting constrains choice when the floor gives way and the vines must be bargained with, charging the final image of the glass citadel beyond.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—“save knowledge never learned”—is signaled early and escalates through each discovered void; the tightening is intellectual rather than visceral. The final act of recording the portal’s coordinates in the diary forecloses Selene’s return path, but the price is more conceptual than palpable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge exists in the silence between catalogued certainties. The unheard symphony motif returns at the end as the mountain exhales, reweighting earlier musical metaphors without sermonizing. Subtext stays implicit—no character states the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent; diction (“stone cathedral,” “phosphorescent fungi”) feels filtered through a scholar-poet’s perception. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the final cadence. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is musical and dense; occasional stacked metaphors (“hollowed into a labyrinthine bookstore that swallowed whole caravans”) risk overwriting but never obscure causality. One paraphrase loop (“unheard symphony… unheard symphony”) is minor. Rhythm and sentence variety serve the mounting awe.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—rescuing knowledge that has never been learned—feels fresh, and the living bookstore-mountain is rendered with idiosyncratic specificity. Tropes (time traveler, secret library) are transformed through botanical linguistics and sonic indexing. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
