<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marin’s interiority is embodied and specific—her palm on stone, the “frost of her inner apathy”—but the arc from numbness to thaw is slightly front-loaded; the final smile feels earned yet the cost is more implied than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirrored hush becomes a living echo that reweights the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each reversed note thickens the silence until the forward play refracts it—though the causal chain is lyric rather than strictly because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The cavern’s “throat of stone” and petrified drum-skin turntable are tactile constraints; the filament of hush glows in the final image, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clean; the damp air’s swallowing of vibration is consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and tightened when Marin rewinds the wax forward, forcing a confrontation with silence. The cost is the risk of feeling again, legible in the warming pulse inside her chest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from the reversal mechanic: sometimes the path back to feeling runs through inversion. The mirrored hush offers a non-literal answer—silence not as absence but as reflective medium—without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet disciplined; perceptual signature is filtered through a deaf teacher’s tactile metaphors—“filament of hush,” “jagged filament of hush”—and rhythmic control mirrors the drum motif. No head-hopping; compression is taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. Minor loop risk in “filament of hush” repetition is offset by reweighting at closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of deafness, reversed sound, and emotional thaw is fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in form—lyric accumulation rather than causal plot—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
