<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Vivid interiority ("claws brushing spines," "rusted syllables") shows embodied contradiction between feral instinct and archive caretaker; the final moment of opening a new wing is earned by every prior hesitation and carries a felt cost of accepting uncertainty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, every paragraph thickens texture until the pendant arrival tightens choice; closure lands cleanly in the final paragraph where waiting crystallizes into an irreversible commitment—no off-page trickery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Frozen garden as "living archive," mist-walls, frost-bit volumes all physically constrain movement and meaning; the pendant's amber glow against the guardian’s chest finally reconfigures space from perimeter into new wing, satisfying 9+ constraint gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Single dominant stake—risk of breach versus yearning for companionship—stays taut; pendant removal heightens cost, but escalation relies more on lyrical accretion than explicit choices, capping just below high-band strictness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Making friends with uncertainty is dramatized, not spoken: frost-bound solitude, pendant promise, and final wing-opening invite nuanced reflection that persists after the veil lifts, with no moralizing spoon-feed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice carries a textured frost-crust of arcane specificity—“feral library guardian,” “interiorizing exteriors,” “mist-wovenv verses”—whose rhythm heightens without ever falling into purple; perceptual signature remains distinct to end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Almost loop-free; occasional abstract swells (“lattice of interiorized exteriors”) slow propulsion by a tick, yet diction stays controlled and no sentence is idle—density is high and earned.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The living archive garden, a feral librarian beast, and luminous amber pendant fuse into a singular dream-object that feels inevitable not random, with no prior carbon copy—original synthesis justifies risk.</comment>
