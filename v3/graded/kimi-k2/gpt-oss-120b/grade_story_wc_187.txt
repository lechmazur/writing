<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“preemptively nostalgic heart sang”), but the archivist’s choices remain observational—no irreversible micro-choice with visible cost. Motivation is clear yet static; identity-sculpting never collides with a live trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of crystal-whisper → shadow-measure → sunrise silence tightens the stake. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “identity…a collage of shared memory” reweights premise with felt cost of perpetual responsibility. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Stormlit observatory, solid fog, and crystal forecourt are vivid and selective; the crystal’s resonance constrains the final stance. Spatial choreography is coherent; weather actively shapes light and memory geometry. Micro-setting (crystal) charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mapping collective memory—signaled early. One meaningful deepening: shadow length aligns with crystal’s strongest whisper, tightening the ritual’s stakes. Cost is conceptual (endless archival duty) rather than visceral, but legible in the final hush.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme of memory-as-identity emerges through concrete ritual, not statement. Final sunrise image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in “preemptive nostalgia” and “steady resolve” layers grief and vocation; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Distinct lyric texture: “feathered pen tip humming,” “bruised violet sky.” POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hop. Compression and patterned elision (“deepening hush”) are taught early and paid off in closure cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image and concept. Occasional ornate phrasing (“chorus of distant recollections”) risks overwriting but stays within taught pattern. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; rhythm modulates with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: meteorological memory-architecture as identity ritual. Crystal-whisper/shadow-geometry conceit feels inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry; no derivative echoes.</comment>
