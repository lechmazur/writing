<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aric’s grim optimism is embodied in tactile micro-choices—rolling the dice, adjusting the bronze frame—yet the interior contradiction between hope and darkness is asserted more than dramatized. The shift from “capture the missed chance” to “honor its persistence” is credible but compressed; the cost is felt in the final image of the chipped die facing up, though the emotional price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the staircase’s quiet anthem reweights the premise—perpetual motion achieved not by escape but by integration of flaw. Causality holds: each roll feeds the tilt algorithm, the chipped die’s eventual face-up lands as earned scar. One transition (base → eighth → twentieth landing) is cleanly handled.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The staircase is both macro-setting and micro-constraint: its shifting risers literally alter Aric’s tactics. Sensory detail is selective—marble arches, bronze frame, glass disc—filtered through Aric’s obsessive focus. The final image of the singing stone staircase charges the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove perpetual motion from pure logic. Escalation is textural: each roll tightens the lattice of probability, the staircase’s quiver marks the intensification. Cost is visible—the chipped die’s refusal becomes the stabilizing flaw—yet the price feels more conceptual than visceral, keeping it just under the 9-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the paradox of boundless confinement: the staircase as both cage and key. The chipped die’s scar becomes the emblem of imperfection as engine. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: “a faint scar turned triumph.” Subtext operates in the silence between rolls.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-mathematical, consistent in diction and rhythm; “balancedly daring mathematics” and “grain of every lost breath” are character-specific. Compression and patterned elision (“each glyph a whisper”) are taught early and paid off in the final cadence. No dialogue, so no voice leakage.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is disciplined—no mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“kinetic potential,” “conceptual repricing”) fits the mathematician-poet narrator. One scaffold loop: “each step…each motion” could tighten, but it does not dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of perpetual-motion physics with emotional scar tissue feels fresh; the staircase as experimental laboratory reframes a classic paradox. The chipped die’s transformation from obstacle to keystone is an earned, non-obvious turn. Risk-taking (lyric-accumulative structure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
