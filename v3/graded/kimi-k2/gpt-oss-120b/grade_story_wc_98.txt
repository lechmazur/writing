<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid—her “empirically whimsical” mind shows in how she catalogs dreams like weather charts—but the final beat (“luminous doubt…balance she vowed to keep”) is slightly abstract, muting the embodied cost of her choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each symbolic translation thickens atmosphere until the seed’s sprout reweights the ridge’s memory. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the monsoon will test the living archive—but the causality between dream-translation and sprout could be one notch sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ridge’s “jade vines,” “orchids pulsed with sunrise colors,” and phosphorescent lanterns are selective, sensuous, and tied to Mara’s task; the sprouting seed literally charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awaken the seed before monsoon—tightens via each symbolic mapping; the sprout forecloses failure but the price (fragile shoots vs. storm) is more forecast than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of communal memory vs. empirical rigor emerges organically; the final blossom as “repository of a forgotten chant” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control (“lanterns that hummed…questions in a bright hall of doubt”) and a consistent perceptual signature; no head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional stacked metaphors (“wind of thought,” “silvered pages”) flirt with overwriting yet stay legible. No loops or scaffold; momentum sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fantasy trope of dream-interpretation is refreshed by treating memory as empirical data; synthesis feels inevitable and the risk of failure sharpens stakes.</comment>
