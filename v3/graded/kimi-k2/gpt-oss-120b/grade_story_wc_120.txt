<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lian’s interiority is vivid and embodied—her longing is felt in the nautilus shell’s glow and the sand-between-toes memory. The contradiction between homesickness and the drive to conduct unseen symphonies is dramatized in her micro-choices (aligning shell with horizon, sketching on frost). The final renunciation of homesickness as burden, accepting it as compass, is earned and carries visible cost in the glowing lake. Minor slip: “chronologically homesick” leans label-speak, though context rescues it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of image and cadence shift reweight the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lian’s stance crystallizes as she becomes conductor, cost legible in the fracturing mirrored horizon and the released fortune. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3. One causal hiccup: the leap from shell alignment to lake-wide resonance feels slightly elliptical, but pattern teaches lyric causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glass spire, frozen lake, and nautilus shell function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the spire’s resonance, the lake’s membrane of chords, the shell’s spiral trajectory. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“thin mist curled,” “faintly glowing”). The mirrored horizon is not just backdrop but active instrument that amplifies tones and fractures at climax. No orientation debt; spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform homesickness into generative art—is signaled early and tightened through each beat: shell alignment, frost sketching, final release. Escalation is textural: density of sound/light increases until the lake sings. Cost is visible in the fracturing horizon and the fortune released to wind. Agency remains Lian’s throughout; no coincidence resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as score, longing as baton. Subtext operates in gesture—the shell’s glow, the shards of light—rather than statement. Final image reframes homesickness from wound to instrument without moralizing. One near-theme-statement (“Your heart is the baton”) is embedded in a fortune cookie, so distanced it avoids preachiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the musical subject. Perceptual signature is distinct: Lian notices “phosphorescent memory,” “upended hush.” No head-hopping; POV stays tight. Compression and elision (“the wind seemed to pause”) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. Occasional elevated diction (“chronologically homesick,” “conceptual repricing”) is voice-motivated. One mixed metaphor risk—“membrane of vibrating chords”—but context clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise fuses fortune-cookie writer with symphonic conductor in a glass spire; synthesis feels inevitable. Mirrored horizon as literal instrument is fresh. Risk-taking (lyric causality, sound-as-light) heightens stakes without obscuring closure. No close echoes; transformation test passes.</comment>
