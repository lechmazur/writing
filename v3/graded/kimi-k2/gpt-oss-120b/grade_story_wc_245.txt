<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is embodied and specific—her skin “absorbs languages like a sponge,” her ring “glows faintly against her palm.” The final renunciation (leaving the stillpoint to map inner realms) is earned by the prior sensory journey and carries visible cost: she forfeits the external map for an internal one. No contradictory impulses are dramatized in-scene, so the 9+ quick test is narrowly missed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each sensory layer (notes, ring glow, bark pulse) deepens pattern until the cadence shift at the stillpoint. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—time folds, languages dissolve into “one harmonious chord,” and Lira steps back changed. Cost is legible: she abandons the quest for external charts. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>The ultrasonic forest is not backdrop; its shifting hums and magnetic whispers actively guide Lira’s choices and constrain her path. The platinum ring and living bark function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—sound through skin, light through touch—anchoring POV bias. Meets 9+ gate: environment constrains the final step into the stillpoint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—navigate uncharted emotional depths—is signaled early and tightened by each musical note that narrows the path. The final pause of constellations forces the decisive step; cost is the surrender of external mapping. Escalation is textural: density of sensation replaces causal reversals, coherent under Accumulative lens. One meaningful intensification suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: language absorption, ultrasonic forest, stillpoint as emotional nexus. Final image—“a quiet blaze of inner light”—reweights all prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shift from external to internal cartography. Resonance lingers in the harmonic chord of absorbed tongues.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyric yet precise; perceptual signature centers on tactile acoustics—“vibrations on her skin,” “pulse through her fingertips.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadence for wonder, clipped fragments at the stillpoint. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Patterned elision (constellation pause) is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory data without redundancy. Metaphors are coherent—“ink on parchment,” “river of sound”—and serve the textural design. No loops or scaffold; information is compressed. Minor elevated diction (“locus,” “nexus”) fits the mythic register without register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade>
<comment>Premise synthesizes familiar tropes—blind seer, magical forest, inner journey—into a fresh acoustic cartography. The ultrasonic forest and language-absorbing skin are specific inventions that constrain choice. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable: the mapmaker maps herself. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation over causal plot) heightens stakes without obscuring closure.</comment>
