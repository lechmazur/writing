<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (“volcanic tenderness”), but the mentor promise remains abstract; no contradictory impulse is dramatized in-scene, and the final turn to guardian feels more declared than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural glows amber, sealing the archive with felt cost. Causal chain from portrait clue → tapestry → bronze box holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; minor ellipsis in canyon-to-library transition accepted.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Desert canyon, sandstone walls, and basalt dome are tactile and specific; the archive’s glyphs and murals constrain the final act of painting. Sensory selection mirrors the arsonist’s fire-mind, anchoring every beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeem fire into preservation—tightens once when the tapestry completes the phoenix image and the bronze box demands a choice. Cost is visible: he forfeits anonymity and former identity to become guardian.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-fire emerges organically from the arsonist’s trajectory; the phoenix image reweights earlier flames into guardianship without moralizing. Final amber glow offers non-literal resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise; “analytically intuitive” signature threads through color-as-equation metaphors. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off in the final mural cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic; occasional stacked metaphors (“lava-bright murals”) flirt with overwriting but never obscure causality. No loops or scaffold in final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of arsonist-librarian trope; fire-as-memory device feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific glyphs and tapestry mechanics avoid generic fantasy templates.</comment>
