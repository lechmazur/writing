<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid (“eyes reflecting a world more gear than garden”), but the prince’s shift from passive regret to active bridge feels slightly abstract; the cost is stated rather than embodied in a final micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each salvaged gear adds density until the phoenix’s aria reconfigures palace and prince. Closure lands as Charged Poise—palace “swayed gently as if breathing”—with conceptual cost of perpetual guardianship implied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stalactite roots, bronze vines, and crystal shards are tactile constraints that shape the cradle design; the suspended palace itself becomes a living metronome, charging the final image with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawakening beauty—tightens through each salvaged component; the phoenix’s eruption is the single decisive intensification that forecloses the purely mechanical path, though the price is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of redemption-through-flawed-genesis emerges organically from cradle assembly and phoenix song; final image of “gears and feathers” offers non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lush, rhythmic prose mirrors the prince’s gear-garden tension; consistent third-person limited filters every detail through his weary wonder. No head-hop or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm breathes with scene pressure; occasional stacked metaphors (“titanic, glassy fingers”) risk overwriting but never stall momentum. Clean grammar, no loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Familiar phoenix/steampunk tropes are re-forged through the cradle’s mechanical botany and the palace’s suspended stalactite anchor, creating a singular, inevitable synthesis.</comment>
