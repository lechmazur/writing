<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cartographer’s interior contradiction—embracing ignorance as a creative tool—remains abstract; no embodied moment shows him doubting his lattice. His final humility is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the kingdom’s future is “already inscribed” by modeling, a felt reweighting of possibility. Causal linkage holds under a Causal lens, but the cost to the cartographer himself is off-stage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Obsidian spire and frozen lake are vivid and return in the final image, but they frame rather than constrain the decisive modeling act. The copper plates and barley rows supply micro-setting pressure, lifting the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stake—prevent famine—is clear and escalates via the three-month delay forecast. One tightening beat: the scholars’ skepticism is overturned by on-page success, but the personal price to the cartographer remains muted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme of turning ignorance into generative canvas emerges organically from the cartographer’s method and the kingdom’s survival. Final image of golden barley reflecting obsidian offers resonant non-moral answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“shimmered like the feather’s iridescence”). Perceptual signature is consistent; no POV drift. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but propulsive; occasional stacked modifiers (“dark needle from the frozen lake”) risk overwriting yet stay purposeful. No loops or scaffold; information density high. Final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of mythic cartography with predictive modeling feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in concept is fully committed; no retreat to generic fantasy. Transformation test passes—setting and premise are inseparable.</comment>
