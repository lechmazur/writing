<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and embodied (“warmly curious heart swelling”), but her contradictory impulses remain muted; the final smile feels earned yet the cost is more atmospheric than personal. No genuine flaw complicates her path, so the arc leans restorative rather than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each unearthed layer deepens the orchard’s resonance until the sundial’s click reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—the orchard’s hush after the chime—felt cost is the irreversible shift from silence to answered prayer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is rendered with tactile specificity (“roots snake between bones like pale rivers”); the bioluminescent roots and moon-silver sundial shadow constrain placement and timing, charging the final altar image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore faith via completed altar—tightens as each relic narrows the path to success. One decisive intensification: the final stone’s click forecloses further wandering and releases ancestral voice. Cost is communal rather than personal, slightly softening the bite.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of mending fractured lineage emerges through concrete acts; no moralizing. The orchard’s shift from ossuary to living sanctuary reweights earlier images without explicit statement. Final sunrise tapestry is resonant, non-literal answer to diaspora longing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter; diction is lyrical yet disciplined (“marrow of the dead whisper faint hymns”). No head-hop; psychic distance modulates with pressure. Voice is consistent and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional poetic layering (“bone-laced corridors”) risks overwriting yet remains legible. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. One mixed metaphor (“roots…like pale rivers of memory”) is minor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis of necropolis and orchard as living reliquary; diaspora returnee trope gains specificity through ancestral clock. Risk is moderate—quiet lyric closure rather than spectacle—but transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
