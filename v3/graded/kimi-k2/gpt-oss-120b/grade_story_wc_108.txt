<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—stunt bravado vs. terror—is embodied in trembling hands and rehearsed calm; the final choice to confess fear and drink the amber is earned by prior beats and carries visible cost (loss of the old mask). Reflection stays within BRR limits and tilts present tactics. Minor slip: “trembling certainty” edges toward label-speak once.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the amber breath crystallizes a new stance (“hovered on the edge of the universe”) with felt cost—the public identity forfeited. Causal chain holds: fear decoded → lever disarmed → vial claimed → confession traded. No orientation debt; library anchors by line 3. Lens is Causal throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Rusted library, cracked dome, and constellations are vivid yet selective; the seashell and lever function as micro-settings that constrain choices. Sensory detail narrows under pressure (dust cascade, amber pulse). One spatial glitch: “stepped onto the ancient lever” reads as if the lever is on the floor, not behind a shelf—minor but momentarily disorients.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—transform betrayal of self into power—is signaled early and tightened once: the lever test forces a public confession. Escalation is causal and legible; cost is the forfeited stunt-double persona. No extraneous reversals; pressure stays coherent under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: vulnerability as power. The seashell’s whisper and the reversed-name constellation reweight identity without moralizing. Final image (“hovered on the edge of the universe”) offers non-literal resonance. One near-theme-statement (“identity is a mask we all wear”) is brief and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
<comment>Voice is distinct—stunt-trained perception filters every object through risk and motion (“backflips for circles”). Rhythm modulates with stress; compression is taught early and paid off. No POV drift. Dialogue absent; no penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is patterned and purposeful (“rusted bones,” “amber fire ripple”). No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“heart, once a trembling drum, now beat with firmly adaptive rhythm”—slightly muddles instrument and agency, but does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Fresh synthesis: stunt-double phobia decoded via choreographed cipher; betrayal weaponized into courage. Specificity of stunt grammar (backflips, rolls, breath holds) grounds the fantastical library. Risky inversion of hero myth lands cleanly. No derivative echoes.</comment>
