<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical but abstract; the child’s “featherly determined” trait is named more than embodied. Micro-choices (hand on copper, foot on seam) are present yet feel guided by authorial design rather than urgent contradiction. The final renunciation—turning back to share the secret—lands as quiet Earned Stasis, but the cost is only lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the child chooses guardianship over escape, reweighting the maze from trap to trust. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each sensory beat thickens pattern rather than tightens options. Orientation is taught early via the hovering terrace and copper plate, satisfying the disorientation waiver.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace, copper sundial, and shifting-ink maps are vivid and selective; the glass corridor literally channels the child’s descent. Micro-setting (wood grain rings) constrains route-finding, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guardianship of thresholds—emerges late but is signaled by the mother’s earlier lesson. Pressure deepens through sensory density rather than causal reversals; the corridor reveal tightens options once. Cost is conceptual (loss of innocence) rather than visceral, yet legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of sacred thresholds emerges organically from repeated images of doors, seams, and pauses. Final image reframes the maze as living ritual without moralizing. Subtext in the silent gaps and wind-echoed voice carries more weight than any statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyric, with controlled compression and patterned elision taught early (“featherly determined”). Perceptual signature is child-specific: attention to grain, vibration, light fracture. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates with wonder and loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is musical and dense; occasional stacked metaphors (“fractured hush,” “silent chords”) risk overwriting but stay within pattern. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance image or motion. Rhythm breathes with the child’s slowed perception.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise fuses corn-maze folklore with hovering glass architecture in a fresh synthesis. The butterfly-effect timeframe and weather-code object feel inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyric mode pays off by charging the final guardianship stance.</comment>
