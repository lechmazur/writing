<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is lyrical and specific, but the conflicted novelist’s doubt is summarized rather than embodied in a decisive micro-choice; the final “solemn promise” feels asserted, not dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—spiral fragment glows, hopes settle—yet the cost is more atmospheric than concrete; causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but the bridge-image is gestural.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mist and nexus function as micro-setting that constrains movement and attention; the spiral fragment’s physical curve guides the pen, charging the final image with tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collecting hopes against narrative current—is signaled early; pressure deepens via denser mist and louder “closing pages,” but the tightening remains atmospheric rather than option-narrowing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>Theme of binding fleeting hopes emerges from concrete ritual and spiral motif; final image reframes prior cameos without moralizing, though ambiguity tilts toward affirmation rather than cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Voice is textured, rhythmic, and perceptually biased; “lucidly watchful” diction sustains lyric compression without head-hopping, though occasional elevated phrasing edges toward purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is dense and musical; a few stacked metaphors (“swirling hush,” “feral nexus”) risk overwriting, but rhythm modulates with pressure and no loops stall the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Fusion of mythic quest and metafictional notebook ritual feels fresh; spiral-as-compass and upstream-swimming conceit transform familiar writer-in-the-woods trope into specific, inevitable arc.</comment>
