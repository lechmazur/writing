<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is poetically layered but drifts toward abstract self-report; her motives (heal via words, decode temple) are announced rather than pressed into concrete, costly micro-choices. The decisive act—sharing the burden aloud—carries some embodied tremor, yet the “heal the world with words” epiphany feels gifted rather than earned by struggle. Emotional contradiction appears mainly in summary, not in the crucible of live beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Open dome → telegram → journal glyphs → variable-star map → temple door glow: each beat is causally yoked, tightening toward closure. Closure is a conceptual repricing: burden transformed into shared covenant with sky-mountain communion; the cost is the eternal continuation of vigilance rather than release. Drive lens holds as Accumulative/Textural: density of image, scent, light pulses to final reweighting.</comment>

<comment>Observatory is tactile—“marble chair”, “telescope hum”—yet never becomes a constraining mechanism or tool; it is backdrop rather than actor. Atmosphere is rich, sustained across sight, scent, ozone, and flower fragrance, but no single physical detail alters Mara’s options or charges the final image directly. Sensory palette supports theme yet remains picturesque rather than utilitarian.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Central stake is the decoding of shared burdens; tension mounts as glyphs align with star pulses. Pressure intensifies when each star-pulse is read as an actual navigational cue toward temple entry, narrowing escape routes to “share or fail”. Cost is the implicit open-ended stewardship: eternal decoding vigil, crystallized—tangible, visible on the final page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of collective responsibility emerges from image accretion, not explicit speech. Telegram perfume and star-shifts braid into the notion that private grief only subsides when externalized into communal archive. The daylily telegram’s eventual reprise beside the crystal reweights its first arrival as seed rather than message—a quiet conceptual repricing without moral summary.</comment>

<comment>Mara’s voice is singular—perceptive yet softly fatalistic, always attuned to scent and starlight. Syntax pulses like a night tide, deliberate elongation then concise telescopic clicks. No POV slippage, and the lyric diction mirrors a chronicler who literally tastes and smells language. The diction modulates cleanly from hushed invocation into crystallized awe.</comment>

<comment>Prose is lyrical yet taut: every clause layers sensory immediacy without excess ornament. A few metaphor stacks (“trembling desk”, “midnight solace wrapping her like warm blanket of clouds”) touch purple but never obscure clarity. Information density remains high; no scaffolds or synonym loops. The closing lullaby phrase lands cleanly, echoing earlier perfume/ozone coupling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Fresh in merging dream-archiving with celestial cryptography; daylily telegram fuses Victorian ephemera with astral cartography, a collision rarely seen. The “heal with words” concept hovers close to self-care cliché, yet is rescued by literalization via star-glyph lexicon. Not radically unprecedented, but executed with cohesion and tactile wonder.</comment>
