I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through pattern accumulation, sensory density, and a final resonant reconfiguration rather than causal plot progression.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to honor overlooked histories through translation work is consistent and embodied through concrete actions with the lighthouse fragment. However, the transformation from translator to beacon lacks sufficient embodied struggle or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—the resolution arrives too smoothly without dramatized internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator becomes the lighthouse beacon, but the cost remains abstract ("voices that never found a shore") rather than viscerally felt on the page. The accumulative texture builds adequately but the final transformation from fragment dissolution to shared memory lacks a concrete, visible price that would elevate the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The alchemist's market setting effectively constrains choices through the painted stalls as encoded doorways and the specific navigation of "narrow ledges" above rooftops. The lighthouse fragment's "cold yet humming" glass and the paintings' details (gull with shard, lantern-eyes) create vivid sensory anchors that shape the translation process.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through pattern recognition (paintings converging with fragment's glow) and the unfolding revelation of the silver chain. However, the resolution lacks genuine obstacle or resistance—the translation succeeds without meaningful complication or forced trade-off that would heighten the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of preserving overlooked histories emerges organically through the lighthouse memory translation, with the narrator becoming the beacon they sought to honor. The recursive structure (child with coin, mother's whisper, father's tale) creates resonance, though the final moral about carrying stories feels slightly overstated rather than purely embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The lyrical voice maintains consistency with phrases like "between-worlds translator" and "anchors of intuition," creating a dreamlike register appropriate to the concept. However, some passages drift into purple prose ("stars in a quiet sky") and the POV occasionally explains rather than embodies ("I realize that my translation has become that beacon").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose rhythm varies effectively and supports the accumulative structure, but several instances of overwriting dilute impact: "elusively tangible balance," "forever the bridge," and repetitive "I realize" constructions. The density of figurative language in non-peak moments ("constellation of stories," "tide of memory") creates ornamental rather than functional imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The concept of a between-worlds translator working in an elevated alchemist's market offers a fresh angle, and the paintings-as-encoded-maps device shows originality. However, the resolution into beacon metaphor and carrying stories forward follows predictable literary patterns without sufficient transformation to elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>
