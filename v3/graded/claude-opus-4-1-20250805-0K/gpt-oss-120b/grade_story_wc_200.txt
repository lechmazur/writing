I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This reads as Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered sensory details, repeated motifs (crocodile's tooth, harp's discord, laughter/grief), and cadence shifts that culminate in transformation. The closure operates through pattern accumulation rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization shows consistent motivation through her "modestly fearless" pursuit of spectral healing, with the crocodile's tooth serving as a concrete anchor for her purpose. The transformation from collecting confessions to integrating laughter shows earned change, though internal contradiction could be more embodied during the crucial joke-telling moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's laughter transforms spectral sorrow into redemption, with visible cost in the "luminous ache" that softens in her chest. The accumulative lens holds consistently through layered sensory details building to the transformation, though the joke itself feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Echo Gorge functions as more than setting - its stone walls, water, and acoustic properties actively shape how Mara pursues the spirits. The crocodile's tooth resonating against the gorge wall creates a concrete constraint that enables communication, making the environment essential to the story's mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from hearing whispers to achieving clearer speech to discovering laughter as the missing element. The pressure deepens when Mara must offer genuine laughter "with true intent," though the goat joke resolution lacks the weight of earlier buildup.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of grief into hope via laughter, avoiding explicit moralizing. The "luminous ache" motif effectively bridges sorrow and healing, and the final image of the humming gorge offers resonant closure without stating its meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "translucent sighs" and "sunrise glass," creating a distinct texture appropriate to the spectral subject. POV remains stable with Mara's perceptual signature filtering the supernatural through concrete sensory details.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("each confession a fragile thread of pain that shimmered like sunrise glass") but suffers from occasional overwriting. Some metaphors strain ("torn fabric of each lingering soul") and the repetition of "modestly fearless" feels mechanical rather than purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise of a soul collector using laughter to heal spectral grief shows originality, particularly the crocodile's tooth as a resonance device. However, the goat joke feels generic and the transformation mechanism (single laugh healing all spirits) lacks the specificity that earlier details promised.</comment>
