<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's claustrophobia creates internal tension but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—her fear dissipates too quickly once inside. The final choice to bury the codex carries visible cost but feels under-motivated given the shallow characterization throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The closure (burying the codex) constitutes a Decisive Change with implied cost, but causality weakens through unmotivated phase transitions and convenient technology. The accumulative lens builds atmosphere effectively but the "return protocol" and dimensional slip lack earned linkage to prior beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail ("thick with the scent of salt and old circuitry") and the facility's physical presence effectively constrain movement. However, the phase transition space and "cavernous chamber" lack spatial coherence, and the setting doesn't meaningfully shape the final choice to bury the codex.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving forgotten knowledge) is signaled early but escalation relies on convenient technology rather than protagonist agency. The phase transition provides spectacle without meaningful cost or trade-off, and the resolution (burying the codex) contradicts the stated goal without earned reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of remembering the forgotten emerges through concrete imagery, particularly the scientists' names "etched in sea-foam." However, the final burial action muddles rather than crystallizes the thematic question, and "standing by the unremembered" reads as prompt-echo rather than earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent POV and atmospheric texture ("crashing hush," "jellyfish bellies lit from within"). However, register drift into technical jargon ("phase transition arrays") clashes with the lyrical voice, and key information is withheld without payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Strong moments of figurative language ("hulking mouth that swallowed any hint of daylight") but density becomes excessive with mixed metaphors. Template cadence appears in "She raised...She stepped...She buried" sequence, and the phrase "crashing hush" creates logical contradiction without taught pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The underwater research facility setting and phosphorescent codex offer fresh imagery, and the synthesis of spelunking expertise with undersea exploration shows originality. However, the phase transition technology reads as convenient problem-solving, and the resolution defaults to familiar "hidden knowledge" tropes.</comment>
