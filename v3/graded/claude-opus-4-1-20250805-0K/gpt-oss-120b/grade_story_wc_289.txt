<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to find the thread that connects all things" is clear but remains abstract throughout. The character shows minimal internal conflict or embodied emotion during her journey through the installation. Her final contentment lacks earned causality—the transformation from seeking to finding happens without visible struggle or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story presents a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira "rejoins" the chorus of hidden stories, but the cost remains entirely abstract. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but lacks density increase or pattern break that would reweight stakes. Critical flaw: no visible or felt cost appears on the page—Mira simply walks through an installation and feels satisfied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lotus temple and lily pond create atmospheric beauty with "sequined ribbons" of rain and "prismatic quiet." The thrush's nest twig spiral functions as interactive setting that responds to Mira's whispers. However, the environment never constrains choices—Mira moves through it without obstacle or resource limitation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation occurs under any lens. Mira approaches spiral, whispers into it, steps on it, catches a petal, whispers again—each action flows without resistance or complication. The "thread tightening" and "cascade of silver light" are ornamental responses, not pressure that narrows options or forces trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of connection through secret stories emerges through the installation's function as "conduit" for love letters across time. The recurring "thread" motif and "prismatic quiet" create coherence. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("each secret weaving into the next"), violating the show-don't-tell principle at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled imagery ("pale sunrise hovering on calm water"). POV remains stable in third-person limited. However, the voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—Mira's ghostwriter profession doesn't shape how she notices or describes, creating generic literary prettiness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades with figurative language in most sentences ("notebook humming," "hush of centuries," "silken line pulling"). Template cadence appears in parallel constructions: "She whispered...She stepped...She felt...She realized." Paraphrase loops occur: "keeper of secrets" restated as "role she could fulfill by guiding these letters."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The concept of love letters finding homes in a magical installation offers mild freshness but executes through familiar mystical-realism tropes. The transformation lacks specificity—swap "love letters" for "memories" or "wishes" and the story functions identically. No risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis elevates beyond competent genre exercise.</comment>
