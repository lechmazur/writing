I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through resonant imagery and density shifts rather than strict causality, culminating in a conceptual repricing where "unused potential" transforms from external hunt to internal state.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's grief-to-awakening arc is coherent and embodied through concrete actions (calibrating visor, stepping toward fissure, catching shard). However, the transformation from loss to "fierce, exhilarating clarity" feels slightly rushed without sufficient intermediate struggle, and some interiority relies on abstract concepts ("unfiltered awakening") rather than visceral embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where "unused potential" shifts from external pool to internal state of being, with felt cost in the protagonist's transformation through grief. The accumulative structure coheres through crystal/resonance imagery building to the final constellation image, though the midpoint could strengthen the pressure-to-revelation bridge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory setting actively constrains choices (the fissure, the magnetic cradle, the rim) and the geode's physical properties drive action. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("bruised violet sky," "rust and ozone"), though some technical elements ("perturbation theory," "probability lattice") lack sufficient grounding in physical reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming grief into possibility—deepens through the protagonist's active choices (calibrating, stepping forward, thrusting palm), with visible cost in his scarred suit and lost bride. The escalation from observation to merger feels earned, though the middle section could tighten the pressure between discovery and action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "unused potential" from external treasure to internal state, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of "constellation of hopes he could finally grasp" resonantly reweights the opening loss without stating meaning, and the complexity of grief-becoming-possibility resists simple resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevation appropriate to the conceptual material, with controlled rhythm that accelerates during the energy surge. The perceptual signature ("intangibly tangible," synesthetic descriptions) is distinctive, though occasional register drift into technical abstraction ("perturbation theory") slightly disrupts the emotional throughline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful imagery, with lines doing multiple jobs (the opening sky both sets atmosphere and mirrors internal state). Some figurative density in peak moments ("constellation of hopes") works thematically but occasionally tips toward overwriting, and technical terms could integrate more smoothly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of drone-strike trauma with quasi-mystical awakening offers a fresh angle on grief transformation. The specific detail of "wedding survivor" and the unique worldbuilding (floating observatory, resonance-reading) create memorable particularity, though the resolution edges toward the conceptually tidy.</comment>
