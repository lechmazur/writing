<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara's gambling inheritance and motivation to "widen perspectives responsibly" create clear internal tension between certainty and chance. The final choice to write a theorem embracing both shows agency, though the emotional cost of her mother's death remains abstractly handled rather than embodied in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with symbolic discovery replacing causal pressure. The closure (writing a new theorem) achieves Conceptual Repricing but lacks visible cost—"she knew that her work would be theoretically rebellious" tells rather than shows the price. The underground journey accumulates meaning but doesn't fundamentally alter Mara's options or force a true trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The library and hidden subway create atmospheric pressure through "rainwashed" filtering and phosphorescent symbols. The candle lantern's mica pane constrains navigation choices when "its flame kisses the mica, the path clears." However, the underground remains more conceptual maze than physical space with concrete obstacles.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving probability can embrace chance—is declared but never tested through genuine risk or loss. Mara's journey underground faces no meaningful obstacles; each cryptic scrawl yields immediately to her interpretation without cost or failure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "lucid contradictions" theme emerges through the probability/gambling duality and the ledger bridging both worlds. The final theorem attempts thematic synthesis but arrives through assertion ("embraced both certainty and chance") rather than earned dramatic revelation. The mother's death hovers without charging specific choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent literary register but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Mara notices like a narrator, not a gambler's daughter. Phrases like "veins of possibility" and "clover melancholy" feel imposed rather than emerging from her specific consciousness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on abstract descriptors ("lucid contradictions," "theoretically rebellious") and telling phrases ("Mara's motivation was simple yet heavy") slow momentum. The paraphrase loop "to widen perspectives responsibly"/"her motivation to widen perspectives responsibly" and filter-heavy construction ("She felt the weight," "She knew," "She smiled") create distance from immediate experience.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The hidden subway-as-probability-map offers conceptual freshness, and linking the father's gambling ledger to mathematical study shows specific synthesis. However, the execution remains safely abstract—Mara faces no genuine gambling moment where she must risk something concrete.</comment>
