<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to "shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" drives the ritual but lacks embodied internal conflict—her "centuries" of waiting is told, not felt through specific cost. The storm herald functions more as catalyst than character, his "Shadowed elation" asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the lighthouse beam redirecting inward to birth a "new dawn," with cost implied in "strange, joyous melancholy." However, the accumulative lens wavers—the ritual's mechanics (prism, phosphorescent algae, newspaper) accumulate without clear causal linkage, and the transformation from steering storms to painting dawn lacks concrete stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and phosphorescent sea create vivid atmosphere, with the lighthouse beam becoming a "living serpent of light" that constrains the ritual's execution. Setting actively shapes choice through the prism's total internal reflection and the reef "where darkness lived," though some details (basalt steps, sapphire currents) serve more as texture than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing the ritual before "the tide erases our chance"—provides urgency but the escalation relies on accumulating imagery rather than narrowing options. The newspaper's dissolution triggers the ritual but coincidence ("Accidentally prophetic" signs) drives discovery more than protagonist agency, and the cost remains abstract ("shadowed brilliance") rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of using "ancient shadows to paint the morning with hope," with the lighthouse beam's inward turn literalizing inner transformation. The "Shadowed elation" concept resonates in the ending's "strange, joyous melancholy," though the wisdom feels asserted ("the world would not end, but would be reborn") rather than earned through specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The lyric voice creates atmosphere through phrases like "sea sighed beneath" and "thunder and mirth," but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Mira's centuries of experience don't alter her diction or observation patterns. Dialogue serves its minimal function ("We must act now") without subtext, and the narrative stance drifts between mythic distance and close focus without clear purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of beauty ("living serpent of light") but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff, creating opacity. Template patterns emerge ("Mira felt...She whispered...She stepped forward") and abstract assertions ("strange, joyous melancholy") replace embodied specificity in crucial beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The concept of redirecting a lighthouse beam inward through total internal reflection offers genuine freshness, transforming the maritime beacon trope. The synthesis of ancient ritual with optical physics creates non-obvious resonance, though execution relies on accumulated symbols rather than dramatized transformation.</comment>
