<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's trauma-informed perception creates a distinct lens, but her internal experience relies heavily on abstract concepts ("mathematics of mercy," "geometry of compassion") rather than embodied contradiction. The final renunciation of the strap as burden shows earned change, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story operates as Accumulative/Textural, building through sensory patterns toward a Conceptual Repricing where the strap transforms from shackle to promise. However, the cost remains oblique—we see symbolic transformation but not what Lira sacrifices or risks in this forest journey. The "ultraviolet penance" mechanism never clarifies its rules or stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest creates a distinctive sensory environment that constrains Lira's movement and perception, with the pewter strap serving as a micro-setting element that bridges past and present. The crystalline roots humming mathematical notes effectively merge setting with thematic discovery, though some descriptions ("impossible shades of violet") lean abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>While the forest demands "a price" through violet light that "seared her skin," this remains the only concrete pressure point, and Lira endures it without visible struggle or tactical adjustment. The dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—never faces genuine opposition or requires sacrifice beyond accepting painful light.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of calculating mercy through remembered suffering emerges through the forest's synesthetic mathematics, avoiding direct moralizing. However, the equation "mercy equals the sum of understood suffering divided by the willingness to remember" still reads as thesis statement rather than earned insight from dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful compression, though abstract diction ("proprioceptively enhanced," "lattice of bruised memories") occasionally obscures rather than illuminates. No dialogue appears, and the perceptual signature, while trauma-informed, lacks the specific selectivity that would distinguish Lira's unique way of noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Repetitive constructions plague key passages ("She braced herself...She braced again...She braced for the final surge"). Abstract language dominates concrete imagery, with concepts like "mathematics of mercy" and "geometry of compassion" creating semantic loops rather than advancing pressure. The filter-heavy construction ("feeling," "wondered," "realized") dulls immediacy throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of trauma-informed perception with a mathematical forest creates an unusual angle, and the strap's transformation from oppression symbol to beacon shows thematic coherence. However, the execution relies on familiar healing-journey templates without sufficient lived detail to fully transform the archetype.</comment>
