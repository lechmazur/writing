I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and metaphorical density rather than causal linkage, with the lighthouse beam's sweep serving as the organizing rhythm.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The fortune cookie writer's motivation emerges through accumulated detail rather than embodied struggle. His transformation from cryptic riddler to orchestrator of fate lacks the internal contradiction and cost that would make his choice resonate. The piece tells us about his "sudden surge of purpose" without showing the embodied tension of that shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing through the lighthouse becoming "a beacon of open mysteries," but the cost remains abstract. The story accumulates metaphorical layers without establishing clear stakes or a before/after shift. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive adequately, but the conceptual weight never crystallizes into felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting effectively constrains the narrative space and its beam provides a recurring visual motif. Sensory details like "steaming tray of cookies" and "scented oil" ground moments, though the piece relies heavily on abstract conceptual description over tactile immediacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure should build through density and pattern, but here the stakes remain conceptual abstractions about "encoded memories" and "hidden truths." The story declares transformation without showing the friction or cost of that change. No meaningful tightening occurs that would foreclose options or force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of hidden knowledge becoming open secrets emerges through repetition but lacks specificity. The fortune cookies as "covert carriers of truth" presents an intriguing paradox, yet the thematic exploration remains surface-level, relying on abstract assertions about fate and destiny rather than earned insight through particular experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction, reading as literary template prose. Filter-heavy constructions like "He realized" and "He felt" distance us from immediacy. The POV remains stable but the perceptual signature is generic - any literary protagonist could notice these same abstract concepts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors ("mirror that reflected," "transpose life into a new key") and abstract conceptual language that obscures rather than clarifies. Template cadence appears in repetitive "He [verb]" constructions. The prose prioritizes elevated diction over clarity, with phrases like "conspiratorial accomplice" and "forged key of humanity" that strain for profundity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise of a fortune cookie writer embedding spy microdots offers originality, and the lighthouse-as-transmitter concept shows invention. However, execution relies on familiar literary abstractions about fate and secrets rather than mining the specific possibilities of this unique setup.</comment>
