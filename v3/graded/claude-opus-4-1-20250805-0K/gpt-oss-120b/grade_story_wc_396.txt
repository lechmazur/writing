<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The peacekeeper's motivation to reconstitute wholeness feels abstractly noble rather than personally urgent. While her "calmly intuitive" nature is stated, internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—she proceeds with methodical certainty through mystical tasks without genuine struggle or cost visible in her choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the crystal's reconstitution as closure, but the transformation lacks visible cost—the orchard blooms and the world breathes in unison without sacrifice or trade-off. The orientation anchors (lighthouse orchard, ice floes) arrive promptly, yet the magical resolution feels unearned by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice creates an evocative setting that frames the mystical work. However, the environment doesn't constrain choices—the peacekeeper moves freely through frost to the van of mirrors without the cold or ice creating obstacles that alter her tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract ("unspoken hopes pressing against the ice") without concrete pressure forcing difficult choices. The crystal reconstruction proceeds without opposition or meaningful complication—the mirrors simply work as intended, showing visions that guide rather than challenge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of mapping empathy onto action emerges through the crystal's restoration bringing warmth and renewal. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the thematic message ("the true power lay not in the stone but in the willingness to listen"), violating the show-don't-tell principle at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The voice maintains mystical elevation throughout but lacks distinct personality—phrases like "shadow-laced peacekeeper" and "courageous anomaly" feel like prompt-language rather than organic narration. Perceptual signature is generic; any mystical character could notice these same details in this same register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose suffers from overwriting ("shadow-laced," "frost-kissed," "weather-worn") and abstract mystical language that obscures concrete action. Template structures appear: "She watched...She felt...She understood..." creates repetitive cadence. The final paragraph contains multiple theme statements that should emerge through image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The mystical healer restoring a broken artifact through mirror-visions follows fantasy template without transformation. The "courageous anomaly" concept and mapping empathy onto action feel like assigned elements rather than organic story logic emerging from specific character need.</comment>
