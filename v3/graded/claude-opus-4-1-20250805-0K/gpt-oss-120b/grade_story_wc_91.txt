<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's core motivation—exhausted philanthropist seeking renewal through understanding transformation—is clear and consistent. However, her internal experience relies heavily on abstract contemplation ("deeper curiosity pulsed beneath the joke") rather than embodied contradiction, and the fisherman exists only as a prop for thematic dialogue without applying pressure or forcing meaningful choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the fireflies' release and Mara's understanding that "transformation was not a single event but a texture," but the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases toward closure, yet lacks a decisive tightening that forecloses options—Mara simply continues her charitable work with "uncanny timing."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The volcanic beach setting is vividly rendered with "black sand," "smoldering amber," and sensory details of "salt and ash." The fireflies' glass jar and luminous sand create micro-settings that enable key actions, though the environment doesn't constrain choices as much as provide atmospheric backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>While the story establishes Mara's search for understanding as its dominant stake, escalation occurs through passive accumulation (fireflies escape, fisherman appears, prophecy revealed) rather than protagonist agency. No meaningful options are foreclosed, and the "coincidences" that resolve tension undercut earned pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The transformation theme emerges through concrete images—fireflies as "captive constellations," their release creating "luminous tapestry"—but resolution tilts toward explicit thesis statements: "transformation was not a single event but a texture woven through every breath." The prophecy framework feels imposed rather than organically discovered through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("The night settled over the black sand beach"), though it occasionally drifts into overwrought abstraction ("vibrant hush that sang of possibilities blooming in the shadows of ash"). Mara's perceptual signature focuses on luminosity and cosmic patterns, creating coherent if sometimes purple voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "whispering hush"/"vibrant hush" appears five times with minimal variation; "transformation" concepts repeat without deepening. Overwriting pervades peak moments ("each passing comet of light seemed to fulfill a fragment"), and the prose prioritizes atmospheric description over propulsive clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bottled fireflies as "captive constellations" that mirror celestial movements offers a fresh synthesis of micro and macro scales. However, the prophecy fulfillment and charitable wanderer finding meaning through mystical coincidence follows familiar spiritual journey templates without sufficient transformation through specific lived detail.</comment>
