I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and metaphorical discovery rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to understand night-blooming flowers drives concrete actions through postcards and cathedral exploration. The internal need is embodied through tears and physical movement, though the epiphany about "shared secrets" arrives somewhat unearned. Character-specific perception emerges through her artist's eye for light and pattern.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara understands night flowers as "a promise whispered in the dawning hush," with emotional cost visible in her tears and release of "cold doubts." However, the cathedral's hidden layers mechanism feels convenient rather than earned, and the conceptual resolution relies heavily on abstract assertion ("dialogue between darkness and light") rather than dramatized discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains and enables—the amber pavilion's light, cathedral's etched glass, and melting snow create a lived-in world that shapes Mara's journey. The hidden prism mechanism and phosphorescent garden effectively merge setting with revelation. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from pavilion to cathedral and back.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through layered imagery (postcards → glass → hidden garden), but the revelation arrives through passive observation rather than earned struggle. The emotional cost registers in tears and the release of "cold doubts," though this transformation lacks the resistance that would heighten stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of hidden beauty and patient revelation emerges through concrete images—night flowers, etched glass, postcards as memory bridges. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("even the coldest winter yields to a softer, brighter bloom") rather than trusting the accumulated imagery, reducing resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception filtered through an artist's sensibility ("bruised sky," "umbral tenderness"). Some register elevation feels unmotivated ("phosphorescent rhythm that matched her heartbeat"), but the texture generally supports the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose suffers from overwriting—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching payoff ("amber light filtered through cracked panes, casting elongated shadows that danced with umbral tenderness"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the theme of "dawning hush" and winter/bloom imagery. The density obscures rather than clarifies key moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The postcards-as-memory-bridges concept offers a fresh angle on revelation, and the cathedral's hidden layers create an original discovery mechanism. However, the night-blooming flower mystery resolves into familiar territory about darkness/light dialogue without surprising transformation.</comment>
