I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece - the "raveling silence" accumulates through pattern and imagery toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara's sacrifice becomes "the very warp that would bind two worlds together."

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and her sacrifice concrete, with the internal acceptance "that to send the bead's message she would have to leave something of herself behind" embodying genuine cost. However, the character lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene - she proceeds with minimal internal friction, and her emotional progression feels too smooth for someone making a permanent sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's sacrifice transforms into "the loom of tomorrow," with visible cost in the dimmed amber bead and her acceptance of loss. The accumulative structure coheres through the weaving metaphor and puzzle-path progression. Deducting for slight ambiguity in what exactly Mara sacrifices beyond the abstract "something of herself."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard setting actively shapes the journey through puzzle-piece pathways and the stone pedestal that enables the message transmission. Strong sensory work with "bamboo leaves brushed her cheeks" and "ground slick with dew." The environment constrains choices through its maze-like structure requiring the amber bead as compass.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake - sending a message across "impossible distance" - is clear, with escalation through the puzzle-path discovery and the growing resonance as "each click a quiet chord rang through the raveling silence." However, the progression lacks genuine obstacles or reversals; Mara faces no meaningful resistance, and the sacrifice feels predetermined rather than forced by mounting pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The loom/weaving metaphor elegantly unifies the piece, with silence as "a loom of absence" and sacrifice becoming "the very warp that would bind two worlds together." The theme of connection through sacrifice emerges organically from the journey. The ending reweights the opening's "wistful" characterization into purposeful loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct voice with lyrical compression: "the air clung to a hush that felt like the breath of an ancient loom." The perceptual signature maintains consistency through weaving-inflected observations. Some register elevation feels unmotivated ("stoically sparkling" appears three times), but the rhythmic control supports the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Overwriting issues include the triple repetition of "stoically sparkling" and dense figurative language that occasionally obscures clarity ("hush of time's unraveling tapestry"). Several paraphrase loops: "raveling silence" concepts reiterated without advancement. However, the prose maintains momentum and the closing image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of loom-spinning with message-sending through puzzle pieces offers a fresh angle, though the execution relies on familiar quest patterns. The specific image of sacrifice becoming "the loom of tomorrow" shows originality. The piece commits to its lyrical mode without retreating to exposition.</comment>
