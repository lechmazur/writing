<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The historian's motivation is clear and consistent, with his sensitively perceptive nature driving concrete actions like feeling wall vibrations and matching diary fragments to tapestry patterns. The final choice to secure the fragment and record the moment shows earned agency with visible cost (the world's axis has shifted). However, interiority relies on abstract descriptors ("bronze quiet rhythm," "humming with resonance") rather than embodied contradiction, and no meaningful internal conflict complicates his methodical progress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the historian's discovery that the displaced axis is "not a fracture but a realignment," with the silo breathing as "living pulse" at closure. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer (tapestry, diaries, glyphs, vibrations) toward this reconfiguration. Cost is present but somewhat abstract—"the last sigh of humanity's collective dream"—though the final image of gathered stories makes it felt. The orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The silo setting actively constrains and enables the historian's investigation—the narrow stairwell, vaulted chamber with glyphs, and walls that "sing" all shape his discovery path. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric ("metallic taste of age," vibrations "like a low tide"). The environment functions as more than backdrop, with the reclaimed library's transformation central to meaning. However, some descriptions lean abstract ("bronze quiet glow") rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the mystery of the displaced axis—is signaled early and deepens through accumulating discoveries (diary line about moon's axis, tapestry dragons' curved necks, wall vibrations, hidden conduit). The resolution occurs through the historian's deliberate investigation with visible transformation (the room "shivers"). However, no meaningful opposition complicates his progress, and the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt through struggle or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of preservation and transformation after apocalypse emerges through concrete details—the reclaimed silo, half-burnt diaries, the axis as "realignment" rather than fracture. The final image of the library holding "living pulse" resonantly answers the opening's "forgotten texts." However, the piece occasionally states its themes too directly ("his purpose is simple yet profound") and the conceptual cost of humanity's ended dreams could be more viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent literary register with controlled rhythm and selective perception fitting the historian character. Phrases like "moth" movement and "ash of centuries" create atmospheric texture. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("bronze quiet cadence") that feels more authorial than character-driven, and some repetitive constructions ("bronze quiet" appears three times) suggest template patterning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose achieves atmospheric density with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, abstract modifiers proliferate ("bronze quiet rhythm," "bronze quiet glow," "bronze quiet cadence"), creating a repetitive template pattern that dulls immediacy. Some phrases approach purple prose ("whispers of forgotten texts," "ash of centuries") without advancing specific meaning. The paraphrase loop between "stories walls have heard" appearing twice verbatim triggers additional deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of a post-apocalyptic historian preserving memory through physical resonance offers fresh specificity—walls that literally sing, a tilted world axis manifesting through objects. The synthesis of medieval tapestry with future setting creates non-obvious juxtaposition. The detail about grain spinning "like a compass rose" when the axis slipped shows imaginative precision. Some elements feel familiar (last human, forgotten texts) but the execution transforms them through concrete particulars.</comment>
