I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The navigator's motivation to "map the geography of loss" drives consistent choices through building the map-making engine and guiding reverse migration. Internal contradiction appears when she works "not with triumph but with steady acceptance," showing complex emotional layering. However, interiority relies on abstraction ("geography of loss") rather than concrete embodied emotion, and the character lacks specific flaws that complicate her choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when the station transforms from "conduit for outward messages" to "beacon for inward journeys," with visible cost in "every name etched into the copper coils." The accumulative/textural lens holds as moon phases, patina deepening, and nightly calls build toward the ships' arrival. Orientation anchors effectively establish the signal station setting and navigator's purpose early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The signal station with "antennae like skeletal ribs" and the censer foot's moon-linked fluctuations create vivid, purposeful setting that constrains the navigator's work rhythm. The "lattice of reclaimed wiring, old radio tubes" grounds the world in specific decay. Setting actively shapes choice through the midnight timing of calls and the station's mechanical failures, though some descriptions lean toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on mapping loss and enabling return, with escalation through the navigator's building of the map-making engine that "could translate loss into audible currents." The arrival of ships confirms success but lacks a moment where the navigator must choose between competing goods or face a genuine test. Cost appears in "the weight of every name" but remains somewhat abstract rather than forcing a concrete sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of navigating loss emerges organically through the reverse migration concept, avoiding explicit moralizing. The censer foot's patina "absorbing the sorrow of each whispered route" creates resonant accumulation. The final image of ships "turn[ing] westward" with "lanterns flickering like the censer foot's patina" offers a non-literal answer about finding home through returning to grief's origin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "cracked hush" and "skeletal ribs," creating distinct texture. POV remains stable in third-person limited, tracking the navigator's perception of the censer foot's changes and the station's deterioration. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("geography of loss," "raw solace") that feels more authorial than character-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("antennae like skeletal ribs reaching toward the indifferent sky") but suffers from repetitive abstract phrases: "geography of loss" appears four times, "raw solace" twice. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("She understood...She watched...She recorded"). Some sentences could be cut without losing meaning, particularly the explanatory passages about reverse migration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The reverse migration concept offers a fresh angle—people returning to grief's origin rather than fleeing to safety. The censer foot as navigation tool tied to moon phases creates original worldbuilding. However, the "patchwork navigator" with "eyes sewn together from half-remembered maps" feels somewhat forced as metaphor, and the resolution lacks the surprise that would elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>
