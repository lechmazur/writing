<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to discover what walls dream is consistent and deepens through discovery of the mapping technique, though internal contradiction could be more embodied. The choice to press the film negative against stone and accept the legacy's burden shows agency with visible cost ("weight of history settle like warm ash against her spine"). Character-specific perception through sound-mapping is distinctive but peaks lack fully embodied emotional complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through discovery of film technique, wall dreams, and final communal transformation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the legacy transforms from individual burden to "shared communion," with cost visible in the weight Lira carries. The piece teaches its pattern of echo-as-memory early and pays off with the walls sharing dreams, though the final extension past natural closure dilutes impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage and film negative constrain Lira's method and enable discovery—she must use the fragile negative "as a lantern" to navigate. Setting actively shapes tactics through the stone hearth, half-burned diaries, and corridor acoustics that exhale "a low hum." The climate-shifted world of perpetual mist frames the entire piece purposefully, though some descriptions lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering wall dreams) deepens through film discovery and pressing negative to stone, forcing Lira to accept the legacy's weight. The transformation from burden to communion represents meaningful deepening with cost ("weight of history settle like warm ash"). However, the extended denouement after natural closure reduces pressure, and the final communal section lacks the intensity of earlier discoveries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of collective memory and shared history emerges through concrete discovery—walls store "hopes, regrets, and the scent of rain." The transformation from individual burden to communion offers non-literal answer to whether isolation or connection defines legacy. The recurring image of walls as living histories gains weight, though the explicit statement about "collective imagination" in the final line edges toward thesis articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through sound-mapping and synesthetic translation of "visual darkness into audible resonance." Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("green-threaded artery"). The extended ending shifts to summary mode, losing the immediacy of earlier discovery beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong moments like "ghostly silhouettes of arches and doorways, each line echoing a tone" show precise imagery. However, abstract phrases accumulate ("shared responsibility to honor those silent reveries," "collective imagination that lives in every stone whisper") and the extended ending relies on summary rather than scene. Some metaphor mixing occurs between walls as dreamers and walls as histories.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Echo cartographer concept and using film negatives to map sound offers fresh angle on memory preservation. The synthesis of visual/auditory mapping through damaged film creates specific texture. However, the extended communal ending follows expected patterns, and some elements (tokens left by scholars) feel ornamental rather than essential.</comment>
