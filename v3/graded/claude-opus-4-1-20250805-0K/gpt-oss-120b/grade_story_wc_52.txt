<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to transform grief into utility is clear and embodied through the carving act, with concrete internal contradiction between containing and releasing loss. The final choice to place the lantern as a beacon shows earned transformation with visible cost. However, some interiority slides into abstract philosophizing ("grief is both here and gone, a paradox") rather than staying fully embodied, and emotional progression occasionally tells rather than shows.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the carving process, crystallizing in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the completed lantern transforms grief into guidance. The closure lands with felt cost as Mara accepts loss as tool rather than trap. However, the cost could be more visceral—the emotional price reads more as philosophical acceptance than dramatized struggle, and some causality feels convenient (the sap crystallization process).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The loft setting with its skylight, copper roofs, and rust-hued atmosphere creates a vivid, selective world that mirrors Mara's internal state. The kettle's boiling provides temporal anchor and the rain-beaded glass constrains perception effectively. The ash wood's grain "whispering of forests long felled" and the sap crystallization create texture that serves the emotional arc, though some descriptions edge toward ornamental rather than constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming grief into something useful—is clear, with escalation through the carving process as sap emerges and crystallizes. The pressure coheres under the textural lens as density increases toward closure. However, the conflict lacks external resistance; everything proceeds too smoothly without meaningful obstacles or reversals that would force harder choices or trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of transformation through craft emerges organically from the carving process, with the paradox of "here and gone" earning resonance through concrete action. The final image of the lantern as beacon effectively reweights prior material without stating a moral. The story achieves complexity through Mara's acceptance that "loss can be a tool, not a trap," though occasionally the thematic work becomes explicit rather than fully embedded in scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Mara's contemplative state, with selective perception focused on craft and memory. However, syntactic patterns become repetitive ("She [verb]" constructions dominate) and some diction drifts into elevated register that doesn't fully match a lion tamer's widow's plausible lexicon ("crystallized time," "resonant memory vault").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("rain-beaded skylight," "steam traced silver veins") but suffers from overwriting in peak beats with mixed metaphors and abstract philosophizing. Template cadence appears in multiple runs of "She [verb]" structures. Paraphrase loops occur ("grief is both here and gone"/"the paradox of here and gone could be lived"), and some figurative language strains credibility (the kettle's steam as "silver veins marking time").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh synthesis of grief-as-craft with specific details like the circus alchemists' crystallization process and the lion tamer's widow perspective. The transformation of loss into a functional lantern-beacon provides non-obvious emotional truth. However, some elements feel convenient (the sap crystallization) and the resolution tends toward the safety middle rather than taking bolder risks with the emotional complexity.</comment>
