I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through lyric repetition and pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration where the caretaker's work gains witness and validation.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The caretaker shows consistent motivation through ritualistic preservation, with embodied "foxglove regret" and systematic devotion. The traveler's arrival validates her work, creating earned change. However, interiority relies on abstract emotional labels ("violet sorrow," "bittersweet ache") rather than concrete embodied sensation, and the character lacks specific contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds through ritual repetition toward the traveler's arrival as resonant reconfiguration—the preserved names finally finding a recipient. The "who, where, when" anchors establish clearly (glass-orchid caretaker, opal library above clouds, nightly ritual). Cost is visible in the caretaker's persistent "foxglove regret" and the traveler inheriting "the weight of each name." Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the emotional cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal library setting actively shapes the ritual—narrow windows, vaulted arches, and glass orchids all participate in the sound-preservation process. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as she moves through the space. The environment constrains her work to this specific acoustic architecture where "echo of a long-forgotten song" can be caught and preserved.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving forgotten names/feelings) maintains coherent pressure through accumulative ritual. The traveler's arrival provides meaningful deepening as the preserved work finds purpose. However, escalation remains gentle rather than intensifying—the ritual repeats without increasing resistance or complication until the validating arrival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete work of preservation—memory surviving void through systematic care. The final exchange with the traveler offers resonant payoff: "ancestors he never met" crystallizes the theme of cultural memory transmission. The museum of extinct feelings serves as effective metaphor without becoming heavy-handed allegory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Consistent lyric voice with controlled rhythm, particularly in the ritual sequences. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("deserted marvels," "violet sorrow") that strains against the grounded caretaker POV. The prose maintains atmosphere but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—the caretaker notices everything with equal poetic weight rather than selective, character-specific attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dense figurative language appears in most sentences without clear pattern-teaching ("foxglove regret," "violet sorrow," "glass-orchid petal" comparisons), creating overwriting issues. Template cadence runs appear: multiple "She [verb]" constructions in sequence. Information density is high and the piece maintains momentum, but the elevated diction and metaphor density (-0.7) significantly impact clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The museum of extinct feelings offers a fresh conceptual frame, and the glass-orchid caretaker role feels specific. The synthesis of sound preservation with emotional archaeology creates non-obvious resonance. However, some elements feel ornamental rather than essential (the "foxglove regret" metaphor adds atmosphere but little specificity).</comment>
