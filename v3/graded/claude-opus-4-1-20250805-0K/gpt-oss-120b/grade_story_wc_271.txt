<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's trauma and coping mechanisms are embodied through somatic markers and the "pearl of stillness," with clear internal motivation driving her journey toward healing. However, the character lacks meaningful internal contradiction or struggle in the present moment—her path feels predetermined rather than conflicted, and the final promise/resolution arrives without sufficient on-page resistance or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the protagonist moving through the arboretum while processing trauma. The ending achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—she chooses to continue living with her grief rather than being consumed by it. However, the cost remains largely abstract ("ready to plant her own beacon of hope") rather than concrete, and the piece lacks a decisive present-moment pressure point that would elevate the closure beyond therapeutic processing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The arboretum setting actively participates through sensory details (salt wind, pine, rosemary) that anchor the protagonist's somatic healing practice. The cliff edge provides spatial pressure for the final moment, and environmental elements like the wind chimes and oak sapling enable key beats of reflection and commitment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to live with catastrophic trauma—is clear but remains static throughout. There's no meaningful escalation or tightening; the protagonist moves through the space processing the same grief without encountering new pressure or obstacles that would force adaptation or deeper choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of anchoring "optimism in realism" emerges through the garden's resilience metaphor and the protagonist's somatic practice. The pearl of stillness concept provides a non-literal answer to surviving trauma. However, the thematic resolution feels overly neat, with explicit statements like "I will remember the laughter, I will honor the loss" that approach therapeutic prescription rather than earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm and selective perception focused on sensory anchoring. However, some passages drift into elevated diction ("tapestry of pine," "orb of calm") that occasionally disconnects from the traumatized character's immediate experience, and repetitive constructions ("She..." openings) create monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft shows competence with varied sentence lengths and sensory specificity. However, several passages contain abstract metaphorical language that slows momentum ("the world seemed a map of loss and hope"), and phrases like "quietly talented gait" feel forced. The final third accumulates abstract declarations that weaken propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The drone strike wedding survivor premise offers a specific contemporary trauma, and the somatic healing approach provides a fresh angle. However, the execution relies on familiar therapeutic frameworks and nature-as-healing metaphors without significant transformation, resulting in a competent but not distinctive treatment.</comment>
