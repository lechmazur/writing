<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to preserve and transmit ancestral sounds is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied actions (trembling fingers, kneeling with the child). The internal drive manifests through specific micro-choices under the pressure of cultural loss. However, the transformation from vagrant to cultural bridge feels somewhat rushed in the final beats, lacking the intermediate struggle that would fully earn such a profound shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with density increasing through the collection of sounds in jars, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the child receives the ancestral lullaby. The cost is felt through the poet's "lonesome splendor" transforming into "shared hymn," with clear before/after legibility. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical transition between finding the music box and beginning the jar collection method.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The feral loft transforms from abandoned space to "chapel of resonance," with vivid sensory detail ("sand-torn wood," "dust motes to dance like tiny planets"). The setting actively constrains and enables choices—the loft's isolation allows the sound collection, while its cracks become "luminous ribbons" that draw the child. The dunes themselves function as active participants, "whispering" the mission and "rolling melodies back."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each captured sound enriches the collection ("tinny waltz" to "child's laughter" to "migrating gull"). The dominant stake—preserving generational memory—tightens when the poet steps onto the sand with jar in hand, foreclosing his solitary existence. The cost manifests when he shares his collected treasures with the child, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of capturing ephemeral sounds in glass, avoiding abstract philosophizing about memory and heritage. The music box's transformation from "abandoned" to acknowledged participant creates resonance without stating a moral. The final image of the child as "a link, a translator of the dunes' ancient chorus" reweights all prior collecting as purposeful rather than eccentric.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical voice with controlled rhythm ("ragged coat billowing like a sigh") and apt metaphorical language that serves the accumulative mode. The perceptual signature shows selective attention to sound and texture over visual detail. Some register elevation in places ("lonesome splendor," "chapel of resonance") slightly strains against the vagrant poet persona, though the overall texture coheres.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong sensory specificity. However, several instances of elevated diction feel forced ("positively wistful" appears twice, "lonesome splendor" twice) and some metaphors stretch ("dust motes...like tiny planets in a far-away sky"). The repetition of "sweeten" feels mechanical rather than pattern-taught. These artifacts don't obscure closure but prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound preservation as physical act rather than metaphor, with glass jars as unexpected vessels for memory. The transformation of a vagrant poet into cultural bridge through concrete action rather than epiphany shows originality. The specific detail of teaching the child to "uncork the sound" elevates beyond generic memory-preservation narratives, though some elements (music box discovery) feel convenient.</comment>
