I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and symbolic resonance rather than strict causality, culminating in a transformation through the ink's alchemy.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as the "honest child of a notorious con artist" creates productive tension, and her active waiting shows agency through deliberate stillness. However, her internal experience relies heavily on abstract concepts ("rigid thinking," "fluid possibilities") rather than embodied emotion, and the transformation at the end feels asserted rather than dramatized through concrete struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where bureaucratic rigidity dissolves through the ink's mathematical proof, with clear before/after states. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we see the transformation's effect but not what Mara sacrifices or risks, and the resolution arrives too smoothly without earned struggle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The funeral home setting effectively pressures the narrative through its "lilies and stale incense," creating atmosphere that enables the breach. The ink pot functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final transformation, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("whispering shadows").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving her lineage to gain asylum—is clear, but escalation remains static as Mara simply waits for the right moment. The story lacks meaningful tightening or deepening beyond the single action of creating the contract, and no visible price is paid for the transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of transforming deception into honesty through "mathematics of a fair trade" emerges organically from the concrete action. However, the resolution feels too neat—the bureaucrats' walls simply dissolve without exploring the complexity of power or showing genuine resistance to change.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled rhythm ("Each sigh was a subtle vibration, a tremor that Mara felt in the soles of her feet"). The narrative voice effectively modulates between action and reflection, though it occasionally drifts into abstraction that distances us from Mara's immediate experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, several instances of abstract phrasing dilute immediacy ("living calculus of moral exchange," "visible expression of the mathematics"), and the metaphorical density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies the concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of magical ink that can mathematically prove fairness offers genuine originality, synthesizing con artistry with honest mathematics in unexpected ways. The funeral home as site of transformation and the image of equations glowing like "veins of gold" create memorable specificity.</comment>
