<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The diminutive titan's motivation to unmask the pretender is clear and drives consistent action, but internal contradiction is limited to "trembling fingers" during the pellet scene. The character's "regally unpretentious" power creates some tension but lacks embodied emotional complexity during key moments. The final choice to declare sovereignty rules carries weight, yet the journey lacks the visceral internal struggle that would elevate characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with the pretender unmasked and the temple collapsing—a decisive change with visible cost as "ancient stones sang a low hymn of graceful collapse." The causal chain from finding the pellet through following cryptic messages to confronting the false crown is clear. However, the spectral emergence feels slightly convenient, and the cost remains more atmospheric than personally felt by the protagonist.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient temple library functions as more than backdrop—its "vaulted aisles," "endless catalog," and ultimate collapse constrain and enable the titan's quest. Sensory details like "the scent of old papyrus and inevitable collapse" and "iron gall ink pellet" create specificity. The setting actively participates in closure as the temple's collapse mirrors the pretender's fall, though some descriptions lean toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and maintains coherence. Escalation occurs through the pellet's revelation, the cryptic map, and the crown confrontation, with the temple's collapse providing a meaningful tightening. However, the spectral pretender's emergence lacks earned resistance, and the resolution feels predetermined rather than hard-won through the protagonist's agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete struggle between legitimate sovereignty and "borrowed" power, with the rune of drift serving as both literal tool and thematic anchor. The ending's "power taken by deceit would always crumble under the weight of truth" resonates without heavy-handed moralizing. The graceful collapse motif effectively links physical and thematic dissolution, though some passages edge toward explicit theme statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "diminutive titan" and "regally unpretentious" establishing a mythic register. The perceptual signature shows in selective details like "faded glyphs that whispered" and "starlight" emergence. However, some passages drift into elevated diction ("planetary presence," "inevitable collapse") that occasionally obscures the POV's grounding, and syntactic variety could better modulate with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("iron gall ink pellet," "cracks spidered outward") but suffers from repetitive structures and occasional overwriting. Phrases like "hushed cathedral of stone and dust" and "pause of shifting constellations" lean purple. Multiple instances of template cadence appear ("He + verb" patterns), and some metaphors strain credibility (library as "cathedral," presence as "planetary").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story transforms the quest narrative through specific elements like the iron gall ink pellet as truth-revealer and the rune of drift as both tool and symbol. The "diminutive titan" concept offers fresh contrast, and the library setting provides particularity. However, the core pretender-to-throne plot follows familiar patterns without sufficient transformation, and the resolution's moral calculus remains somewhat conventional.</comment>
