I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration where dust becomes storyteller.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "teach dust to tell stories" manifests through concrete action as she transcribes the pirate broadcast, though her internal conflict remains understated. The transformation from solitary copyist to bridge between silence and song earns its arc through accumulated detail rather than dramatic reversal. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "thistled calm demeanor" that recurs without evolving embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: dust particles literally trace music through the air, fulfilling Mara's desire while the city's story famine ends. Cost registers through "three years" of silence and the implicit price of piracy. The accumulative structure coheres as each luminous detail builds toward the transformation, though the midpoint broadcast arrival could tighten causally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ember alcove and mist create atmospheric pressure while the shortwave radio's glow actively constrains and enables action. Sensory detail layers effectively ("flickering like fireflies trapped in amber"). The dust particles evolve from passive atmosphere to active story-carriers, though some descriptive phrases edge toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (Mara's copying) to communal (city's theatrical revival) through the pirate broadcast's arrival. The story famine provides background pressure while Mara's choice to amplify the broadcast carries risk. The conflict remains relatively gentle, with cost implied rather than dramatized through direct opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of dust from forgotten particles to story-carriers, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of dust as storyteller resonates without stating its meaning. The recurring luminous/glow motif accumulates purposefully, though "thistled calm" feels less integrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, though occasional phrases like "thistled calm demeanor" and "secretly luminous" feel artificially elevated. POV remains stable with Mara as focalizer. The perceptual signature of noticing light and sound patterns distinguishes the narrator's attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("fireflies trapped in amber") but suffers from repetitive constructions and some overwriting. "Thistled calm" appears three times without clear meaning; "secretly luminous" recurs without justification for the secrecy. Template phrases like "she sensed," "she felt," "she recognized" accumulate, and the adjective density occasionally obscures clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of teaching dust to tell stories through pirate radio broadcasts offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of musical transcription with atmospheric transformation avoids familiar templates. Some elements feel consciously literary (ember alcove, mysterious broadcasts) but the specific execution elevates beyond stock atmosphere.</comment>
