<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "compress eternity into a moment" drives consistent action, though internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied. The final choice to continue printing moments shows agency but lacks the visceral cost or contradiction needed for higher bands. Character remains somewhat archetypal despite ink-stained fingers and cryptic role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through frost patterns, ruptures, and cascading transformations. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the library transforms into "a living lattice" with each pane "a portal to a moment of eternal now," showing visible change. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—Mara gains her desire without meaningful sacrifice or trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass orchard library and frost patterns create vivid, purposeful imagery that constrains Mara's method (arranging frost spirals, pressing the bottle at center). The setting actively participates in closure as "each pane now a portal," though some descriptions lean ornamental ("frost-kissed panes"). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through the transformation sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Escalation occurs through accumulative pressure: whisper seeps into ink, library shivers, books unfurl, reality reconfigures. The dominant stake (compressing eternity) faces one meaningful deepening when "rustling awakenings erupted in a cascade." However, Mara achieves her goal without visible price—the "rupture" brings only positive transformation, undermining tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through destabilization emerges through concrete imagery (bottled whisper as catalyst, perfect systems breaking to reveal wonder). The ending reweights the opening's static perfection into dynamic possibility. However, thematic resolution feels too neat—"even perfect systems can be broken to reveal true wonder" approaches explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Mara notices everything with equal poetic elevation. Prose rhythm doesn't modulate with pressure; the rupture sequence maintains the same register as quieter moments. No dialogue limits character voice distinction. Some phrases feel committee-written: "negotiating reality itself."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Significant paraphrase loops damage momentum: "rustling awakening/awakenings" appears 7 times with minimal variation; "compress eternity into a moment" repeats 3 times verbatim. Template cadence pervades: "She [verb], [participial phrase]" structure dominates. Mixed metaphors clash (whisper is both "liquid darkness" and generates "rustling"). Information density suffers from ornamental description over advancement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The core concept of a library floating on clouds with glass that can encode eternity offers fresh imagery. The synthesis of letterpress printing with temporal compression shows originality. However, execution relies on abstract philosophical gestures ("negotiating reality," "renegotiating its own rules") rather than specific lived detail, limiting distinction.</comment>
