<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation as peace negotiator is clear but relies on generic traits ("weathered reputation," "operatively gentle") rather than embodied contradiction. The chieftains' transformation from armor-clanging warriors to sword-laying peacemakers happens too smoothly without earned internal struggle. Final choice to lay down swords lacks visible personal cost for individual characters.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with ritual elements building toward reconciliation, but the closure lacks visible cost—swords are laid down without dramatized sacrifice or loss. The transformation from war to peace occurs through Lira's reading of terms rather than earned causality. Who/where/when anchored adequately early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ancient terrace setting provides functional staging for the ritual, with sensory details (firelight, jasmine, cricket chorus) supporting atmosphere. The altar and its marble/ebony contrast work symbolically but don't constrain choices. Setting remains largely static backdrop rather than active pressure on decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (ending war through negotiation) is clear but faces no meaningful opposition or complication—chieftains acquiesce after hearing terms without dramatized resistance. No escalation occurs; the ritual proceeds smoothly from clipboard placement to sword surrender. The "price of redemption" is declared but never tested through concrete trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through collective willingness emerges through the ritual but relies heavily on abstract statements ("price of redemption," "anchor ideals in practice") rather than earned particulars. The ebony/marble contrast and sword-laying gesture carry symbolic weight but the transformation feels unearned. Final sunrise image attempts resonance but lacks the cost that would deepen meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains consistency through Lira's perspective with some evocative phrasing ("sky that spun lazily," "operatively gentle"). However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("fragile magnificence of humanity's attempt") and relies on abstract emotional labels. No dialogue limits voice distinction opportunities.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing around redemption/reconciliation concepts and overwrought figurative language ("celestial choreography," "parched hearts of warriors"). Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("price of redemption" variations, "operatively gentle" repetitions). Some effective imagery fights against purple prose tendencies and conceptual redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The peace negotiation scenario follows familiar templates without transformation through specific detail. The ritual structure and symbolic gestures (sword-laying, clipboard-as-treaty) feel generic. No surprising turns or fresh angles emerge from the predictable arc of warriors choosing peace through gentle persuasion.</comment>
