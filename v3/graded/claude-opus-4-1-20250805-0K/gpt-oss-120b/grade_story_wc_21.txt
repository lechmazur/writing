I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and symbolic actions toward a resonant reconfiguration where suppressed histories are finally broadcast.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through "searing reverie" that drives her quest. Her transformation from solitary archivist to broadcaster of suppressed truths shows earned change with visible cost. The sand-carvers function effectively as pressure-applying secondary characters, though internal contradiction could be more visceral in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara broadcasts the decoded entries, transforming the desert's silence into "an echo of justice." The accumulative lens holds as density builds through symbols (beach debris arrangements, obsidian lagoon, violet light) toward this crystallized moment. Cost is visible in the "weight of countless suppressed voices" and the forged "covenant" between sand and sky.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating library and obsidian lagoon create vivid, constraining environments that shape Mara's choices. The beach debris arrangement requirement forces specific tactile interaction with setting. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("brass hull humming like a distant prayer"), though some descriptions edge toward ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: from finding letters to decoding the diary's retrocognitive trap to negotiating with sand-carvers to descending to the lagoon. Each stage narrows options and deepens commitment. The final broadcast carries visible cost as "every dune trembled" - though agency could be stronger in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between official record and suppressed truth. The obsidian lagoon as repository of silenced testimony creates resonant subtext. The final image of the zeppelin's brass panels glowing violet effectively reweights earlier material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "memory into flame" and "echoing cathedrals." POV remains stable with Mara throughout. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("retrocognitively trapped," "temporal snare") in ways that feel more authorial than character-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("brass hull humming like a distant prayer") but suffers from density issues - nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Some phrases edge toward purple ("searing reverie turned into a resolve"). Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a retrocognitive diary that "only released its secrets when the reader remembered the future" offers genuine originality. The synthesis of civil rights archiving with fantastical elements (zeppelin library, sand-carvers) creates a fresh angle. The beach debris communication system shows inventive world-building.</comment>
