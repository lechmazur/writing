<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to transform dispute into renaissance is clear, but her interior life remains abstract with phrases like "eyes reflecting both triumph and regret" rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to keep a shard fragment gestures toward complexity but lacks the visceral cost needed for higher scores.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the mirror-storm ceremony, but closure lacks decisive cost—the dispute simply "dissolved into a collaborative chorus" without showing what anyone sacrifices. The transformation happens too easily, with no visible price paid for this cultural rebirth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid with its "marble arches etched with forgotten hymns" creates vivid atmosphere, and the mirrors become functional setting that enables the transformation. However, spatial choreography during the key ceremony remains vague—we don't see bodies moving through space or handling objects with specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The central conflict over the shard's meaning sets clear stakes, but resolution comes through Lira's uncontested plan rather than escalating pressure. The dispute vanishes without resistance once the light show begins, lacking the tightening or deepening that would demonstrate genuine conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of transformation through art emerges from the mirror ceremony and recurring "burnished sorrow," but the final paragraph explicitly states the thesis: "the true revolution was no longer a battle of arms but a symphony of mirrors." This direct moralizing undercuts the earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The elevated register maintains consistency but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Lira could be any revolutionary on any baroque asteroid. POV modesty fails when the narrator asserts what "visitors from neighboring worlds" experience without showing their actual arrival or departure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing pervades the text: "burnished sorrow" appears three times, template constructions like "She [verb], [participle]" recur, and abstract phrases like "catalyst for creation" and "symphony of mirrors" replace concrete imagery. The prose reaches for lyricism but achieves ornamental density without precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting and mirror-refraction ceremony offer some originality, but the core premise—art healing political division—follows a familiar template. The transformation mechanism feels convenient rather than earned through specific character or world logic.</comment>
