<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's blindness creates genuine constraint that shapes her tactile repair methods and water-refraction technique. Her tender dedication to the hummingbird contrasts effectively with the industrial depot setting. The character's expertise coexists with vulnerability, though the final paragraph's philosophical turn ("each repaired wing was a promise") edges toward abstraction rather than embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with sensory layering building toward Mara's completion of the repair. The closure lands as Earned Stasis—she returns to her bench for the next iteration—but the cost remains mostly conceptual ("broken things and new horizons"). The piece anchors who/where/when clearly by ~100 words, and the repair sequence creates a complete arc, though without a decisive change that alters Mara's options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot with its steel girders, oil lamps, and ambient fog creates atmospheric constraint for the drone's navigation. The water basin becomes a functional tool enabling Mara's blind repair work through light refraction. Sensory details (vibration through workbench, soft whirr of motor) effectively ground Mara's non-visual perception, making her blindness tactile rather than abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repairing the drone's wing—progresses steadily but without meaningful complication or reversal. The repair succeeds smoothly ("sealing the tear as seamlessly as a bird's feather mends"), with the only tension being whether the patch will hold, which it does. The ship's departure provides atmospheric pressure but doesn't constrain Mara's choices or create cost beyond the routine challenge of blind repair work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of finding precision through unconventional perception emerges organically from Mara's blind repair methods. The water refraction technique embodies this concretely rather than stating it. However, the final paragraphs drift toward explicit thematic statements ("a bridge between broken things and new horizons," "blind sight could craft luminous futures") that diminish the subtlety earned through the scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, particularly in passages like "The shimmering beams traced delicate patterns that mimicked the hummingbird's natural flight path." Mara's whispered "Feel the lift" carries appropriate tenderness. Some elevated diction ("magnetic calm," "luminous futures") occasionally strains against the industrial setting, but the voice coheres around Mara's artisan perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied sentence lengths and sensory specificity ("soft hum rose from the drone, signaling that the patch held"). However, "magnetic calm" appears three times, creating unnecessary repetition. The final two paragraphs contain abstract philosophizing ("each repaired wing was a promise to the world") that dilutes the concrete imagery. Some filter constructions ("Mara felt," "She listened") could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The blind artisan using water refraction to repair delicate drone wings offers a fresh angle on disability and craft. The specific repair method feels inventive and grounded in physical possibility. However, the philosophical framing in the final paragraphs ("sanctuary where blind sight could craft luminous futures") retreats toward familiar inspiration territory rather than maintaining the story's tactile specificity.</comment>
