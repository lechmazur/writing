<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The inspector's purposeful curiosity drives his mission, but his internal state remains abstract ("melancholy of dawn wrapped around him like a shawl"). The character makes procedural choices (setting up equipment, timing the photograph) yet lacks contradictory impulses or embodied emotion during the crucial moment. His final whispered hope feels unearned without prior struggle between competing values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the inspector photographing the sand grain as dawn breaks, achieving closure through Conceptual Repricing—the grain transforms from relic to "captured breath of time." Cost appears in "tremor of grief" knowing colonies will reclaim the mineral, though this emotional price arrives suddenly without prior buildup. The chemical timing mechanism creates a ticking clock that adds modest pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lunar summit setting with basalt ridges and Earth-rise creates vivid specificity ("canvas of soft gold and lingering shadows"). The chemical reaction's "pale plume of vapor rising like a ghost" integrates setting with action. The environment constrains the photography through precise solar positioning, making the summit location essential to capturing the grain at dawn's first light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—photographing the sand grain before it vanishes—faces minimal opposition beyond timing constraints. The chemical countdown provides modest escalation through its five-minute window, but no meaningful tightening occurs. The inspector completes his task without complication or forced trade-offs, and the "tremor of grief" arrives without prior pressure building toward that emotional cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of preserving memory against inevitable loss emerges through the sand grain holding "the memory of every midnight" and the photograph outlasting "the fleeting glow." The final transformation of the grain from relic to "captured breath of time" offers resonance. However, the explicit moralizing in the whispered speech ("May the grain's story travel farther...") and the abstract "melancholy of sunrise" undercut subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some evocative moments ("thin silver glow of a nascent Earth sunrise"). However, register drift appears in academic phrasing ("consortium of archivists," "elegy") that clashes with the intimate mission. The inspector's perceptual signature lacks distinction—he observes professionally but without character-specific bias or selection that would reveal personality through what he notices versus ignores.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades peak moments: "dawning hush" appears four times, creating a template loop; abstract descriptors like "melancholy of dawn" and "breath of the world before sunrise" lack concrete grounding. The whispered speech contains three consecutive sentences beginning with "May," creating rhythmic monotony. Information density suffers from paraphrase loops ("soft wind stirred the dust" followed immediately by "world seemed to hold its sigh").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The concept of preserving a sand grain's accumulated temporal memory offers modest freshness, and the chemical timing mechanism provides specific detail. However, the execution relies on abstract poeticism ("breath of the world," "heartbeat of the universe") rather than grounded particulars. The derivative "last photograph before extinction" premise receives only surface transformation through the lunar setting.</comment>
