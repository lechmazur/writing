<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's involuntary truthfulness creates consistent character texture and her motivation to preserve wonder drives the final beats effectively. However, the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction during peak moments—her confession to the drone feels declarative rather than wrestled with. The transformation from loss to renewal earns its cost through the hive failure's weight, though emotional progression could layer more complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the echo revelation serving as Conceptual Repricing that reweights the tower's purpose and the hive failure's meaning. Closure lands with felt cost—the city's wound transforms into renewal through Mara's truth-telling. The riddle-to-key-to-drone sequence maintains causality, though the matchbox's sudden appearance lacks earlier grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lightning tower and its amber-veined illumination create vivid atmosphere that directly enables the story's resolution. The lacquer box's "oily sheen" and the tower's "nectar dusk" glow establish consistent sensory texture. The tower functions as more than backdrop—its hidden compartment and glass rods actively shape the climactic discovery and final ceremonial gathering.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring wonder to routine after the hive failure—escalates through Mara's discovery sequence with the matchbox riddle forcing action. The echo revelation deepens rather than reverses, reframing loss as necessary pause. Cost is visible in the "wound on the city's heart" and Mara's compelled truthfulness, though pressure could tighten more sharply between riddle and resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The echo concept elegantly answers why mechanical precision failed—the city needed to hear its own voice return. Theme emerges through concrete images: dead drones becoming memory in bell chimes, citizens gathering in "quiet ceremony." The final image of Mara sealing the riddle "knowing its secret would bloom when needed again" resonates without moralizing, though some passages edge toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm—"the tower's purpose was to harvest the stray bolts that fell like rain on the dead streets below." POV remains stable with Mara's perception filtering all detail. However, diction occasionally drifts elevated ("nectar dusk of the tower's glow") beyond what her toll keeper role suggests, and some constructions feel writerly rather than organic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of striking imagery—"lightning collection tower hummed with dormant energy"—with generally clean syntax. Information density is moderate, though phrases like "wound on the city's heart" and "weaving wonder back" lean toward abstraction. The recurring "nectar/honey" metaphor maintains coherence but appears frequently enough to edge toward overwriting in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of failed mechanical drones with the concept of echo as the city's returning voice offers genuine freshness. The riddle mechanism and the drone's electric glyph response show inventive detail. While the wonder-versus-routine theme is familiar, its execution through the toll keeper's enforced truthfulness and the tower's transformation creates specific texture that transcends template.</comment>
