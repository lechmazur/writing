<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Selene's motivation for seeking "half-lit epiphanies" and practicing "ethical storytelling" remains abstract throughout, never manifesting in concrete choices under pressure. The piece declares her beliefs about reversing narrative hierarchies but shows no internal contradiction or cost when she leaves the dome unchanged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>No closure lands on the page—Selene simply leaves the dome with unchanged intentions to continue her puppet shows. The accumulative lens attempts to build toward revelation through the campfire stick's glow, but the "half-lit epiphany" about puppet strings as lifelines creates no before/after change or visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The radar dome with its inward-facing dishes creates a distinctive setting that mirrors the introspective theme. However, the environment never constrains Selene's choices or enables specific actions that affect outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation occurs—Selene enters seeking epiphanies, arranges dishes, watches fire glow, and leaves with the same intentions. The "revelation" about puppet strings creates no pressure or cost, and her plan to continue puppet shows remains unchanged from the opening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of "ethical storytelling" and reversing narrative hierarchies emerges through repeated assertion rather than dramatized struggle. The final image of Selene walking toward seedy bars with "questions" and "ethical wonder" states the theme explicitly without earning it through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent literary register with phrases like "meteor hush" and "ember-kissed tip," but this elevated diction feels performative rather than emerging from Selene's specific perception. No dialogue tests voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors ("meteor hush," "campfire story stick," "strings of conscience unspooling like ribbons of starlight") that prioritize ornament over clarity. Template cadence appears in "She lifted...She imagined...She let..." sequences, and abstract phrases like "ethical wonder" and "soft, half-lit chorus of truth" blur rather than sharpen meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept of puppet shows as ethical storytelling and the reversed radar dishes listening to the past offer fresh angles. However, the execution relies on abstract declaration rather than specific dramatization, making the piece feel like a meditation on themes rather than a story.</comment>
