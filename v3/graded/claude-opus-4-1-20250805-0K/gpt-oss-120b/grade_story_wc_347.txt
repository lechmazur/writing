<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The caretaker's motivation is clear through the "bargain struck in whispered rain" and consistent duty, with embodied contradictions between reluctance and purpose. The final choice to place the nut shows earned agency with visible cost ("bitter sweetness that settles like ash on my tongue"). However, interiority relies on abstract descriptors ("graceless beauty," "jagged elegance") rather than concrete embodiment, and the character's specific traits beyond duty remain thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as pattern accumulates toward the ritual's completion with clear Resonant Reconfiguration - travelers escape while the curse persists. Cost is visible in "the orchard will sigh again tomorrow, demanding a new caretaker" showing cyclical price. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the blueprint concept which never fully crystallizes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth setting constrains movement and creates urgency through frost deadline, while mechanical birds provide atmospheric pressure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("metal wings humming a mournful lullaby," "frost threatens to seize the air"). The hollowed stump altar serves as crucial spatial anchor for the ritual, directly enabling closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear dominant stake of completing the ritual before frost with escalation through approaching the altar and placing the nut. The frost deadline creates genuine temporal pressure that narrows options. However, no meaningful opposition or complication challenges the progression - the protagonist simply walks to the stump and places the nut without obstacles or trade-offs beyond the already-established curse cycle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical sacrifice emerges through the ritual's repetition and "graceless beauty" of helping others while remaining trapped. The blueprint motif effectively bridges forgotten knowledge and present action. Final image of the wound that "will never fully heal" resonates without stating a moral. Slight abstract tendency in phrasing ("jagged elegance," "graceless ballet") prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent POV with distinctive voice through unusual constructions ("perched on the cliffside labyrinth," "impressions without touching"). Perceptual signature shows in selective attention to mechanical birds and frost. Some register elevation inconsistent with established voice ("reluctant approval," "indifferent precision") and occasional filter-verb reliance ("I watch," "feeling") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is moderate with most lines advancing atmosphere or ritual progression. Template cadence appears in "I watch...I watch...I turn away" pattern and abstract descriptors ("graceless beauty," "jagged elegance") recur without added precision. Minor paraphrase loop with "graceless beauty/graceless ballet" repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cursed orchard with mechanical guardian birds and the wind-impression ritual creates distinctive world. The cyclical caretaker system and "blueprint hidden in a nut" show imaginative premise. Execution of "impressions without touching, tracing patterns in the wind" offers original magical mechanism. Some reliance on abstract beauty/wound metaphors prevents higher score.</comment>
