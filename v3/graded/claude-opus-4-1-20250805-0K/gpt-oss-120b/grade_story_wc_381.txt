I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination**: This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases and pattern builds toward a resonant reconfiguration. The ritual's progression creates a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake (preventing catastrophe through silence-mapping).

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The summoner demonstrates clear motivation through embodied action ("cradled the delicate paper relic," "feeling its edges pulse"), and her internal state manifests through concrete ritual steps. The choice to use the crane's wing carries implied cost (this rare relic), though the internal contradiction and struggle could be more visceral during the peak moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the prophecy sealed "within the wing's quiet glow" and the world stepping "into the smoothed hush." The accumulative structure builds coherently through ritual stages, with cost visible in the irreversible transformation of the sacred origami. Minor orientation wobble with "whispered secrets" timeframe but recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory layering ("pine and distant rain," "molten glass," "luminous arcs") creates a lived-in nocturnal space that actively shapes the ritual—the brook mirrors starlight, fireflies trace protective patterns. The setting constrains and enables the magical working through specific environmental anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as each ritual stage tightens toward completion—from placing the wing, to breathing the hush outward, to the final sealing. The cost manifests in the wing's transformation and the world's permanent alteration ("the code would remain unread"), though agency could be tested more sharply.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "mapping silence"—finding power in quietude rather than force. The final image of stars honoring her vow resonantly reweights the opening's solitary figure, creating meaning through accumulation rather than statement. The smoothed hush becomes both method and philosophy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains mystical register with controlled diction ("terrestrially cosmic conduit," "lattice of calm"). Rhythm modulates effectively with scene pressure, accelerating during the ritual's climax. Some elevated phrases border on purple ("tranquil blaze of purpose") but generally serve the otherworldly tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("incandescent glow," "luminous arcs," "tranquil blaze" in close proximity). Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, ritual progress, or stakes. Minor redundancy in describing the hush's spreading effect reduces momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Eastern mysticism (origami crane) with Western fantasy (summoner, prophecy) creates an original magical system where silence becomes active force. The concept of "mapping silence" as protective magic offers genuine novelty, and the ritual's specific mechanics feel inevitable rather than arbitrary.</comment>
