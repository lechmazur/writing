I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This operates as an Accumulative/Textural piece, building density through sensory mapping, the elm leaf's transformation, and the final chorus of caves. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the map maker realizes her role is "to amplify the silence that already lived within them."

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The map maker's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—recording scent/pressure/tremor, activating the fossil, creating heat-mapped emotions. Her final realization about amplifying silence rather than speaking for others shows genuine internal shift with cost (waiting through human hibernation). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("factually mystical") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she understands "to become the voice of the unknown was not to speak for others, but to amplify the silence." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward the caves singing. Cost is visible in her patient waiting through hibernation cycles. Slight opacity around the humans' hibernation mechanics prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The coastal cave network functions as active setting—its "labyrinthine" nature, mineral filaments connecting with leaf veins, walls that shimmer and breathe. The elm leaf fossil constrains and enables her work as "transitional object." Sensory specificity excels: "droplets of vapor that rose like lanterns," caves that "inhale her purpose."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes build through accumulation: fossil activation → water vapor rising → cave walls shimmering → final network pulse. The dominant stake (becoming voice of the unknown) deepens when she discovers it means amplifying rather than speaking. Cost appears in her year-long wait, though the pressure could tighten more decisively in middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transitional object bridging "forest above with the abyss below." The final insight about amplifying existing silence rather than imposing voice resonates without moralizing. The elm leaf's journey from fossil to "living conduit" to "solitary star" creates layered meaning about preservation and transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm: "traced the hidden currents of light," "parchment of stone." POV stays stable with the map maker. Some elevated diction ("factually mystical," "transitional object") occasionally strains against the mystical tone but serves the conceptual frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery: "droplets of vapor that rose like lanterns," "caves sang, a chorus of forgotten tides." Information density generally strong. Deductions for repetitive "factually mystical" and some abstract patches ("voice of the unknown" repeated without variation). The "elk leaf" typo near end breaks polish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sensory mapping with mystical ecology creates distinctive world. The heat-mapping of emotions recorded from cave walls, the fossil that glows when warmed, the year-long human hibernation—all feel specific and inevitable. The concept of mapping silence rather than imposing meaning offers genuine insight.</comment>
