I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered imagery and repetition toward a resonant reconfiguration of the narrator's understanding of endings.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation crystallizes through embodied details like "skin felt thinner" and concrete gestures with the lace parasol tip. The transformation from seeking death to "hearing the quiet final chords that guide a soul home" tracks causally, though some interiority edges toward therapy-speak ("gentle acceptance of their approach").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the narrator's realization that "solace is not the absence of endings, but the gentle acceptance of their approach" - a genuine conceptual repricing with emotional cost. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building through repeated imagery (fold in patience, windborne solace). Minor deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the marina setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina creates genuine constraint - the "cracked wooden piers," "icy water," and storm wreckage shape the narrator's movements and choices. Sensory detail filters through POV effectively ("pale amber that seemed to breathe"). The lace parasol tip functions as micro-setting that charges the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation rather than reversal - from seeking death to finding meaning in disaster relief to understanding endings differently. The "fold in patience" evolves from mysterious sensation to understood metaphor. Cost remains somewhat abstract despite the emotional weight; the narrator's transformation lacks a concrete price beyond philosophical shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the recurring "fold in patience" and "sound of endings" without explicit moralizing until the final line. The lace parasol tip accumulates meaning from heirloom to "fragile compass" to final gratitude object. Final paragraph edges toward theme statement but the earned resonance mostly compensates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice with controlled rhythm ("each broken hull, each splintered mast, sang a low dirge"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("susurrus," "windborne solace") fits the contemplative tone. Perceptual signature clear in how the narrator notices endings everywhere - in ice, wind, wreckage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("sunrise over the drift-ice marina painted the cracked wooden piers") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around key concepts. "Fold in patience" appears 7 times, "sound of endings" 4 times, "windborne solace" 3 times - this repetition serves the accumulative structure but creates some density drag. Several abstract constructions ("the elusive cadence that marked a life's final paragraph") reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "euthanasia tourist" seeking endings through disaster relief volunteering offers fresh conceptual territory. The transformation of death-seeking into finding solace in helping others navigate endings shows genuine complexity. The fold metaphor as "not a crack but a gentle bend" provides non-obvious insight.</comment>
