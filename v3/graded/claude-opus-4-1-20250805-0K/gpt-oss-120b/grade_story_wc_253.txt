<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to create "lightness in grief" under the happiness mandate is clear but her interiority remains abstract ("emotional void inside her expand"). The moral ambiguity of her performance is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. Her final choice to leave the baton and bouquet lacks visible personal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern and cadence shifts building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the closure's cost remains conceptual rather than felt—"a silence that now seemed less imposed and more chosen" doesn't show what Mara sacrifices or risks. The happiness mandate context is underutilized as active pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The farmhouse setting with looming turbines creates effective atmosphere and the turbines' shadows racing across walls during the whittling provides dynamic texture. Cedar shavings and dried flower scent engage multiple senses. However, the setting doesn't constrain Mara's choices—she could whittle anywhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of creating art under enforced happiness lacks concrete pressure—no enforcement appears, no consequences threaten. Mara's whittling proceeds without opposition or complication. The "morally ambiguous purpose" never faces a test that would force trade-offs or demonstrate cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of finding "lightness in grief" emerges through the whittling metaphor and dried flowers, avoiding direct statement. However, the exploration remains surface-level without complexity—grief and joy coexist but don't genuinely conflict. The final whisper about "quiet redemption" approaches thematic echo territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. However, Mara's voice lacks distinctiveness—phrases like "morally ambiguous purpose" and "quiet transformation" read as authorial rather than character-filtered. The theatrical narration she performs is summarized rather than rendered in her actual voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Severe repetition issues undermine momentum: "remade hush" appears twice, "morally ambiguous" twice, "emotional void" twice, "lightness in grief" three times, "dried flowers/bouquet" six times. Template phrasing pervades: "She whispered to the dried flowers," "She whispered to the empty rooms." The abstract register ("morally ambiguous purpose," "quiet transformation") creates distance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The happiness mandate dystopia offers a potentially fresh angle but execution relies on familiar tropes without transformation. Mara's characterization as "blank-faced performer" remains generic. The whittling-as-metaphor-for-grief-work feels predetermined rather than discovered through specific detail.</comment>
