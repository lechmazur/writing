<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ghost's motivation to perform one final encore is clear and consistent, driving choices throughout. However, the shopkeeper appears late without established motivation beyond "weary," and the ghost's emotional progression lacks embodied contradiction—his yearning remains static rather than layering with complexity. The synesthetic perception ("voice a chorus of rusted brass and liquid violet") provides some character-specific texture but doesn't create internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the ghost discovering the coin, performing in the orchard, and achieving peace through the shopkeeper's wish—a Resonant Reconfiguration with implied cost (the ghost's dissolution). However, the shopkeeper's sudden appearance and ability to wish lacks causal grounding, and the cost remains abstract ("at peace") rather than viscerally felt. The fractured timeline concept is declared but never dramatized through concrete temporal disruption.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mystic orchard with glowing apples and the theater backstage create atmospheric specificity, particularly when "ancient apple trees bore fruit that glowed like lanterns, each branch humming a different chord." The hedge maze and synesthetic details ("colors that hummed") enhance the fantastical setting. However, the business/shopkeeper connection lacks spatial clarity, and the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain choices—the ghost simply drifts where needed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—the ghost's need for "one final encore"—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or cost. The ghost performs, the orchard responds positively, and resolution arrives through the shopkeeper's convenient wish without the ghost sacrificing anything concrete. No meaningful tightening occurs; the ghost's actions don't foreclose options or force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of hope persisting beyond endings emerges through the ghost's encore and the orchard's promise that "every closed business could bloom anew." The tarot symbols shifting from Tower to sunrise provides non-literal resonance. However, the final lines explicitly state the theme ("miracles still echo"), and the shopkeeper's role feels mechanically inserted to voice hope rather than emerging from dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with synesthetic flourishes ("liquid violet," "warm brushstroke") that suit the ghostly POV. However, the sudden shift to the shopkeeper's perspective in the final third breaks POV coherence without clear section demarcation. Phrases like "synesthetically blessed" and "resonant reconfiguration" read as authorial intrusion rather than ghost perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Persistent paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "echoes of his own lost performance, reverberations that would stitch together" restates the same concept. Template cadence appears in "The ghost felt...The ghost realized...He amplified...He began." Purple prose accumulates without precision ("luminous notes, each note a promise that possibility still lingered on the brink of despair"). The abstract language around "fractured timeline" and "aligning seconds" lacks concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The synesthetic ghost perceiving music as color offers a fresh sensory angle, and the mystic orchard hidden behind a theater provides an unexpected setting combination. However, the ghost-seeking-closure plot follows familiar templates, and the resolution through a passerby's wish feels convenient rather than earned. The fractured timeline concept is declared but never exploited for genuine temporal complexity.</comment>
