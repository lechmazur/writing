<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between eroded ambitions and resolve manifests through concrete actions (collecting story fragments, negotiating with her ghost), and her chronological confusion creates genuine disorientation. The ghost negotiation lands with earned emotional cost in tears and acceptance, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("eroded ambitions") rather than fully embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (collected story fragments) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara accepts her eroded state while finding new purpose. The closure lands with visible emotional cost (tears) and conceptual repricing (carrying stories forward despite erosion), though the ghost negotiation mechanism feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and rusted carousel create a vivid surreal landscape that constrains choices—Mara must use the camera wheel as conduit, the carousel platform as negotiation space. The lagoon's metallic ripples and kinetic churn mirror internal states effectively, with the final "luminous arcs" applauding the pact providing environmental response to character change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on Mara's need to reconcile with her abandoned path through ghost negotiation, with the camera wheel serving as mechanical conduit. The trade (stories for memory) creates genuine exchange with cost, though escalation remains primarily internal without external pressure beyond the ghost's presence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of carrying forward despite erosion emerges through concrete particulars—the carousel memory, collected story fragments, the ghost as younger self. The final image of walking toward the horizon with "fresh roots in the lagoon's depth" offers resonant non-literal answer about persistence through loss, though some thematic statements edge toward explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with distinctive perceptual signature ("throbbed with a low, humming pulse," "metallic heart"). The chronological confusion manifests in syntax and perception effectively, though occasional elevated diction ("fractured stillness," "resonant testimony") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong imagery and rhythm variation, but suffers from occasional abstract phrasing ("eroded ambitions," "fractured stillness") and some repetitive constructions around the ghost negotiation. The opening and closing images connect effectively, though middle sections contain some scaffold phrases ("she noted the fragment, storing it with a sigh").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The chronologically confused scavenger negotiating with her own ghost while collecting story fragments offers fresh synthesis of memory, time, and identity. The surreal setting (carousel above kinetic lagoon) and specific details (disposable camera wheel as conduit) create memorable particulars, though the resolution follows somewhat expected emotional beats.</comment>
