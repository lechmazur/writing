<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "teach endings how to begin" drives consistent choices through wrong-number connections, with internal complexity shown through her cultivated estrangement dissolving into communion. The transformation from isolation to connection is earned through accumulated calls, though some abstract phrasing ("teaching endings how to begin") lacks concrete embodiment in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered calls adding to the harmonica disc's loop until Mara steps out of the booth, accepting communion over estrangement—a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost of her practiced isolation. Orientation anchors clearly (tunnel, Mara, phone booth) and the pattern of wrong-number accumulation teaches its logic early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The underground tunnel setting constrains choices through isolation while the glass harmonica disc functions as both tool and repository of accumulated grief. Sensory details like "ghostly glow of old neon" and "drip of groundwater" create atmosphere, and the disc "catching flickers of streetlamps like fireflies trapped in glass" charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on transforming isolation into connection through accumulated wrong-number calls, with Lena's call providing the key deepening that shifts the pattern. The cost of Mara's cultivated estrangement becomes legible when she steps out, though escalation relies more on accumulation than active pressure points.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete accumulation of voices on the disc, transforming endings into beginnings without stating this explicitly until earned through Lena's fragments. The final image of Mara stepping out while "each ending she helped begin would someday loop back" resonates as promise rather than moral, with the loop revealed as teaching tool rather than trap.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm ("narrow subway utility tunnel stretched like a forgotten vein") and selective perception focused on sound and resonance. Brief dialogue with Lena carries subtext effectively, though some abstract constructions ("cultivated estrangement," "teaching endings how to begin") occasionally drift from embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptions linking physical and emotional states. Some abstract phrasing creates mild opacity ("teaching endings how to begin" appears without concrete grounding), and occasional elevated diction ("melodically haunted design") slightly exceeds the established register, but momentum and clarity remain strong overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass harmonica disc as repository for accumulated grief offers fresh specificity, while wrong-number friendships as deliberate practice inverts expected isolation. The synthesis of underground phone booth operator with emotional accumulation device feels non-obvious, though the concept of teaching endings to begin trends slightly abstract.</comment>
