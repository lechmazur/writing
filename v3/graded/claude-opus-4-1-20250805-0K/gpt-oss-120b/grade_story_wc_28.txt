<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gentle radical's internal journey from retrocognitively trapped memories to purposeful action shows clear motivation, though the transformation feels somewhat abstract. The moment of naming "Hearthsteel" demonstrates agency with visible cost (the fractured sky healing), but emotional embodiment remains vague with phrases like "warm coldness" that lack specific sensory grounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the plaza transforms from shattered remnant to pilgrimage site, with clear cost in the "aberrant mercy" that doesn't flood but cools grief. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through repeated mosaic imagery and the "warm coldness" paradox that reweights at the ending, though orientation anchors (who the radical is, why he's there) remain slightly vague.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ancient plaza with its mosaic stepping stone constrains the radical's choice—he must kneel and trace patterns to unlock the renaming. Sensory detail is selective (ash taste, soot-gray stones, amber light through dust) and the minaret tessera's pulsing light that "stitched the broken sky" directly shapes the closure, though some descriptions lean abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—forging "aberrant mercy" that can survive cold logic—escalates from personal mission to collective transformation as crowds gather and the plaza becomes a pilgrimage site. The cost is legible in the "warm coldness" that doesn't heal but transforms grief, though agency feels somewhat passive after the initial renaming act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the paradox of "arms of steel" cradling empathy—mercy must be engineered, not simply felt. The final image of children's laughter as "tender rebellion" and strangers bringing chipped stones hoping to "rename their sorrow into strength" offers a non-literal answer about compassion requiring structure to survive catastrophe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with purposeful compression ("retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant mercy") that serves the mythic tone. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("living diagram of hope," "golden filament") that distances from embodied perception, and the POV lacks distinct perceptual signature beyond poetic observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("minaret mosaic tessera glimmered...like a wounded beacon") but suffers from abstract loops—"warm coldness" appears five times without deepening specificity. Several passages restate similar content ("mercy forged in steel" concept repeats across multiple paragraphs) and elevated diction occasionally obscures concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of "aberrant mercy"—compassion that must be engineered rather than naturally felt after catastrophe—offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of "Hearthsteel" (warmth + steel) as a new foundation for rebuilding transforms post-apocalyptic tropes, though execution sometimes retreats into abstraction rather than maintaining specificity.</comment>
