I'll evaluate this story systematically according to the rigorous standards provided.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Auris's motivation to create music in silence is clear and embodied through physical action with the sculpture and porcelain. The character demonstrates consistent drive but lacks internal contradiction or compelling complexity beyond the single artistic obsession. The final choice to continue strumming shows persistence but doesn't foreclose alternatives with visible personal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the grove's transformation from silence to resonant archive. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through crack-reading and strumming patterns. Cost is present but somewhat abstract—the grove "breathes" differently, but Auris pays no personal price. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove functions as more than backdrop—its leaves, roots, and acoustic properties directly enable Auris's work. Sensory detail balances sound and texture effectively ("whispered like distant flutes," "mossy stone"). The porcelain insulator's material properties (glaze, resonance, fragility) constrain and enable key choices. Setting evolution from "intensely quiet" to "living archive" tracks causally with the protagonist's actions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—creating music in silence—remains consistent but escalation is limited to accumulation rather than meaningful opposition. The story deepens through discovery (stress cracks as score) but lacks a tightening that forecloses options. The hedgehog's dance and owls' emergence provide textural payoff without raising cost or forcing trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of empathy as tangible force emerges through concrete action—translating wood's pain into melody. The porcelain as "bridge" between materials creates resonance without heavy-handed symbolism. However, the phrase "empathy in motion" appears too explicitly five times, approaching thematic echo territory. The final image of the grove as "living archive" offers a non-literal answer to whether feeling can be made audible.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lyrical voice maintains consistency with musical metaphors and sensory focus appropriate to a sound artist. However, repetitive constructions appear ("He believed," "He kept strumming," "He had set out") creating template cadence. The phrase "empathy in motion" recurs mechanically. Perceptual signature exists but could be more distinctive—any artist might notice these details.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Significant repetition issues: "empathy in motion" (5x), "symphonically minded" (3x), "after the hedgehog uncurls" (3x), "intensely quiet" (3x), "porcelain insulator" (6x without variation). Template cadence runs appear in multiple paragraphs starting with "He" or "The." Mixed metaphors occasionally muddle (porcelain both "canvas" and "bridge"). These artifacts don't obscure closure but significantly impact flow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The concept of reading stress cracks as musical score offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of sculpture, sound, and empathy creates an organic whole rather than forced combination. However, the "artist communes with nature" frame is familiar, and the resolution—grove awakening to sound—follows expected patterns without surprising transformation.</comment>
