<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's internal contradiction between scientific precision and mystical belief drives authentic tension throughout, with embodied details like "each breath anchor her intention." Her final choice to repair the coin carries visible cost through the "luminous regret" transformation. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "fragmented self-knowledge" that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the repaired coin represents both external achievement and internal redemption, with cost legible in the "luminous regret" shifting to "quiet gratitude." The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and symbolic weight build toward the final transformation. Orientation anchors (alchemist, foundry, after search party) establish cleanly. Deduction for the search party element remaining vague—its dispersal matters but lacks concrete stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The foundry setting actively constrains and enables the alchemist's work through specific tools (anvil, furnaces) and atmospheric pressure (rain, metallic scent). Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional focus on temperature, metal states, and precise measurements. The environment charges the final image through the rain's shift from "hammered" to "whisper." Minor deduction for some generic descriptors like "hot iron and old soot."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the weight of names through repairing the coin—escalates from measurement to action to transformation. The crack widening "just enough" shows genuine risk, and the gold sealing creates irreversible change. However, the external pressure from the search party's departure lacks concrete consequence, keeping this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the kintsugi metaphor—broken things gaining value through repair—without explicit moralizing. The "weight of names" concept develops from childhood memory through present action to final understanding. The ending reweights earlier material as "luminous regret" transforms to "quiet gratitude" through earned experience. Slight deduction for one instance of abstract philosophizing about "continuous negotiation with limits."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through the alchemist's technical focus on measurements, temperatures, and metallurgical states. Voice modulates effectively from contemplative opening to intense focus during the repair to reflective conclusion. Some elevated diction ("factually mystical," "redemption of both the coin's broken story") occasionally strains against the otherwise grounded voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in sensory descriptions that advance both atmosphere and character state. Clear propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks. Deductions for several abstract phrases ("invisible mass," "fragmented self-knowledge") and minor repetition around "weight" and "names" that borders on thematic echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The kintsugi repair concept offers a fresh angle on redemption narratives, with specific alchemical details grounding the mystical elements. The synthesis of scientific precision with spiritual belief creates memorable texture. The "weight of names" exploration adds philosophical depth without abstraction. Modest deduction for the search party element feeling somewhat generic despite its structural importance.</comment>
