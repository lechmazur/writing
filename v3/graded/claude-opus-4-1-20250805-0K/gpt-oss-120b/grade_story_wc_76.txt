<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's singular drive to master the lighthouse mechanism is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like the hunger stone warming against his palm. However, motivation lacks deeper contradiction or cost—he achieves his goal without meaningful struggle or sacrifice, and the "bleak exhilaration" remains more told than dramatized through competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain (arrival → discovery → decoding → activation) with a legible Decisive Change when the lighthouse blazes to life. However, the closure lacks visible cost—the clock maker simply succeeds and vanishes, with no price paid or path foreclosed. The orientation is solid but the "stepping beyond fate" remains abstract without concrete stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric details like "cliffs rose like jagged teeth" and the tactile lighthouse mechanics create vivid setting. The yoyo's mechanical properties and the hunger stone's radiance effectively constrain the solution path. However, the rocky island setting itself doesn't pressure choices—it's more backdrop than active participant in the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (unlocking the perpetual engine) is signaled early and pursued consistently, but escalation is minimal—the clock maker faces no meaningful obstacles or reversals. The yoyo puzzle provides mild complication but resolves smoothly without forcing trade-offs. No visible cost or foreclosed option emerges from his success.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of reversing fate through ingenuity emerges from the counter-clockwise motif and mechanical mastery, with the yoyo-as-cipher adding conceptual depth. However, the ending states rather than dramatizes the theme ("forging a future unbound by time"), and the sailor's observation feels tacked on rather than resonant. The hunger stone's "latent radiance" works better as recurring image than thematic driver.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistent POV with some distinctive touches like "the ocean seemed to inhale and release its breath" and technical precision around the mechanical elements. However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("bleak exhilaration that pulsed through his veins") and the prose lacks the rhythmic control that would heighten tension during the decoding sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Significant repetition issues plague the text: "bleak exhilaration" appears three times, "latent radiance" five times, "hunger stone" becomes a loop. Template cadence emerges in "He [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Some strong images like the yoyo encoding and gear teeth grinding partially offset these artifacts, but the prose needs substantial tightening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The counter-clockwise clock maker concept and yoyo-as-cipher mechanism show genuine originality, transforming a toy into an ancient encoding device. The perpetual engine lighthouse adds fresh inflection to the lighthouse keeper trope. However, the "stepping beyond fate" resolution follows predictable triumph without subversion or meaningful complication.</comment>
