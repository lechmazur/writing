I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This operates as an Accumulative/Textural piece, building meaning through layered discoveries and symbolic resonance rather than strict causality. The cylinder's riddles, the prism's colors, and the waxed leaf accumulate toward a conceptual repricing about connection across distance.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rook's transformation from body-finder to memory-keeper shows clear motivation with embodied detail ("muzzle dusted with ash," "heart thumped"). The internal shift at closure is earned through concrete discovery, though some interiority borders on over-articulation ("stitching the broken world with threads of remembered scent").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing as Rook's purpose transforms from finding bodies to keeping connections, with felt cost in carrying others' voices. The accumulative structure coheres through the cylinder-prism-leaf progression, though the final paragraph's "wild hush" repetition weakens impact slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains and enables choices effectively—the prism refracts moonlight to decode the cylinder, the collapsed kiosk conceals the chest. Sensory specificity ("metallic dust that sang under his weight") and the post-war wasteland atmosphere directly shape Rook's quest and discoveries.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity about the cylinder to recovering the mythic leaf to accepting the burden of carrying voices. The progression tightens through riddle-solving and physical searching, though agency feels somewhat passive as Rook follows instructions rather than making difficult choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "distance into closeness"—the leaf literally bridges separation between souls. The copper veins, violet/emerald light, and amber preservation create resonant imagery, though "wild hush" feels forced as a refrain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency through dog-specific perception ("ears pruning the hush") and post-apocalyptic register. Some passages drift toward elevated diction ("mute testimony," "palpable closeness") that slightly exceeds Rook's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("horizon glowed with smoldered amber") but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in the final third ("Rook felt... Rook settled... Rook knew").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The bloodhound-as-memory-guardian and the phonograph cylinder decoded by light refraction offer fresh angles. The post-war scrapyard setting avoids generic wasteland tropes through specific details, though the mythic leaf device feels somewhat familiar.</comment>
