I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The map framer's "methodically curious" trait drives concrete actions throughout—comparing footage, tracing fissures, interpreting silence—with embodied tension ("trembling arm"). Her conviction about reading silence "with empathy" manifests in specific choices rather than mere declaration. Loses points for some abstract emotional labeling ("shielded openness") and the final paragraph's drift toward thematic summary rather than embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery (rain/stone/map/footage). The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when "the whispered chapel now alive with a muted chorus" creates Charged Poise—options crystallized but cost implied rather than paid on-page. Strong causality through video alignment revealing glyphs, though the exact transformation mechanism ("energy to seep") remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rich sensory layering ("rain-scoured," "smelled of wet plaster") with setting actively constraining choices—the vault's frescoed walls, the sealed chapel, the ancient henge all shape her investigation method. The torn map functions as micro-setting that directly enables the discovery. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as she repositions equipment to align footage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes emerge through accumulation: the "whispered chapel hidden beneath" needs reopening, building through video comparison to glyph discovery. The protagonist's agency drives escalation via deliberate choices (pausing reels, overlapping images, repositioning projector). Cost remains primarily conceptual—"centuries of loss"—rather than viscerally felt, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of reading "silence like a language" and bridging temporal divides. The map tear as "portal" rather than flaw offers genuine thematic resonance without explicit moralizing. Final image of "dialogue across generations" reweights all prior material, though it edges toward abstraction in the last lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("rain-scoured fresco vault," "stone echo"). POV remains stable with appropriate focalization. However, register occasionally elevates beyond the character's established lexicon ("pallid white drizzle," "stoic presence"), and some constructions feel writerly rather than organic to the focalizer's mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("bruised purple sky"), some abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy ("shielded openness"), and the final paragraph's drift into conceptual summary rather than concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography and temporal archaeology creates an original premise. The specific detail of comparing footage across decades to read stone shadows demonstrates genuine ingenuity. The concept of map tears as deliberate portals transforms expected material, though execution occasionally relies on familiar mystical imagery.</comment>
