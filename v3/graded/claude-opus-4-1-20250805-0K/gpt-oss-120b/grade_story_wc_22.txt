<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation to heal through ancient knowledge is clear, but interiority remains abstract ("felt the weight of ancestors lift") rather than embodied. The character's actions align with purpose, yet internal conflict never manifests as contradictory impulses in scene—he proceeds without genuine struggle or cost to his choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds through layered imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the battlefield transforms to garden. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—the coachman sacrifices nothing tangible, and the "narrow vastness" resolution lacks the visible price that would elevate closure beyond thematic assertion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The jetty setting with orchids and phosphorescent algae creates atmosphere, but doesn't constrain choices or enable specific tactics. Sensory details favor the visual ("bruised violet," "bleached bones") while other senses remain underdeveloped, missing opportunities for the coachman's selective perception to reveal character.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—healing war's damage through ancient knowledge—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or complication. The seeds simply work when scattered; no tightening occurs as the coachman encounters no obstacles, reversals, or trade-offs that would force a harder choice or reveal cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The battlefield-to-garden transformation emerges through concrete imagery, avoiding direct moralizing. However, the theme of renewal remains surface-level without complexity—the piece presents healing as purely positive without exploring what might be lost in transformation or why the reef's death enables this particular rebirth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The lyrical voice maintains consistency but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—the coachman notices what any observer might see. Repetitive phrasing ("narrow vastness" appears four times) and template constructions ("He whispered," "He scattered," "He watched") flatten rhythm without pattern-teaching that would justify the repetition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades ("The coachman..." starts multiple sentences; "He [verb]" pattern repeats). Abstract phrasing like "narrow vastness" and "submerged concord" obscures concrete meaning, while paraphrase loops ("garden reclaiming the scarred ground" / "garden's reclamation") dilute momentum without adding pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The concept of using bird-translated dead languages to heal battlefields offers originality, but execution relies on familiar tropes (mystical gardener, war-scarred landscape). The "narrow vastness" paradox attempts philosophical depth but remains abstract rather than grounded in specific, lived detail that would transform the premise.</comment>
