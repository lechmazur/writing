I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases and patterns build toward a resonant reconfiguration through the garden's transformation and the traveler's understanding.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation to map "the geography of healing" through writing obituaries for the living is consistent and deepens through concrete actions. His micro-choices—kneeling in leaves, tracing marble, placing the thread beside the rose—reveal values under pressure. However, internal contradiction remains more stated than embodied ("lonesome splendor softening into quiet hope"), and the transformation lacks sufficient dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when "the garden's shadows receded" and the traveler finds "quiet hope," but the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral. The accumulative structure builds through whispered stories and projected narratives, yet the closure's "promise that the geography of healing would always have a guide" feels asserted rather than earned through dramatized pressure. Who/where/when anchors are present but impressionistic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shadowed garden setting actively shapes the traveler's actions—"each withered blossom was an absence he could explain through his ink." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("damp amber," "texture crisp beneath his fingers"). The garden's transformation from shadow to "soft gold" mirrors the internal journey, and the palace carpet thread constrains his method of projection throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping healing through recording absences—is signaled early but lacks meaningful tightening. The rose's revival represents a deepening moment, yet no genuine opposition tests the traveler's commitment. The "gentle tide of understanding" arrives without sufficient resistance, and while the ending suggests ongoing work ("each corridor required a new thread"), the cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of healing through acknowledgment of absence emerges organically from the traveler's actions of writing "obituaries for the living." The final image of following "the map his own words had drawn" offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, phrases like "geography of healing" and "lonesome splendor" edge toward explicit thematic statement rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistency with purposeful compression ("sailing the world's fringes, recording obituaries for the living"). POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature focuses on absence and texture. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("vivid description of love left hanging like ripe grapes"), and some constructions feel writerly rather than organic to the focalizer's experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades peak moments—"love left hanging like ripe grapes on a vine too soon stripped" mixes vehicles awkwardly. Template cadence appears in "He knelt...He wrote...He sensed...He lifted...He placed." The phrase "geography of healing" repeats five times without variation. While individual sentences achieve moments of beauty, density often obscures rather than clarifies, particularly in the extended metaphorical passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of writing "obituaries for the living" offers a fresh angle on grief and healing. The synthesis of cartography and mourning ("latitude of grief and the longitude of hope") creates memorable specificity. The traveler's method of using a palace carpet thread to project presence shows inventive world-building, though execution occasionally relies on abstract philosophizing rather than concrete dramatization.</comment>
