Looking at this story through an Accumulative/Textural lens, where density builds toward the transformation from fear-paralyzed stunt double to someone who embraces vulnerability as power.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between performed bravery and genuine terror drives authentic choices, particularly when she must decode the shell's cipher using stunt moves. The transformation from "trembling certainty" to "firmly adaptive rhythm" feels earned through concrete actions rather than epiphany, though some passages drift toward therapy-speak ("vulnerability is power").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as Mara accepts that "my greatest stunt was simply surviving my own terror." The accumulative structure builds through library exploration → shell discovery → cipher decoding → amber transformation, each layer deepening her relationship with fear. However, the magical elements (amber vial, leviathan fragment) introduce late rules that strain causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rusted library functions as more than backdrop—its "cracked dome letting in constellations" and shifting shelves create genuine spatial pressure. The seashell-to-vial-to-transformation sequence uses objects to constrain choices effectively. The library's final luminescence charges the ending image of Mara "hovering on the edge of the universe."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal revelation ("not the fearless hero") through physical danger (collapsing aisle mechanism) to existential choice (accepting vulnerability). The cost is visible when she must betray "the self I had hidden for years." The magical resolution weakens earned pressure but doesn't negate the accumulative build.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of transforming vulnerability into power emerges through concrete actions—using fear-based stunt knowledge to decode life-threatening puzzles. The final image of the fearless walker "forever changed" resonates without moralizing, though phrases like "vulnerability is power" edge toward thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains poetic consistency with controlled compression ("half-whispering seashell," "trembling certainty"). The perceptual signature stays distinct—a performer reading the world through stunt choreography. Some passages lean purple ("constellations that seemed to chart a map of forgotten stories") but rhythm supports the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose density serves the lyric mode but occasionally tips into overwriting—"the library's cracked dome let in constellations that seemed to chart a map of forgotten stories" could shed modifiers. Template phrasing appears ("I sensed," "I realized," "I felt") and some metaphors strain (library bones "groaning" then "sighing"). The transformation sequence maintains clarity despite ornate language.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of a phobic stunt double discovering courage through vulnerability offers fresh contradiction. Using stunt choreography to decode survival instructions shows ingenuity. The magical elements feel somewhat generic (amber vials, mythic leviathans) but the synthesis of physical performance and emotional truth creates originality.</comment>
