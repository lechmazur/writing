I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This story operates under a **Causal lens** - Lia's discovery follows clear because/therefore linkages as she traces metadata, tests hypotheses, and unlocks hidden files through the discovered checksum pattern.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lia's motivation to find deleted files evolves from abstract curiosity to purposeful mission with clear internal logic. The transformation feels earned through concrete discoveries, though her emotional interior remains somewhat thin during peak moments. Her final choice to propagate the lie shows agency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from archive entry through metadata discovery to final revelation, with the recurring numbers serving as persistent constraint. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lia transforms absence into presence, with clear cost in perpetuating deception. Minor orientation wobble around "vaulted archives" physical/digital duality early on.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The digital archive setting actively constrains Lia's search methods and provides specific tools (metadata, checksums, hidden servers). Sensory detail like "amber light" and "static-thick air" creates atmosphere while the obsolete emoji wall and rusted terminal rack ground the digital in physical space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity through discovery to moral choice about perpetuating lies. The dominant stake (finding the lost crew) tightens when Lia realizes the numbers are a deliberate message, forcing her decision to spread fabricated content with clear trade-off between truth and rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of memory persistence versus deletion emerges organically through the archive's hidden layers and resurrection of "deleted" files. The final message "stored in the silence you felt as absence" reweights the entire search without explicit moralizing, though some passages edge toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical register appropriate to Lia's role, with controlled shifts during discovery moments. Some filter-heavy passages ("She realized," "She felt") dull immediacy in middle beats. The prose rhythm accelerates appropriately during the server farm discovery sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful technical vocabulary, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("The code matched the three numbers she had seen, confirming that the crew had hidden their coordinates"). Mixed metaphor of "phantom breadcrumbs" slightly muddles the digital/physical boundary. Information density varies, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others merely restate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of social media archaeology with space exploration creates non-obvious angle on digital persistence. The concept of crew members embedding themselves in metadata to survive deletion shows genuine ingenuity. The hoodie patch as physical-digital bridge and obsolete emojis as architectural elements demonstrate specific imagination.</comment>
