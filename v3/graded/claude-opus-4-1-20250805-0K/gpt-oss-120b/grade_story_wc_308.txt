I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through layered imagery and pattern recognition, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where the protagonist achieves understanding without physical movement.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "navigate without moving" drives consistent choices through appraising the arrowhead and reading bird patterns. Internal progression from observation to understanding feels earned, though the character remains somewhat archetypal rather than individually textured. The final renunciation of physical movement for mental navigation shows clear cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative structure coheres well as patterns layer (pulse→arrowhead→birds→internal map) toward the Earned Stasis closure where she achieves navigation through understanding rather than movement. The cost is legible in "weathered resolve" and the choice to "slip into silence." Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The canyon setting actively constrains choices—she must learn to navigate its echoes rather than leave physically. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("pressure wave that brushed against her skin"), with the towers of bone and stone platform creating spatial coherence. The environment directly enables the final transformation through echo pathways.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from discovering the arrowhead to achieving non-physical navigation, with the birds' arrival creating the decisive pressure point. The protagonist's agency drives the escalation through active appraisal and pattern-reading. Cost appears in accepting stillness over motion, though the middle could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete tension between movement and stillness, with the final image of "slipping into silence" offering a non-literal answer about alternative forms of progress. The pulse motif accumulates meaning without becoming heavy-handed. Subtext operates well through the canyon-as-teacher metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains mystical-contemplative register consistently with phrases like "harmonic stone skimmer" and "weathered resolve." POV remains stable in limited third. Some register elevation ("historically reverent," "appraise") fits the mythic tone though occasionally approaches purple territory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves lyrical density with purposeful repetition of "pulse" and "echo" that serves the accumulative structure. Some phrases edge toward overwriting ("skeletal spires rose like ancient ribs") but information density remains high. The "weathered resolve" repetition works as pattern-teaching rather than redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of navigation through stillness and pattern-reading offers a fresh angle on the journey narrative. The synthesis of sound, vibration, and bird flight into an "invisible lattice" feels specific to this world. Execution is competent though not groundbreaking.</comment>
