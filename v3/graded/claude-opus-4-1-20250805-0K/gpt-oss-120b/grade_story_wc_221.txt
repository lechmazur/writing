<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to navigate by "invisible true north" and transform pariah status into pilgrimage is clear, but the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—mostly reflective summary rather than simultaneous opposing impulses in scene. The final choice to continue charting possibilities has visible commitment but limited dramatized cost beyond abstract "loss and hope."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds through layered imagery (compass, sketching ritual, temporal dilation) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist commits to mapping possibilities. However, the cost remains largely conceptual—"blessed pariah" status and family loss are declared but not dramatized with felt consequence. The orientation anchors (post-shutdown city, observation deck) arrive clearly by ~60 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck effectively functions as micro-setting, its temporal properties enabling the glimpse of the pre-shutdown world and constraining the protagonist's navigation attempts. Sensory details like "violet and ash" sky and the compass's warmth are selective and purposeful, though the shutdown city remains somewhat abstract beyond "hollow towers."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding direction in a fractured reality—is signaled early and deepens when the temporal glimpse reveals ancestral connection. However, escalation remains primarily internal without concrete opposition or trade-offs; the protagonist faces no resistance to continuing the sketching ritual or navigating the deck's temporal field.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of navigation through loss emerges organically through the compass imagery and sketching ritual, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of "the universe waited with patient arms" resonates with the established motifs, though the transformation from "confusion into exploration" feels somewhat predetermined rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistent elevated register with controlled rhythm, particularly in phrases like "minutes stretched like taffy." However, some constructions feel overwrought ("blessed pariah stepped onto the time dilation observation deck") and the perceptual signature lacks distinctive character-specific bias beyond poetic observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff ("river of light," "glass cradle," "temporal field"). Template cadence emerges in the parallel "I [verb]" constructions across multiple sentences. The phrase "blessed pariah" repeats four times without evolving meaning, creating unnecessary loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The concept of navigating by "invisible true north" in a post-apocalyptic temporal anomaly offers fresh angle on familiar loss/hope territory. The synthesis of family ritual with quantum echo creates specificity, though execution relies heavily on abstract declaration rather than dramatized discovery.</comment>
