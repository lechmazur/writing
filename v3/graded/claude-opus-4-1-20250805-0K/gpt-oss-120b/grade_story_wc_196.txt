<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Amelia's motivation is clear and her "tactfully hopeful" trait drives consistent action, but internal contradiction remains largely abstract ("broken heart stitching itself back together"). The final choice to continue archiving lacks visible cost—no alternative is foreclosed. Emotional progression relies on telling ("felt a quiet thrill") rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with dust patterns revealing histories, but closure lacks decisive change or reconfiguration—Amelia simply continues her work without visible cost or foreclosed alternatives. The button's discovery initiates accumulation but the ending offers repetition rather than transformation. No clear before/after shift is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The file room setting provides atmosphere and the button/dust mechanism creates a unique discovery system. Sensory detail focuses heavily on visual (dust patterns, silhouettes) while other senses remain absent. The room constrains discovery to what dust reveals, though spatial choreography becomes vague when silhouettes project "onto the file walls."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract—"magnifying small kindnesses" and "honoring histories" never face concrete opposition or require trade-offs. The supervisor's immediate agreement removes potential conflict without cost. No meaningful tightening occurs; the ending simply extends the pattern established at the beginning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme of forgotten histories finding voice emerges through the dust/button discovery system, though execution tends toward explicit statement ("quiet testament to histories that refuse to die"). The recurring button and dust patterns create coherent imagery. However, thematic resolution relies on assertion rather than dramatized revelation, particularly in direct statements about "magnifying small kindnesses."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent melancholic tone with controlled diction ("choreography," "unfurling") though syntax becomes monotonous with repeated participial phrases. POV remains stable but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Amelia notices everything with equal poeticism. Filter-heavy construction ("She felt," "She imagined," "She realized") dulls immediacy throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Prose suffers from extensive paraphrase loops—"histories that refuse to die" echoes "stories that refuse to be forgotten" conceptually. Template cadence pervades ("She lifted...She set...She traced...She wrote"). Metaphorical density overwhelms clarity with dust simultaneously being "choreography," "filaments," "patterns," and "testament." The phrase "magnifying small kindnesses" repeats verbatim three times.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dust-as-archive concept offers a fresh angle on discovering forgotten histories, and the button's light projection mechanism is inventive. However, execution relies on familiar tropes of the sensitive archivist finding meaning in forgotten documents. The transformation of dust into readable history strains credibility without establishing magical realism rules.</comment>
