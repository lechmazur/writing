<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The courier's motivation to spread wonder is consistent and embodied through specific actions with the pendant, though internal contradiction could be stronger. The shepherd and girl encounters show genuine transformation with visible cost (years of dullness, cracked tablet's mystery). Character-particular interiority emerges in "each step measured against the hum" and the remembered mentor lessons, though some passages drift toward generic ("sudden spark of wonder").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the story builds through episodic encounters that deepen the pendant's power and legacy. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the ridgeway becoming a pilgrimage site where "wonder can be coaxed from even the most routine of paths." Cost is felt through the courier's jittery urgency and the absent mentor's lingering influence, though the final transformation could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway functions as more than backdrop—it "whispers his name" and creates "a natural cathedral where memory faded into legend." Sensory details like "ribbons of dancing light" and "liquid glass" pools are vivid and purposeful. The pendant's vibration creates micro-setting that constrains choices, though some descriptions lean generic ("tunnel of shifting greens and violets").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake of spreading wonder escalates through three encounters (shepherd, girl, implied merchants), each deepening the pendant's power from individual transformation to generational legend. The courier's agency drives each interaction, though pressure could tighten more dramatically. Cost appears in the "fade from memory to legend" and the pendant's dimming glow after each use.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pendant's ability to "germinate" wonder in routine lives, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of pilgrims seeking sympathetic vibration with their hopes offers resonant answer to how brief encounters become lasting myth. Subtext operates through the absent mentor's teachings and the pendant's selective response to different people.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "jittery" matching the courier's nervous energy, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("natural cathedral," "mythic wonder"). Perceptual signature shows in how the courier reads the pendant's vibrations and maps "unseen currents." Some repetitive phrasing ("germinate" appears 6 times) creates template cadence that dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("dragonfly-wing pendant that shimmered like a captured sunrise") but suffers from repetitive stems and overuse of "germinate." Template cadence appears in parallel structures ("He believed...," "He remembered...," "He felt..."). Information density varies, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others loop concepts like "brief encounters" without advancement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The pendant as conduit for extending ephemeral moments into lasting impressions offers fresh angle on the mentor-student transmission story. Specific details like the "dragonfly-wing" design and sympathetic vibration mechanism avoid generic magic. The transformation from individual courier to pilgrimage tradition shows organic development, though some elements feel template-driven.</comment>
