<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to learn "the language of old buildings" drives consistent choices throughout, with internal tension between scholarly pretense and deeper mystical pursuit. The final realization that the quest is "to hear the heartbeats of forgotten walls and translate them into living dialogue" represents earned understanding through experience. However, Liora remains more archetype than individual—her "patiently nimble grace" and ability to "read the ghosts of stone" lack contradictory impulses or vulnerability that would elevate characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmospheric density through meteor shower, stone language, and agreed-upon lies toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator becomes "newly fluent" in stone's grammar. The closure lands with conceptual cost—accepting lies as "stepping stones toward truth"—and the final image of learning "to listen to the creak of a window latch as if it were a word" reweights the entire mystical framework. Minor deduction for the slightly rushed transition from single meeting to established weekly ritual without showing the intermediate acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during meteor shower creates genuine atmospheric pressure—"each streak a fleeting hymn"—while the building itself becomes quasi-animate through "brick's silent grammar" and walls that "taught her their stories." The borrowed sugar detail grounds the mystical in mundane specificity. The setting actively constrains choices (needing to borrow sugar) and charges the final image where "the building itself could speak to us without secrecy."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to commune with buildings through "agreed upon lies"—remains consistent but lacks meaningful tightening beyond the sugar-borrowing solution that establishes weekly meetings. The story presents accumulation rather than escalation: meteor shower intensifies, understanding deepens, but no genuine reversal or narrowing of options occurs. The cost remains primarily conceptual (accepting deception as path to truth) without visceral pressure that would elevate the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "agreed upon lies" as "stepping stones toward truth," with the antique seal's sigil representing "a protective charm for those who dare to converse with stone." The final image of learning to hear "a window latch as if it were a word" offers resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral. However, some thematic articulation feels overly explicit, particularly "to learn the language of old buildings not merely to decode inscriptions, but to hear the heartbeats of forgotten walls."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature throughout—"falling fire," "ghosts of stone," "cosmic display"—with consistent mystical-scholarly register. The narrator's selective attention to architectural animacy ("fingertips brushing the rusted iron rail as though testing each vibration") reflects unique consciousness. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that strains POV credibility ("mysterious familiarity," "conspiratorial") and dialogue absence that prevents full voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose maintains atmospheric density with vivid imagery—"meteor shower painted silver streaks," "garden pulse with an ancient rhythm"—but suffers from repetitive phrasing around stone/building language that creates mild loops. Several sentences could be cut without loss ("The meteor shower intensified, each streak a fleeting hymn" adds atmosphere but not pressure). Information density is moderate; most sentences do single rather than multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise of learning to communicate with buildings through "agreed upon lies" and mystical tutelage offers genuine freshness, particularly the paradox that deception enables truth. The borrowed sugar detail and weekly tea ritual ground the fantastical in domestic specificity. However, the mystical mentor archetype (Liora) and the scholarly-quest frame are familiar territory not fully transformed.</comment>
