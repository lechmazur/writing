<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to "discover the texture of time" drives consistent choices, but internal contradiction remains abstract rather than embodied in scene. The final choice to bind the rope shows agency with some cost, though the "ethically playful" trait reads more as authorial assertion than character-specific behavior. The transformation from wanderer to chronicler tracks causally but lacks the visceral embodiment needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens applies: the piece builds density through layered imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where binding the rope crystallizes the poet's stance. Cost appears in "sealing the echo of the escaped soul" though it remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The orientation anchors (grotto, poet, energy beings) establish by ~100 words, and the pattern-weaving accumulates toward closure, but the cost lacks the concrete weight needed for 7+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto functions as more than backdrop—its walls, tunnels, and mineral glazes constrain the poet's choices and enable his pattern-tracing. Sensory detail like "faint electric scent" and "amber veins" creates atmosphere while the rope's interaction with "jagged stone" provides tactile grounding. The setting directly shapes the final choice to bind the rope to stone, meeting the constraint requirement for higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through pattern accumulation and "impossible choices" that multiply as the poet descends. The stakes around preserving versus releasing memory deepen appropriately, but the choices feel more philosophical than urgent—lacking the visceral cost that would push this higher. The final fork presents genuine tension though the resolution's "playful ethic" deflates some earned pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the weaving metaphor—time as rope, memory as thread, patterns that bind past to future. The final image of the rope's luminescence expanding "like ripples that mapped his inner journey" offers resonance without stating a moral. However, phrases like "the most profound discoveries are made by those who dare to untangle" edge toward explicit thematic statement, preventing entry to higher bands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistency with purposeful compression and elevated diction suited to the poet-protagonist. However, register drift appears in phrases like "collective longing of all wanderers" and "very marrow of the universe" that exceed the established lexicon. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—the poet observes but doesn't filter uniquely through his specific consciousness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: "terra-cotta grotto under starlight," "passionate subtlety that flavored every line," "the very marrow of the universe." Mixed metaphors clash—rope as compass rose, as memory, as time itself. Template cadence appears in "He began...By uncovering...As he followed" structure. The paraphrase loop in the final paragraph ("most profound discoveries"/"dare to untangle") confirms systematic prose debt that caps this below 5.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of energy beings leaving traces that a poet decodes through rope-weaving offers moderate freshness. The synthesis of prison escape rope with time-texture creates an unexpected connection. However, the execution relies on abstract philosophizing rather than grounded specificity, and the "wandering poet discovers meaning" frame echoes familiar templates without sufficient transformation.</comment>
