I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's "forgiving skeptic" trait manifests through concrete actions (setting vertebrae, trusting the tooth's power) but lacks genuine internal contradiction in scene. The transformation from doubt to belief happens too smoothly without embodied struggle or visible cost to her skepticism.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with dense imagery building toward Mara's healing act, but the closure lacks decisive change with visible cost. The "restoration" happens without meaningful resistance or price—the tooth simply works, and Mara succeeds without sacrifice or transformation that would create a true before/after.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The secret garden setting actively shapes the narrative through its "midnight perfume," moss-cradled body, and mystical properties that enable the healing. Sensory details like "each click of vertebrae resonated like a note" effectively filter through Mara's bone-setter perspective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract—restoring "the missing vertebrae of truth" and healing a "substitute body" whose emptiness matters only conceptually. No concrete pressure builds toward the healing moment; the tooth works without resistance, removing tension from what should be the climactic act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of redemption through transforming "mistakes into constellations" emerges through imagery and repetition but relies heavily on abstract metaphors. The final image of Mara drawing star maps connects thematically but doesn't offer a resonant answer earned through concrete struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "breathed midnight perfume" but suffers from register drift into elevated diction ("embryonic galaxy," "nostalgic innovation") that clashes with character grounding. No dialogue to evaluate, limiting voice distinction opportunities.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from density overload—nearly every sentence contains figurative language ("secret cradle," "luminous pattern," "literal cleft") without pattern or payoff. Mixed metaphors ("vertebrae of truth," "mistakes into constellations") and abstract phrasing ("nostalgic innovation") obscure rather than illuminate key moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept of healing through a changeling's tooth in a secret garden offers some originality, but execution relies on familiar magical realism tropes. The transformation of mistakes into constellations provides a fresh angle but remains too abstract to feel fully realized.</comment>
