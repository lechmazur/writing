<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Corin's motivation to capture echoes is clear and consistent, but lacks internal contradiction or embodied emotional complexity. The character remains too smoothly competent throughout—his reverse-engineering succeeds without meaningful struggle or mistake. The final realization about the cellar as library rather than prison arrives without sufficient dramatized pressure to earn it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building toward the echo-harvest, but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost. The ending merely extends the pattern ("continued his work") without reconfiguration or price paid. While the crystal-tooth replacement creates a functional turn, no path is foreclosed and no meaningful cost appears on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The marble cavern setting is vividly rendered with phosphorescent moss, reflected light beams, and acoustic properties that directly enable the echo-harvest. Setting constrains Corin's method through reflection angles and resonance. However, the environment doesn't evolve with the story's progression or charge the final image beyond decorative starlight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing wonder from echoes—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or cost. The timer repair proceeds without setback, the echo-harvest succeeds immediately, and no trade-off or foreclosed option appears. The story lacks escalation under its Accumulative lens; density doesn't meaningfully increase toward closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of preserving wonder emerges through the echo-harvest metaphor and the cellar/library distinction. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the thematic lesson ("a lesson in listening to the periphery of existence"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The concept of "reverse-engineering secrets" offers resonance but lacks complexity or counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the reflective locksmith, with controlled diction like "waning cliffs" and "lull of a wounded season." However, the narrative voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—Corin notices everything with equal articulation. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing around reflection/echo concepts and overuse of abstract descriptors ("wounded season," "cellar of reason"). The final paragraph contains multiple paraphrase loops restating the same content. Template cadence appears in "He realized... He recorded... He felt..." constructions. However, individual sentences flow smoothly and grammar remains clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The echo-harvest concept offers moderate freshness, combining locksmith craft with acoustic preservation. However, the story follows a predictable template of craftsman-discovers-secret-and-succeeds without transformation or risk. The "cellar of reason" metaphor feels forced rather than organic, and the piece lacks specific lived detail that would elevate familiar material.</comment>
