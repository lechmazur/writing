<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Harel's motivation to archive emotional patterns is clear and drives his investigation of the prophecy, but his internal experience lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. The field trip memory functions but feels convenient rather than earned through struggle. Character remains somewhat abstract despite specific actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds toward Harel's final recording that transforms prophecy into promise. The closure lands with conceptual cost (the loop of preservation feeding future destruction) but the weight feels more asserted than dramatized. Orientation anchors arrive clearly within opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sky-bound orchard with its anachronistic elements (pomegranates, steel, phonograph) creates a distinctive atmosphere that constrains Harel's actions. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, particularly the fruit's trembling and the orchard's "exhale." The setting actively participates in the prophecy's revelation through the phonograph.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving versus preventing the prophesied destruction—emerges but lacks escalating pressure after the prophecy's discovery. Harel's response feels contemplative rather than pressured; no meaningful tightening forces a harder choice. The resolution arrives through understanding rather than tested commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of cyclical preservation emerges organically through the prophecy-as-map concept and the loop of archivists teaching future archivists. The final image of the orchard as "living archive" resonates without moralizing. The piece earns its meditation on memory and inevitability through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the mythic tone, with controlled rhythm throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct—Harel notices through linguistic and archival frames. No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice stays coherent even under the prophecy's weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs, though some figurative language feels overstacked ("velvet disquiet," "brass now a memory"). Information unfolds cleanly despite complex syntax. Some paraphrase loops appear ("archive emotional patterns" concept restated), and register occasionally drifts purple in peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of ancient prophecy with urban verticality and archival technology offers a fresh angle. The wax cylinder as oracle and the concept of emotional patterns as historical record show genuine originality. The piece commits to its premise without retreat, though some elements feel assembled rather than inevitable.</comment>
