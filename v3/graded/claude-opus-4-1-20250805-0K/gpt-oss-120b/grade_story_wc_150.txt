I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Inferred Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and repetition toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara completes the altar and restores faith.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to restore faith is clear but relies heavily on abstract description rather than embodied emotion. The character operates more as a vehicle for atmospheric accumulation than a complex individual with contradictory impulses. Her "warmly curious" trait manifests only as label, not through specific choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the altar's completion allows ancestors to speak, fulfilling Mara's mission. However, the accumulative structure lacks sufficient density increase or pattern break to fully justify the textural lens. The cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard setting excels with vivid sensory detail - roots "humming with low resonance," bones producing "cadence," bioluminescent guidance. The environment actively participates in the narrative through responsive roots and skeletal architecture that shapes Mara's journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract throughout - "restore lost faith" never faces concrete opposition or meaningful complication. The story lacks escalation under the accumulative lens; density doesn't meaningfully increase, and no pattern break forces difficult choices. Resolution arrives through methodical completion rather than earned pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the integration of diaspora return, ancestral connection, and faith restoration. The sundial marking "the hour when the dead could speak to the living" provides resonant specificity. However, the final paragraph veers toward explicit moralizing about "patient rebuilding and hopeful wandering."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent lyrical distance but lacks a distinct perceptual signature. Phrases like "cautious enchantment," "warmly curious," and "purposeful wandering" feel templated rather than voice-driven. No dialogue prevents character voice distinction, and the narrative register remains uniformly elevated without modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Severe repetition issues pervade: "diaspora returnee" appears 4 times, "purposeful wandering" 3 times, "interrupted journeys" 3 times, creating mechanical echo rather than purposeful accumulation. Template cadence runs ("She walked...She remembered...She felt...") and abstract descriptors ("cautious enchantment," "quiet gratitude") replace concrete specificity. The final third particularly suffers from paraphrase loops about faith restoration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The concept of a catacomb orchard where roots intertwine with bones offers originality, as does the sundial altar marking communication between living and dead. However, execution relies on familiar spiritual journey templates without sufficient transformation through lived detail or specific worldbuilding.</comment>
