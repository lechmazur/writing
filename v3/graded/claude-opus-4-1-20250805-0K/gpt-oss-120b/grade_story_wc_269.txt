<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Characters have clear motivation (monitoring/documenting reef loss) and Mara's "periodically eternal" memory creates genuine internal texture, but the discovery sequence lacks embodied struggle—they tap rhythms and suddenly receive coordinates without meaningful internal conflict or cost. The final choice to record and teach lacks dramatic weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based discovery, but closure lacks decisive change—recording the discovery and planning to teach others feels procedural rather than transformative. The "delayed revelation" of the watermark provides knowledge but no visible cost or foreclosed path. Orientation is clear but the stakes never crystallize into a choice that matters.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong integration of setting as active participant—the station's instruments, steel table as metronome, and submerged canyon all constrain or enable discovery. The torn atlas page functions as micro-setting that directly shapes the revelation. However, sensory detail remains primarily visual/auditory without fuller embodiment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (discovering why paths disappear) is signaled early but never faces real pressure—the discovery arrives through patient observation rather than struggle or sacrifice. No meaningful tightening occurs; the revelation doesn't force a choice between competing goods or require trading anything valuable. Cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of lost connections between human charts and natural systems emerges through concrete particulars (bleached coral losing chemical gradients, ancient trade routes). The final image of the station as "both anchored and adrift" resonates metaphorically. However, the revelation feels neat rather than complex—no counter-reading challenges the discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with some distinctive phrasing ("drifting moored," "periodically eternal"), but lacks strong perceptual signature—Mara and Eli could swap observations without loss. Prose becomes abstract during key moments ("the ocean itself was holding its breath") rather than maintaining embodied perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and some evocative phrases. However, abstract formulations weaken key beats ("delayed revelation was not merely a cartographic curiosity"), and several passages restate concepts rather than advance them ("Future crews would be taught the same tapping method, a ritual that turned ordinary steel into a conduit"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of coral bleaching science with lost navigation paths offers a fresh angle, and "periodically eternal" memory creates an interesting temporal texture. However, the resolution—that ancient currents provided chemical gradients—feels convenient rather than surprising, and the discovery process lacks the specificity that would make it irreplaceable.</comment>
