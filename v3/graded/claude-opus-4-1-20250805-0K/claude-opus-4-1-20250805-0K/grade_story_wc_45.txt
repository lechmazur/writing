Looking at this story through an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through garden imagery, memory layers, and the recurring tooth motif rather than strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses act simultaneously - Thomas's evolved skepticism coexisting with "forgiving awareness," his yearning for the lost sister while loving the found one. The final choice to return the tooth carries visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("forgiving awareness that truth wore many faces").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Thomas's transformed understanding of healing as "transformation" rather than "restoration," with the garden becoming a "healing ground for creatures caught between." Cost is felt in the acceptance of permanent separation. The accumulative pattern of broken/healing imagery coheres well, though the three-year gap creates slight orientation wobble initially.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The secret garden functions as more than setting - it constrains choices (where "both worlds could touch") and charges the final image of "broken things learned to grow differently." Specific details like "jasmine tangled with forgotten roses" and "impossible blooms that flowered in every season" create a lived-in magical realism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through the revelation pattern - the substitute body's purpose, Mother's knowledge, Elara's transformation - each deepening Thomas's understanding. The dominant stake (accepting what sister has become vs yearning for what was) tightens when he must choose whether to keep or return the tooth, with visible cost in letting go.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the bone-setting metaphor: "sometimes the break teaches them a better way to bear weight." The final image of Thomas preparing tomorrow's tools while humming Mother's paradoxical song ("children who were exactly what they seemed, even when they weren't") offers resonant non-literal answer about identity and transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Thomas's medical-mystical perspective ("shrewdly innocent precision," "forgiving awareness"). Dialogue carries strong subtext, especially "Even changelings deserve their coin from the tooth fairy." Some register drift into elevated literary diction ("glamour that had fooled everyone") slightly above character's likely lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Deductions for overwriting in places ("clouds that never quite touched the earth anymore"), some template phrasing ("Thomas didn't startle anymore"), and occasional register drift. The filter-verb stack is minimal and the closure image remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling folklore with medical practice creates non-obvious angle. The bone-setting as metaphor for emotional/identity healing shows genuine innovation. The specific detail of keeping a changeling's baby tooth for three years as talisman transforms familiar fairy-tale elements.</comment>
