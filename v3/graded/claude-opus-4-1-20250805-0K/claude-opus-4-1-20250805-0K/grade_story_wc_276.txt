<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kova's cool-headed expertise drives meaningful choices through "voicing silence" and the final echo-catching, with internal complexity shown through her steady surface against "heart hammered rhythms." The transformation from fisher to voice-bearer lands with clear cost ("ready to be cast forward into the world's wounds"), though some interiority relies on telling rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens builds through sensory layering ("sound waves grew like vertical rivers," "constellations tumbled lower") to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kova absorbs the goddess's echo with visible cost. The closure transforms her from hunter to bearer of healing song, though the exact nature of the "world's wounds" remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden functions as active setting that constrains movement ("finding spaces between feelings") and enables the core action. Sensory specificity excels—"A child's laugh became silver vines. A widow's sob crystallized into blue thorns"—with the garden's physics directly shaping Kova's tactics and the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Kova's practiced stillness against the echo's testing ("circled her three times"), culminating in the dance of "pulled with silence, the echo resisted with ancient song." The cost lands clearly as Kova becomes permanently changed, though the seven-year preparation slightly diminishes the immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "voicing silence" and patterns breaking themselves, with the final insight "some songs never die, they just learn to swim in different seas" reweighting the entire hunt. The transformation from catching to becoming avoids easy resolution, though "world's wounds" edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice maintains consistency through inventive compounds ("somnambulant giants," "phosphorescent rain") and controlled rhythm that accelerates during the catch sequence. POV stays firmly with Kova, though occasional elevations ("liminal hours when dawn's rigid schedule crumbled") slightly exceed her established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The rail spike burned now, conducting frequencies that shouldn't exist"). Some metaphor density in peak moments ("prowling cat made of departed music") and minor register elevation, but momentum and clarity remain strong through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of fishing-for-sound with goddess-echo-hunting creates genuine freshness, especially the "voicing silence" paradox and transliteration of emotions into physical forms. Risk-taking in the lyric-surreal mode pays off with coherent world-logic and earned transformation (+0.3 within band for bold conceptual commitment).</comment>
