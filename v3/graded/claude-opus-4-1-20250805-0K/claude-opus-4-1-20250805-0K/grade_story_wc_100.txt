I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This story operates under a **Hybrid** lens, beginning with Causal mechanics (package arrives → Silas follows coordinates → discovers library) but shifting to Accumulative/Textural in its resolution, where the transformation of the library into a "place where rest had a permanent address" represents a Resonant Reconfiguration through accumulated metaphorical weight.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and rooted in his inherited insomnia curse, driving him to seek rest through helping others find it. His transformation from undertaker to "guardian of humanity's deepest dreams" feels earned through the accumulated weight of his forty years preparing the dead. However, interiority relies heavily on conceptual abstractions ("crystallized grief," "impossible spaces") rather than embodied emotion, and the Sleepless Librarians lack distinct characterization beyond their function.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Silas finds rest by giving it to others, with visible cost (abandoning his mortuary and earthly life). The causal chain from package to underwater descent holds, though the middle section's fantastical mechanics ("bubble of breathable grief") strain credibility without sufficient grounding. The hybrid lens shifts from causal to accumulative work, but the transition point remains ambiguous.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric work with the underwater library as "morgue for civilizations" and coral-encrusted columns supporting "vaults of preserved air." The setting constrains choices effectively—the underwater pressure requiring the lens's protection, the library's nature determining Silas's new role. However, the mortuary workspace receives minimal grounding, and sensory detail beyond the visual remains thin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Silas's quest for rest—escalates from personal insomnia to civilizational exhaustion, with meaningful deepening when he discovers the library's true nature. The transformation carries cost (leaving his life behind), though the middle section's conflicts feel abstract rather than visceral. The lens's pull provides coherent pressure, but the ease of the months-long transformation undercuts tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between preparing bodies and preparing civilizations for rest, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of Silas becoming "guardian of humanity's deepest dreams" resonantly reweights his undertaker role. The concept that "some spaces become possible only when we stop trying to escape them" arises from events rather than assertion, though occasional abstractions ("architecture of rest") edge toward the conceptual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with elevated, literary register appropriate to the material, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("rainbow ghosts," "crystallized into something he could inhabit"). The perceptual signature of an undertaker viewing everything through death-work holds throughout. However, syntax becomes uniform in longer passages, and the Sleepless Librarians' dialogue lacks distinction from narrative voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from overwriting in peak beats: "bubble of breathable grief—the accumulated sorrow of everyone he'd ever laid to rest" exemplifies the density problem. Multiple conceptual abstractions cluster without grounding ("impossible spaces between water molecules"), and figurative language appears in most sentences during the descent sequence. The final paragraph contains effective rhythm, but middle sections bog down in ornate description that obscures rather than clarifies action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The conceit of an undertaker treating dead civilizations transforms familiar material meaningfully. The broken lighthouse lens as consciousness-refracting device and grief becoming breathable substance show genuine imaginative reach. The synthesis of funeral rites with library cataloging creates fresh resonance, though some elements (Sleepless Librarians) feel more functional than surprising.</comment>
