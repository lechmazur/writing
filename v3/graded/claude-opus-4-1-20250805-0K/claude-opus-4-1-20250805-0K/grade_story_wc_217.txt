<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to "harmonize discord between what was lost and what remained" drives concrete actions throughout, from catching the feather to helping the boy reframe his broken kite. Her internal consistency holds through the piece, though the epiphany about morning feels slightly unearned. The boy functions effectively as secondary pressure that tests Mira's philosophy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds through layered images of brokenness (storm aftermath, broken feather, snapped kite string) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira helps the boy see beauty in damage. Cost is visible in "his face a study in loss" transforming to "clutching his broken kite like a treasure." The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, though the final insight about morning lacks full causal grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon and post-storm atmosphere create vivid sensory detail filtered through Mira's poetic perception. The drake's feather and broken kite constrain choices and charge the final image. However, the setting could pressure tactics more directly—the environment serves mainly as backdrop rather than active force.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through pattern accumulation (broken feather → snapped string → torn kite) with one meaningful deepening when Mira transforms the boy's understanding. The cost is legible in his shift from loss to treasure, though the stakes remain relatively gentle without forcing harder trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete handling of broken objects, avoiding explicit moralizing until the penultimate paragraph. The final image of the boy clutching his broken kite "like a treasure" offers a non-literal answer about finding beauty in imperfection, though the morning metaphor in the last lines edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mira's poetic perception creates a distinct voice through selective noticing ("each barbule a thread waiting to be woven into dawn"). The prose modulates appropriately, though some phrases like "burnished hush" and "hammered gold" lean toward overwriting. Dialogue feels natural and advances the boy's transformation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though figurative density occasionally slows the pace ("cobalt lagoon held its breath," "hammered gold," "burnished hush" in close proximity). The final paragraph contains a paraphrase loop where the morning metaphor restates rather than advances. Information density is moderate—some descriptive passages could do more work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story transforms the familiar "beauty in brokenness" theme through specific details like the drake's molting cycle and the kite's torn patterns creating new designs. The synthesis feels organic but not particularly fresh—the core insight about imperfection creating beauty is well-worn territory without a surprising angle.</comment>
