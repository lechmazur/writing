<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus's claustrophobia creates genuine internal contradiction that drives tactical choices (memorizing passages, calculating escape routes) and makes his transformation at closure earned. The "prudently adventurous" paradox manifests concretely in his preparation methods and descent decision. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("clawing at his chest") and the final paragraph's slight drift toward thematic summary rather than embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught spatial impossibility paying off in the nexus chamber where "space itself bent to human will." The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost—Marcus returns "transformed" and "paradoxical," having internalized the cartographers' rebellion. Orientation anchors (Marcus, blueprint study, tunnel entrance) establish cleanly within opening lines. Slight deduction for the mild exposition about the cartographers' mutiny that could have been more dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The impossible architecture of the nexus chamber ("corners that shouldn't exist, angles that hurt to perceive directly") constrains perception and enables the story's conceptual turn. The organ music functions as spatial coordinate system, guiding Marcus through "passages that rearranged themselves." Minor deduction for some generic starlight imagery and the slightly abstract treatment of the "spherical room where up and down held no meaning."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative pressure: descent → impossible geometry → organ music → shifting corridors → nexus discovery → transformation. The dominant stake (uncovering the cartographers' spatial rebellion) tightens when Marcus must trust the music despite his claustrophobia. Cost is conceptual but legible—Marcus sacrifices ordinary spatial understanding for revolutionary knowledge. Slightly weakened by the lack of a concrete oppositional force beyond his internal fear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of rebellion against fixed authority emerges organically through the cartographers' "spatial mutiny" and Marcus's transformation from fearful to "paradoxical." The organ's "wistful defiance" and the discovery that "space wasn't fixed...but something mutable" offer a non-literal answer about freedom through calculated rebellion. Strong integration of theme with plot mechanics. Minor deduction for slight abstractness in the final paragraph's thematic claims.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled elevation matching the story's conceptual ambitions—"geometric wound in the earth," "corners that shouldn't exist." POV remains stable with Marcus's perceptual signature intact (his claustrophobia coloring spatial descriptions). Some register drift in philosophical passages ("Space wasn't fixed, wasn't divine law") that slightly exceeds Marcus's established lexicon during peak discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong opening/closing lines. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Deductions for repetitive "Marcus understood" constructions, some filter verb clustering ("he heard it," "he thought of"), and abstract philosophical register in peak beats ("tyranny of ordinary space"). The prose serves the concept but occasionally prioritizes elevation over clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fusion of claustrophobia with exploration and the concept of spatial geometry as rebellion offers genuine freshness. The organ music as navigational system and the twin compasses as tools for "spatial rebellion" transform expected adventure tropes. The story commits fully to its premise of mutable space without retreat. Risk-taking in the impossible architecture descriptions heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
