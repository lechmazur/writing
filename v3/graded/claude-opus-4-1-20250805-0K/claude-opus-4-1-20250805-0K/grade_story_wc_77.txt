<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her death/resuscitation trauma, with internal conflict between repulsion and allure driving her nightly returns. The final choice to understand rather than flee Fear is earned through prior causality, though Cornelius's motivations remain somewhat opaque until late.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Story operates under Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Fear transforms from predator to companion. Closure lands with visible cost (Fear's imprisonment in the clasp) and Mara's acceptance of carrying it. Minor orientation wobble with Cornelius's nature initially unclear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The funhouse setting with bioluminescent mold creates vivid sensory detail that mirrors internal states, and the mirrors' ability to capture/project terror constrains choices throughout. Setting directly enables the final transformation when mirrors go dark.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal haunting to confronting Fear itself, with the paradoxical notes creating a meaningful tightening that forces Mara's final stance. Cost is legible when Fear becomes contained but Mara must carry it forever ("repulsive allure remained, but now she controlled it").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox that fear needs understanding rather than flight, with the final image of Fear transformed into "something smaller, manageable, almost beautiful" offering resonant answer without stating moral. The mirror motif and photography/memory elements reinforce theme throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice with gothic texture and controlled rhythm, though some elevated diction ("unbosom the secret") occasionally strains against accessibility. POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature in how Mara experiences the supernatural elements.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts, though occasional overwriting appears ("between decay and divinity," "silk being pulled through broken glass"). Information density is generally high with most lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of carnival horror with psychological haunting, transforming the "evil funhouse" trope through specific detail about Fear as lonely entity. The concept of fear being afraid of itself offers non-obvious angle that feels earned through the story's particulars.</comment>
