Reading this story through the lens of a demanding editor, I'll evaluate it as an Accumulative/Textural piece that builds through pattern and density toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory impulses—destroyer of lies yet seeker of truth—manifest concretely through her "volcanic tenderness" examining fragments. Her final transformation from arsonist to "keeper of imperishable memory" carries earned cost through the genetic memory revelation, though some internal states lean toward summary ("wasn't proud of her past") rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres well as each discovered artwork builds toward the archive revelation, with the tapestry fragment triggering recognition that reweights her entire destructive history. The closure—Mira becoming the first keeper in 300 years—lands with conceptual cost (her isolation, her criminal status) though the emotional price could be more viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The limestone corridors "that predated Rome" and air "tasted of copper and centuries" create atmospheric pressure, while the progression from library to monastery to underground archive constrains her journey physically. The weaving pattern encoding molecular structures particularly enriches the world-building, though some settings (flooded subway tunnel, condemned church) remain more listed than inhabited.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal obsession to ancestral legacy to humanity's "stolen capacity to make truth permanent," with each discovered artwork narrowing Mira's path toward her destiny. The cost—her isolation, criminal status, relationships as "distractions"—is acknowledged but could be more dramatically tested through present-scene pressure rather than reflection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus forgery deepens through the irony of an arsonist preserving memory, with the weaving metaphor linking creation and destruction. The final image of "destruction and creation unified in her scarred hands" resonates without stating a moral, though the ancestral memory concept borders on convenient mysticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "surgically precise" and "volcanic tenderness" that suit Mira's analytical-artistic fusion. The controlled, distant register matches her isolation, though peak moments could benefit from more syntactic variation to heighten pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and strong imagery ("lava cooling into new earth"), though some passages loop conceptually (the repeated emphasis on erasing/destroying in paragraph one). The "volcanic tenderness" motif effectively bookends the piece, but phrases like "systematically erased from history" and "elaborate lies" edge toward generic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a preservationist arsonist who burns forgeries to protect truth offers genuine freshness, particularly the weaving-as-molecular-encoding discovery. The genetic memory element risks convenience but is grounded through specific artistic breadcrumbs, earning its revelatory power.</comment>
