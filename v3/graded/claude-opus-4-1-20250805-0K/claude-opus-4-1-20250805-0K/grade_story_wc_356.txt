<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's transformation from ambitious rushing to patient understanding lands with earned cost through concrete sensory details and embodied responses to the corpse flower's growth. The sensitive nose trait creates genuine stakes and constraints throughout, though some moments of self-awareness ("she understood then that the flower's notorious odor wasn't corruption but communication") edge toward diagnostic clarity that slightly undercuts the visceral experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear accumulative/textural lens builds through patient tending, ancestral sketching, and village swaying to a resonant reconfiguration where Mira achieves "serenity within motion" at visible cost (enduring overwhelming stench despite sensitivity). The closure image of her swaying "rooted at last in understanding" crystallizes the transformation with felt weight, though the "undercurrent of wisdom" explanation mid-story slightly telegraphs rather than dramatizes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The treetop village's constant swaying creates a lived-in constraint that shapes every action, from cultivation methods to the final integration of motion into stillness. Specific details like "soil gathered from where lightning had struck" and "dew collected from spider webs at dawn" ground the mystical in tactile reality, though the forest floor remains somewhat distant and abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: mockery from other apprentices, the flower's slow germination responding to Mira's patience, culminating in the overwhelming bloom that tests her sensitive nature. The cost is legible when she breathes deeply of the terrible stench "despite her sensitive nose," though the middle section could tighten the pressure between her ambition and the required patience.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of motion/stillness, patience/ambition, and transformation/communication without explicit moralizing. The corpse flower's stench as "not corruption but communication" reframes understanding beautifully, and the final image of Mira swaying "rooted at last" synthesizes the paradox, though Master Thorne's articulation of the "undercurrent of wisdom" edges toward stating rather than embodying.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent mystical-botanical register with distinctive touches like "turning of the tide's thought" and sensory-driven perception. POV control is stable with Mira's olfactory sensitivity coloring observations throughout, though some moments of elevated diction ("liminal moment when understanding shifts from intellectual to embodied") slightly exceed her established lexicon during peak realization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm matching the village's sway, particularly strong in sensory passages about smell and cultivation. Some redundancy appears in explaining concepts ("not corruption but communication, not death but transformation") and occasional elevated register in peak moments, but information density remains solid with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of botanical tradition, olfactory sensitivity, and aerial cultivation creates a fresh angle on the patience-teaches-wisdom framework. The corpse flower's seven-year bloom cycle as teacher is inventive, and the family tradition of sketching on seed wrappings adds specific texture, though the core transformation arc follows somewhat predictable beats.</comment>
