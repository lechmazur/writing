<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margot's internal contradiction between exposing truth and protecting empire drives genuine tension through concrete choices (crafting the Tokyo misdirection). The rosewood nib kiss as "goodbye to honesty" embodies her moral compromise with specificity. Minor deduction for the convenient proxy death mentioned in passing without dramatized impact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: journalist's call triggers investigation → discovery of double truth → decision to create third lie. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Margot crystallizes her choice to perpetuate family patterns, with visible cost in her "goodbye kiss to honesty." The Geneva/board meeting contradiction resolves cleverly through telegram orchestration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Observatory setting constrains choices effectively—the isolation above clouds mirrors Margot's elevated yet detached position. Brass instruments "mocking the slippery nature of human truth" and stars arriving from different times enriches the temporal paradox theme. The vault where she locks the nib provides concrete closure action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from protecting father's reputation to preserving entire empire's foundation ("thirty years of carefully negotiated truces"). The pressure tightens when Margot realizes both accounts are true, forcing her active choice to obscure rather than reveal. Cost is legible in destroying journalistic truth for family legacy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the astronomy metaphor—"some orbits were designed never to complete"—without stating morals. The grandfather's hidden asteroid discovery creates resonant parallel to Margot's choice. Final image of locked nib reweights the opening's "tracking truth" into perpetual concealment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains sophisticated register appropriate to newspaper heiress with controlled rhythm ("orbits of regret, she thought, watching the loops form and reform"). Perceptual signature shows through astronomical thinking patterns. Minor filter verb cluster in middle section ("had seen," "had held," "had noticed") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The rosewood nib scratched its final period as dawn approached, clouds below beginning to glow like old newsprint held to flame"). Some repetitive "had + verb" constructions in the photograph analysis section. Clear propulsion through varied sentence lengths matching emotional beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of journalism thriller with astronomical metaphor creates non-obvious angle on truth/deception. The Tokyo misdirection as deliberate third option shows creative problem-solving. Margot choosing to perpetuate family patterns rather than break them resists expected redemption arc.</comment>
