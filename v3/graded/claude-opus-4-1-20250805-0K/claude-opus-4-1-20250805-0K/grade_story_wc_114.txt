I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, assessing each category for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's characterization succeeds through embodied perception of her oracle gift—"like sensation to frost-numbed fingers"—and her specific ability to hold contradictions. Her choice to stay, document, and protect the impossible flowers shows clear motivation with visible cost. The fever as catalyst for transformation works well, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("fault-tolerant by nature").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through fever, botanical discoveries, and electromagnetic revelation to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira adds her truth to the constellation of protected knowledge. The cost is legible—she must smudge her identity and file false reports. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the pattern of margins/hiddenness accumulates meaningfully toward closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mountain weather station setting actively constrains choices—isolation enables discovery, altitude affects perception, and the electromagnetic environment enables the flowers' existence. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("green-gold ribbons descending through the magnetosphere"). The setting's margins and official/unofficial spaces directly shape Mira's tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to witness and protect impossible truth—escalates through discovery of the illustrations, understanding their pattern, and witnessing the aurora flowers. Pressure coheres through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens. The cost of necessary deception and identity erasure is clear, though tension could tighten further in the middle section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the story's central metaphor of truths that exist in margins and require protection through deliberate obscurity. The flowers-as-impossible-knowledge resonates without stating a moral, and the final image of "weight of aurora light on mountain petals—both nothing and everything" offers a non-literal answer to questions of truth and measurement. No heavy-handed thematic statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with scientific precision ("magnetometer," "electromagnetic bath") balanced against poetic perception. POV control is strong—we know only what Mira experiences. Perceptual signature is distinct in how she processes multiple truths simultaneously. Some phrases edge toward purple ("ancient light," "electromagnetic sorrow") but serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythm variation and information density, with lines doing multiple jobs. However, several instances of elevated diction strain in peak moments ("electromagnetic sorrow," "constellation of impossible flowers"), and some repetitive phrasing around "truth" and "margins." The final paragraph's extended metaphor about weight, while thematically resonant, slightly over-explains. No major clarity issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of flowers that bloom only during magnetic storms, documented in hidden botanical illustrations, offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of scientific observation with liminal truth-keeping feels specific and earned. The story commits fully to its premise without retreat, though the "fever as revelation" device is somewhat familiar.</comment>
