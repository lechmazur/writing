I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's internal conflict between mathematical certainty and human regret drives authentic choices, particularly his deliberate introduction of entropy through the chipped die. His motivation crystalizes through the Sarah backstory which directly shapes his present tactics. The final stance of "patient urgency" and "grim optimist ascending" lands with earned complexity, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("hope was just poorly calculated probability").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through mathematical patterns, dice rolls, and the staircase's recursive nature toward a Charged Poise closure where Marcus's calculated faith in entropy crystallizes. The seventeen-billion-step revelation reweights everything with clear cost (Sarah's lifetime). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The lens holds consistently through mathematical accumulation and pattern-breaking.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The staircase functions as both setting and constraint, with its perpetual motion mathematics directly shaping Marcus's tactics (seven-step pattern, calculated rupture points). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered through mathematical perception. The chipped die as micro-setting charges the final image effectively. Some descriptions lean abstract ("dimensional space he couldn't quite perceive") but serve the conceptual framework.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative deepening: from climbing to understanding the loop's true nature to actively engineering its collapse through entropy. The dominant stake (escape through mathematical rupture) tightens as Marcus's understanding deepens. Cost is visible in Sarah's lost life and Marcus's seventeen-year imprisonment. The tension between perpetual motion and introduced imperfection creates genuine pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between mathematical perfection and human imperfection, with the chipped die embodying this paradox. The story resists simple morals about choice versus determinism, instead offering complexity through Marcus's "measured recklessness." The final image of ascending "one proven step at a time" resonantly answers whether freedom exists within deterministic systems.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct mathematical-architectural voice with consistent POV control and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature strong through mathematical filtering of reality ("three months now, or perhaps three minutes"). Some register elevation in philosophical moments ("mathematics became theology") fits the conceptual piece but occasionally distances. Rhythm modulates effectively between technical precision and emotional undertow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong information density and purposeful rhythm variation. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("where mathematics became theology and proofs became prophecy") and occasional abstraction. Minor template cadence in "Marcus had..." constructions. The mathematical terminology is precise and serves character. Opening and closing lines effectively frame the piece, though some middle passages edge toward conceptual redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical determinism with human agency through the perpetual motion staircase concept. The chipped die as deliberate imperfection in a perfect system offers genuine originality. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat. While drawing on familiar infinite loop tropes, the mathematical proof framework and seventeen-billion-step human lifetime calculation provide specific transformation.</comment>
