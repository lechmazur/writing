I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered reflection and sensory detail toward a resonant reconfiguration where Marcus accepts his role as preserver rather than performer.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's internal contradiction between expertise and self-doubt manifests concretely through his handling of the speaker cloth, with embodied memory ("His fingers remembered wrapping it around cable runs"). The final choice to embrace preservation as performance lands with earned cost, though some interiority veers toward over-articulation ("longing not as emptiness but as space waiting to be filled").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands effectively - Marcus's reframe of "preservation itself was a form of performance" carries emotional cost through his public humiliation. The accumulative structure coheres as sensory details of the cloth trigger deeper recognition. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the quarry setting's significance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer functions as more than backdrop - its acoustic properties ("walls holding echoes of explosions the way venues once held their music") mirror Marcus's internal state and constrain his work. The speaker cloth's material specificity ("fifteen-ounce weight suggests JBL D-series compatibility") grounds the narrative in tactile expertise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Marcus's recognition of the specific cloth from his past tour, narrowing from professional appraisal to personal reckoning. The cost manifests in his acceptance of translating rather than escaping his past, though the internal nature of the conflict limits dramatic escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of sound waves preserved in fabric - "holding the ghost vibrations of every performance." The final insight about preservation as performance reweights earlier material without moralizing, particularly strong in "once, it had been real."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with Marcus's technical precision bleeding into emotional territory ("confidently uncertain," "cataloging with detached precision"). The perceptual signature of noticing acoustic frequencies and material properties stays character-specific, though some passages drift toward writerly register ("communion between stage and floor").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of resonant precision ("The quarry office trailer creaked in the November wind") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("that created communion between stage and floor") and abstract phrasing. Information density is generally strong, with most sentences advancing character or atmosphere simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of an ex-roadie finding meaning through material authentication offers fresh specificity. The transformation of failure into expertise through loss ("identifying other people's treasures because he couldn't bear to look at his own") provides genuine complexity without forced balance.</comment>
