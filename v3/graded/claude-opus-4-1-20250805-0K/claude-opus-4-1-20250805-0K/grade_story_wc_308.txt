<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Yula's centuries-long stillness as active navigation creates genuine internal contradiction between her younger self's belief in movement and her current mastery through stasis. The choice to remain motionless for 300 years carries visible cost in the "dust coated shoulders like a second skin," though the emotional progression feels slightly abstract in places.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure as Yula's own voice returns after 300 years, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where past and present converge with clear temporal cost. The piece teaches its pattern of stillness-as-navigation early and pays it off when the wandering pulse reveals itself as her younger voice, though the conceptual cost could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The canyon of bone towers and calcified remains creates a unique acoustic environment that directly enables the story's temporal navigation premise. Details like "creatures that had sung themselves to death in pursuit of the perfect resonance" establish world rules that constrain possibilities, though some descriptions lean toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mastering navigation through stillness rather than movement—deepens through the revelation that Yula can access temporal layers by remaining a "fixed point." The wandering pulse finding its source provides meaningful tightening, though the internal conflict lacks the visceral pressure expected at this grade level.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of movement through stillness, with the arrowhead's migration patterns ironically guiding someone who hasn't moved in centuries. The final exchange between past and present voices offers a non-literal answer about persistence and transformation, avoiding explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled, meditative rhythm matching Yula's centuries of stillness, using phrases like "navigation happened in stillness" and "libraries of sound." The perceptual signature shows someone reading time through acoustic patterns and bird formations, though occasional register elevation ("temporal currents could eddy and flow") slightly strains the POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clean, purposeful prose with strong information density—most sentences advance multiple story elements simultaneously. Rhythm varies naturally between longer meditative passages and shorter declarative moments, with no significant loops or scaffolding, though a few metaphors border on overwriting ("canyon of endless echoes stretched like a wound").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a "harmonic stone skimmer" who achieves mastery through centuries of stillness rather than movement offers a fresh paradox. The specific synthesis of acoustic archaeology, temporal navigation, and bird-pattern reading creates an original world-logic that feels inevitable within its own rules.</comment>
