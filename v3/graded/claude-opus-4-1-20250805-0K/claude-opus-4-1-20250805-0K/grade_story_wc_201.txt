<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied trauma responses with precise proprioceptive detail ("wrists turned at precise angles, shoulders hunched exactly twenty-three degrees") and layered internal conflict between survival mathematics and mercy. The transformation from victim to teacher lands with earned cost, though some therapy-speak ("mathematics of mercy") edges toward abstraction in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens builds through sensory layering and pattern recognition toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lyra transforms trauma formulas into teaching. Cost is visible in the abandoned pewter strap and the choice to remain in exile helping others. The closure lands but relies slightly on conceptual assertion ("mathematics of healing from the decimals of her pain") rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The UV forest creates a unique sensory environment only enhanced survivors can perceive, constraining choices and enabling new possibilities. Vivid detail like "Purple-white fronds cast shadows that existed in spectrums normal humans couldn't perceive" and Fibonacci spiral moss grounds the otherworldly setting that shapes the final teaching moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal survival through trauma recall to choosing transformation over escape, with the UV forest sanctuary offering both exile and opportunity. The turn from victim to teacher shows agency, though the middle section could tighten the pressure between remembering trauma and finding its inverse equations.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of mathematical inversion—calculating "reciprocals" of cruelty to find mercy. The final image of teaching a child to see patterns in the forest's glow resonates without stating a moral, though "mathematics of mercy" occasionally veers toward explicit thematic labeling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through enhanced proprioception creates a unique POV filter ("could feel every nerve ending, every muscle fiber, the exact angle"). Voice maintains consistency through trauma and recovery, though occasional register drift into clinical language ("proprioceptively enhanced nervous system") slightly disrupts immersion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong sensory specificity and varied rhythm, but some conceptual redundancy around the mathematics metaphor and occasional overwriting ("decimals of her pain"). The paraphrase loop around formulas/equations/mathematics weakens momentum in places without adding new pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of enhanced perception, trauma recovery, and mathematical thinking creates an original angle on survivor narrative. The UV forest as sanctuary for the enhanced and the inversion of torture mathematics into healing formulas shows genuine ingenuity, transforming familiar elements through specific detail.</comment>
