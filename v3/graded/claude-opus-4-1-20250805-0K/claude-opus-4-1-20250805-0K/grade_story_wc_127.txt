I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory detail and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration about incomplete truths as mercy.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's internal contradiction between professional detachment and the pull to "subsume these emotions herself" creates genuine tension. The final choice to maintain her cardinal rule ("never consume the merchandise") demonstrates earned restraint with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("affectionate detachment") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Vera's harvest of "incomplete truths, each one a small mercy" reweights the entire premise with conceptual cost - the recognition that "sometimes the kindest thing wasn't to give people whole emotions, but to offer them the parts they could bear to hold." The accumulative lens holds consistently through sensory detail building toward this crystallized insight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber grotto's transformation at dusk creates tangible constraint - Vera has "perhaps another minute" before walls seal. Static electricity as sensory anchor is vivid and consistent. Deduction for some abstract descriptors ("liquid gold") and missing concrete spatial choreography of Vera's movements through the grotto.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from harvesting emotions to resisting personal consumption ("It would be so easy to absorb them all"). The temporal pressure of dusk's transformation creates urgency. Cost is visible in Vera's choice to remain emotionally incomplete herself while trafficking in others' severed sentiments.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of half-truths as "merciful lies that are truer than honesty itself." The widower example crystallizes this perfectly - wanting "his wife's laughter without the silence that followed." The ending reweights all prior harvesting as acts of compassion rather than exploitation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and consistent POV. Strong perceptual signature in how Vera reads emotions through static discharge. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("molecular structure loosening") that slightly exceeds the established voice's naturalistic range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deductions for some figurative density in places ("pools of liquid gold," "burgundy spread") and one instance of abstract phrasing ("affectionate detachment") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of an emotion dealer who harvests half-truths from amber is highly original. The specific synthesis of static electricity, fragrance chemistry tools, and emotional preservation creates something genuinely fresh. Risk-taking in the conceptual premise pays off with coherent world-building.</comment>
