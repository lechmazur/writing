<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's guilt-driven obsession with documenting rivers after failing to save a drowning teenager creates compelling internal contradiction, particularly in his "daringly methodical" nature that both caused his failure and drives his attempted redemption. The transition from numbed medication to sharp-edged reality embodied through physical sensations (ivy's fingers, crumbling brick) grounds his emotional state effectively. Minor deduction for the slightly rushed epiphany about rivers teaching "to let go" which could have emerged more organically from his map-drawing scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Marcus's journey from obsessive documentation to acceptance building through graffiti wisdom, map-drawing, and the ivy metaphor, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where he begins "Mile marker zero." The cost is visible in his five years of guilt and manic documenting, though the final transformation feels slightly accelerated. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~100 words (disused station, three weeks off medication).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ivy-covered station functions as more than setting—it embodies transformation ("decay into something living") that directly charges Marcus's final realization about moving forward. Specific details like graffiti layers "like sediment" and the bathroom's "decades of wisdom" create lived-in authenticity. The accordion bellows' patches marking "each field season" grounds his obsessive chronicling in physical detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding self-forgiveness after the drowning incident—escalates through Marcus's interaction with graffiti wisdom, particularly "The river knows what the bridge denies" forcing him to confront his avoidance. His act of drawing his own map including "himself, standing there, failing" represents meaningful agency. The cost accumulates through "five years" of obsessive documenting and medication, though the resolution arrives somewhat quickly for the weight of guilt established.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The river-as-forgiveness metaphor develops organically through Marcus's scientific chronicling, the graffiti's "Forgiveness is a river, not a lake," and the ivy's patient conquest, avoiding heavy-handed symbolism. The theme emerges from concrete details rather than abstractions, particularly in how "rivers don't flow backward" parallels his inability to undo the past. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit articulation "the current that carries us forward is the same one that teaches us to let go."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Marcus's scientific-obsessive voice comes through in precise details like "pH readings," "mayfly larvae," and his methodical naming conventions, creating a distinct perceptual signature. The shift from clinical observation to emotional recognition tracks naturally with his medication withdrawal. Some passages like "guilt had worked into his bones" lean toward familiar phrasing rather than maintaining his unique analytical lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective variation between short declaratives ("The accident.") and complex observations about the station's transformation. Information density is high in passages like the bellows description carrying both physical decay and emotional history. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("patient conquest," "ghost of the station's former purpose") and the somewhat rushed final paragraph's philosophical declarations that could have remained more grounded in image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of a guilt-ridden scientist obsessively documenting rivers after failing to save someone offers a specific angle on redemption narratives. The graffiti-as-wisdom device and the accordion bellows as physical manifestation of his obsession show originality. However, the water/forgiveness metaphor and the epiphanic resolution through found wisdom are somewhat familiar territory in literary fiction.</comment>
