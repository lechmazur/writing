I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered reflections and symbolic resonance rather than causal plot turns, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margaret's grief-driven motivation to transform loss into presence is earned through concrete details (Thomas's notes in margins, wrapped paintings). The contradiction between moving on versus moving with crystallizes in her choice to carve differently than Thomas planned. Minor deduction for slight emotional tidiness in resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the clock face without hands as crystallized time holding love. Cost is visible in "three years since Thomas died" and the transformation required. Accumulative structure coheres well but relies heavily on reflection (approaching 30% threshold), though each reflection anchors in present carving and alters Margaret's understanding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The loft studio with rain-beaded skylight creates atmospheric pressure, and the kettle's timing constrains the carving session effectively. Wood grain and tools function as micro-setting that shapes choices. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from workbench to kettle to return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of how to carry love forward after loss deepens through the carving process, with the kettle deadline creating mild temporal pressure. The shift from believing love was temporary to recognizing it crystallizes shows meaningful deepening. However, lacks a sharp reversal or heightened cost moment beyond steady accumulation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of presence persisting in absence emerges organically through the carved clock face and discovered artifacts of Thomas's influence. The final image of the clock that "would never tell time, only hold it" offers resonant non-literal answer. Slight deduction for one instance of mild thematic articulation ("Love wasn't temporary just because life was").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in how Margaret notices wood grain, measures time by kettle, sees "tears that wouldn't fall" in rain. Voice maintains consistency through emotional modulation. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor filter verb clustering in middle section prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves solid momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density good with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for two paraphrase loops ("Love wasn't temporary"/"It crystallized" sequence and the "moving on"/"moving with" repetition) and slight overwriting in metaphorical density during reflection passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The clock face without hands as meditation on crystallized time offers fresh angle on grief narrative. Specific detail about Thomas as lion tamer who carved adds originality. The synthesis of botanical illustrator learning woodcarving from circus performer feels non-obvious yet inevitable.</comment>
