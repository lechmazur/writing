<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to uncover corruption is grounded in his ability to see ghosts and his grandmother's legacy, with contradictory impulses (staying with the ghosts vs. taking action) playing out in scene. The final choice to gather evidence and sit with the ghosts shows earned agency with visible cost—the "weightless burden" he inherits. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("worn down by guilt") rather than fully embodied states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details about corruption accumulate through ghost encounters, ledgers, and the mainspring's significance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marcus accepts his grandmother's role and the ghosts find peace. Cost is legible in "feeling their weightless burden" and the commitment to expose truth. The closure lands with both revelation and responsibility, though the cost could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned circus building and dust patterns effectively constrain Marcus's discovery method and create atmospheric pressure. The mainspring barrel functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when wound. Setting details like "dust motes spiral through the last shaft of evening light" and the specific dust accumulation patterns directly enable the key discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from investigating an elevator to uncovering decades of corruption that killed multiple people, with Marcus's choice to engage deepening when he understands his grandmother's role. The ghosts' vigil ending provides visible cost. However, the resolution lacks immediate opposition or trade-off—Marcus faces no real resistance to his decision to expose the truth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring motif of mechanical failures as sites where truth surfaces—"drawn to the cracks in the facade between working and broken." The final image of turning off the fluorescent to see "honest darkness, where the cracks in the facade showed clearly" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The weightless burden metaphor effectively captures inherited responsibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Marcus notices mechanical details and ghost behaviors ("skillfully observant of the dead; they communicated through repetition"). Voice modulates appropriately from technical observation to emotional recognition. Some register drift into elevated diction ("silk-lined repose," "vigil finally ended") slightly outside the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Information density is high in discovery sequences. Deductions for template cadence in ghost descriptions ("a maintenance man, a building manager, an actress"), some filter-verb clustering ("Marcus could still hear," "he'd felt"), and occasional overwriting ("yellow as old teeth").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story with corruption investigation, where ghosts appear at sites of mechanical failure rather than traditional haunting. The specific detail of analyzing dust patterns to find evidence shows originality. The transformation of the grandmother from inspector to saboteur who saved lives adds unexpected depth, though the resolution follows somewhat predictable lines.</comment>
