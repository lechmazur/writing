<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's grief-driven determination and Thomas's guilt create genuine internal conflict with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (longing vs. letting go, protection vs. imprisonment). The final choice to beckon him "not to save me, but to be saved" reverses expected dynamics with earned causality. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("screaming tenderness") and slight therapy-speak in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with jasmine scent as recurring intensifier building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Thomas materializes—a "new way of being" with visible cost (neither fully human). Orientation anchored immediately (lighthouse, dawn, Mara). The three-year backstory block (~20%) anchors in present action and tilts Mara's stance through her discovery of Thomas's liminal state.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse and jasmine scent constrain choices—the scent becomes the mechanism for crossing dimensions, the lighthouse beam enables materialization. Sensory detail selective and POV-filtered (cool stone, salt air, static electricity). Setting actively participates in closure when lighthouse beam solidifies Thomas.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reuniting with Thomas) signaled early and deepens through discovery of his guilt-prison to final materialization. Escalation follows accumulative pattern: releasing scent → climbing stairs → seeing shimmer → touching → solidifying. Cost visible in final state: "not fully human, perhaps never again fully human."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: love that transcends death requires releasing protective guilt. The jasmine motif accumulates meaning from sealed potential to explosive garden sensation. Final image of two shadows dancing reweights the opening's solitary vigil without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Mara's grief-filtered awareness (lighthouse's "ancient pulse," Thomas as "shimmer"). Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from established register ("molecules of intent," "dimensions on frequencies"). Voice maintains consistency through emotional peaks with controlled modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though several instances of abstract phrasing dilute immediacy ("vibrations of intent so pure," "gentle violence of refusing"). Template construction appears in emotional descriptions. Information density high in action sequences but some scaffolding in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle on ghost story through materialization mechanism (purified intentions manifesting across dimensions). The specific synthesis of lighthouse keeper vigil with dimensional crossing feels earned. Risk-taking in the ambiguous final state creates meaningful complexity without gimmickry.</comment>
