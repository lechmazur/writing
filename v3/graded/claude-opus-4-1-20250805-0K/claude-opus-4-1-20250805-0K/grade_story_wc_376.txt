I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds density through recovered fragments, crystallized messages, and the final accumulation of truth-telling that reweights the greenhouse city's foundations.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's gift creates genuine constraint that drives every choice, from piecing fragments to the final decision to deliver all messages. The contradiction between her truth-sensing ability and her loneliness effectively motivates the ending's willingness to "watch the greenhouse city's carefully maintained peace dissolve." Minor deduction for slightly abstract emotional states ("regret," "exhaustion") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Vera's decision to transcribe and deliver all crystallized messages fundamentally reweights the city's social contract, with explicit cost: "even if it meant watching the greenhouse city's carefully maintained peace dissolve." The accumulative structure - fragments → map → crystallized messages → grandmother's truth → decision - builds coherently under the textural lens. The "dead zones between safety and poison" perfectly crystallizes the thematic and physical space where truth waits.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic sky creates persistent constraint, from living-leaf communication to the abandoned pneumatic tubes where sound crystallizes. The maintenance tunnel's "walls sweating condensation that smelled of copper and regret" exemplifies strong sensory specificity. The dead zones between greenhouse and poison become essential to both plot mechanics and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: postal fragment → map pieces → intercepted communications → grandmother's crystallized confession about the water diversion. Each discovery narrows Vera's options toward the inevitable choice between maintaining peace or delivering truth. The cost is explicit: dissolving the city's "carefully maintained peace" and accepting that "some truths were worth wilting for."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the crystallization metaphor - truths literally crystallizing in dead zones, preserved but undelivered. The grandmother's line "truth, like water, always finds its way" resonates without moralizing, especially given the water diversion revelation. The final image of "dead zones between safety and poison...where the most important words went to wait" offers a non-literal answer to questions about truth's value.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical register ("breathing leaves," "golden ink would refuse to flow"). The perceptual signature shows in how Vera experiences dishonesty physically: "hands would tremble, vision would blur." Some register elevation in places ("sanctuary for two generations") but generally maintains coherence. Dialogue in the crystallized messages effectively captures different voices.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "walls sweating condensation that smelled of copper and regret." Some density issues with stacked metaphors ("breathing leaves that served as the greenhouse city's only reliable communication" could be tighter). Minor scaffold in "She understood now" and slight overwriting in the final paragraph, though the closure image lands effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of conversations crystallizing in temperature differentials where greenhouse meets toxic barrier is genuinely fresh. The synthesis of truth-sensing, environmental constraint, and crystallized sound creates an organic world-logic. The water diversion reveal transforms what could be simple dystopia into complex moral territory about necessary lies versus devastating truths.</comment>
