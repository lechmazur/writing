<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reaper's motivation to name her fears after discovering her predecessor's similar wound creates clear causality, with contradictory impulses (isolation vs. connection) acting throughout. The transformation from unnamed monsters to "companions" shows earned change with visible cost—eternal isolation as the price of saving love. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("hollow ache," "vast hurt") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (monsters gaining dimension, then dissolving) that reweight the dominant stake of confronting eternal loneliness. The closure—transforming fears into companions through naming—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost: "to save what you love and be erased by the saving." The recordings discovery → observatory climb → naming sequence maintains clear causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory with its brass instruments and dome constrains the reaper's ritual (requiring celestial alignment for the monsters to crystallize). The atlas page functions as micro-setting that enables the central choice. Sensory detail effectively narrows during the naming sequence. Deduction for some generic descriptors ("bruises" for dusk) and limited use of non-visual senses.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes clearly signaled: confronting eternal loneliness after sacrificial love. The crystallization of monsters escalates pressure, forcing the reaper to name specific fears (Absence, Forever). Cost is unmistakable: "never again be seen by living eyes. Never again be remembered." The naming ritual meaningfully tightens options—either succumb to formless grief or transform it through acknowledgment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of naming monsters—giving form to shapeless grief diminishes its power. The echo motif (sacrifice, recordings, phrases) accumulates without forcing. The final image of "carrying her atlas of conquered fears" offers a non-literal answer to handling eternal loss. Minor deduction for one instance of theme-speak ("vast hurt had been survived before").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with selective noticing (brass instruments, wax cylinders, medieval cartography details). Voice modulates effectively from contemplative to ritualistic during the naming sequence. Some register drift into elevated diction ("psychopomps," "celestial mechanics") slightly above the established voice. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph lengths. Information density is good—most lines advance multiple purposes. Deductions for figurative density in non-peak moments ("paint the sky in bruises"), some abstract phrasing ("hollow ache," "vast hurt"), and minor template cadence in the "She [verb]" pattern across several paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reaper mythology with cartographic fear-naming creates a non-obvious angle. The specific transformation of sea monsters into psychological companions through light crystallization shows originality. The concept of multiple generations of heartbroken reapers leaving messages elevates beyond standard psychopomp tales. Some familiar elements (saving a lover, eternal isolation) prevent higher scoring.</comment>
