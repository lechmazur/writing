<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cassia's revolutionary past actively shapes her archaeological interpretation, creating a coherent through-line from defeat to new purpose. The moment where she recognizes the Venusians as "another civilization's last desperate attempt at preservation" effectively links her prison experience to present action. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("emotion she couldn't quite name") but the final choice to translate their whispers shows earned agency with clear cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from shard to ghosts to translation plan, with the final image of Cassia translating whispers while temporal storms paint "liquid history" achieving resonant reconfiguration. The cost is legible in "some defeats were simply preparations for unimaginable victories" - her revolutionary failure transformed into archaeological purpose. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the baroque asteroid setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid with its draped mirrors and temporal streams creates genuine constraint - the mirrors must be covered during storms because they show "possibilities, failures, what we might have been." This directly enables Cassia's breakthrough understanding of the Venusian crystals. The visible timestreams as "ribbons of amber light" and the gilded chambers with weeping cherubs create vivid specificity that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from handling the shard to challenging protocols to demonstrating the ghosts to proposing resurrection. The dominant stake (ownership/interpretation of Venusian artifacts) tightens when Cassia shifts from defensive to offensive with "I'm proposing we stop treating them like artifacts." Cost is visible but could be more concrete - the emotional weight lands but practical consequences remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between Cassia's failed revolution and the Venusians' preservation attempt - both seeking to build "something beautiful from the ashes." The final insight that "defeats were simply preparations for unimaginable victories" reweights all prior material without moralizing. The covered mirrors hiding "possibilities, failures" create resonant subtext about transformation and seeing clearly through loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in how Cassia reads temporal patterns "the way she once read tactical maps" and her poet's cadence. Dialogue between Cassia and Huang carries clear subtext and goal-pursuit. Deduction for occasional register elevation that strains POV credibility ("baroque chambers," "crystalline matrices") and some filter-heavy passages in the middle third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective variation, but several issues accumulate: redundant phrasing around "failed revolutionary" concept, abstract descriptors ("impossible colors," "unimaginable victories"), and occasional overwriting in figurative language ("shard caught light like frozen tears, its edges singing"). The final paragraph achieves strong momentum but earlier sections have density issues with concept-repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of archaeological dispute with revolutionary memory creates genuine freshness - using defeat as a lens for understanding extinct civilizations. The baroque asteroid housing Versailles recreation is wonderfully specific. The visible timestreams and covered mirrors during temporal storms show imaginative world-building. Slight deduction for relying on familiar "lost civilization in crystals" trope without fuller transformation.</comment>
