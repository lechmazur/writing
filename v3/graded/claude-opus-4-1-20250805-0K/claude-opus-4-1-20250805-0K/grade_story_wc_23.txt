<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to shepherd others through the reverse migration while resisting her own cellular pull creates genuine internal contradiction acted out through physical struggle with the bronze foot and the manual crank. Her choice to remain as guide rather than follow crystallizes with visible cost in "I walked it myself... before I learned that some of us are meant to stay." The brother's call forces her to confront the price of her role when she must guide him through deadly terrain she once traversed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marina's crystallized stance as permanent navigator, with clear cost in resisting her own blood's pull toward ancestral soil. The causal chain from hydraulics failure to manual operation to cryptic guidance holds, though the reverse migration concept could use one more beat of concrete grounding. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3, and the closure lands with "she would not leave" paying off her earlier admission of having walked the path herself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The poisoned geography—sulfur fields, detection drones, quarantine roads—constrains Marina's guidance and creates specific navigational challenges. The bronze censer foot functions as micro-setting, its weight anchoring Marina physically while she works, becoming "warm as a living thing" to charge the final image. Spatial details like "seven degrees north of the burned church" and satellite shadows confusing drones show lived-in knowledge of this devastated landscape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from general navigation duties to the specific crisis of Marina's brother trapped in the lethal sulfur fields, forcing her to draw on personal experience. The waning moon's effect on her strength creates genuine physical struggle with the manual crank, though this constraint could pressure one more tactical choice. Cost is visible in Marina's permanent separation from those she guides and her resistance to her own cellular longing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of necessary shepherds who sacrifice their own journey to guide others emerges through Marina's concrete actions rather than statement. The bronze foot carrying grandmother's prayers despite the temple's destruction resonates with Marina as keeper of old frequencies and lost geographies. The final image of Marina held "between worlds" by the warm bronze artifact reweights her fragmented identity as purposeful rather than broken.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marina's voice maintains consistent texture through selective perception ("scarred hands trembling," "poisoned corridor") and dialogue that carries subtext of false hope ("They'll return by morning"). The cryptic midnight instructions feel authentic to emergency communication, each line pursuing the goal of survival guidance. Minor slip in "raw certainty" feels slightly elevated for the established register, but overall the piece sustains its worn, pragmatic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks, particularly in the dialogue sequences. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "The array groaned, shifted an inch" showing both success and limitation. Some filter verb clustering appears ("Marina understood," "Marina knew") and "vast indifference" tends toward abstraction, but the closing image lands with concrete power.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The reverse migration as involuntary cellular response to dying earth offers a fresh angle on climate displacement narratives. Marina's role as stationary navigator using antiquated equipment and "cryptic phone calls at midnight" creates specific texture. The synthesis of environmental catastrophe with ancestral pull, complicated by those who must guide rather than follow, feels earned through lived detail rather than concept alone.</comment>
