<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's reckless idealism and the hole in her soul create clear, embodied motivation that drives her descent and ultimate choice to bite the apple. The internal contradiction between her need to fix things and awareness of the cost ("trammel your own fate") generates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the keeper's dialogue veering toward diagnostic label-speak ("That's your gift and curse"), but the final fusion of destinies lands with earned transformation and visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through bone-and-bark imagery toward a Decisive Change when Mara bites the apple and fuses destinies. The closure lands with visible cost ("not stolen from the dead but gifted, transformed") and reconfigures both characters' paths into "something neither she nor Elena could have achieved alone." Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of the keeper's appearance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard setting directly constrains choice through its rules about bartered destinies and shapes the final transformation. Vivid sensory detail ("phosphorescent fruit," "roots threading through ribcages") creates atmosphere while the carved names and ossuary walls add specificity. The environment evolves from "half-lit corridors" to brightening with Mara's resolved purpose, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to take Elena's destiny and "trammel" her own fate—escalates through deepening understanding from warning to discovery to choice. The cost is legible when Mara accepts the fusion knowing it binds her "forever to another's interrupted story." The apple functions as both complication and resolution with clear agency. Minor deduction for the keeper's appearance feeling slightly staged rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of traded destinies and incomplete stories, avoiding direct moralizing until the keeper's brief commentary. The burned tarot card's transformation from prediction to "promise" and The Fool's completed step offer resonant answers without stating a thesis. The fusion of "fiercely gentle revolution" with "reckless belief" creates thematic synthesis. Slight deduction for the keeper's on-the-nose articulation of Mara's nature.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent POV. The perceptual signature shows in selective attention to bone-bark fusion and phosphorescent details. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("You always were too eager to fix everyone"). Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("dusky resolve settling into her bones like sediment") that slightly exceeds the established voice's lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Strong opening and closing lines that mirror transformation. Deductions for metaphor density in places ("forgotten veins," "half-lit corridors," "cathedral of bone and bark" clustered closely) and one instance of elevated diction ("inlaying meaning") that creates mild register drift. Some filter-verb clustering ("she felt," "she understood") in the transformation sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard concept offers a fresh synthesis of death and renewal through the specific mechanism of traded destinies growing as fruit. The transformation of The Fool card from burned prediction to ash-promise shows originality. The fusion of two incomplete destinies into a third path avoids simple resurrection. Modest deduction for relying on somewhat familiar mystical-orchard imagery, though the bone-root integration adds specificity.</comment>
