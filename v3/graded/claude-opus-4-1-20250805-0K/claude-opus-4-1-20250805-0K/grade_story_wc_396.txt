<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's transformation from enforcer to gardener earns its arc through concrete discovery, though the keeper remains more archetype than individual. The apple-tasting moment embodies change viscerally. Internal complexity shows in her shadow-weaving shift from armor to invitation, but emotional states occasionally tell rather than embody ("understanding flooding through her").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds through mirror glimpses and apple symbolism to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira becomes gardener rather than enforcer, with clear cost (abandoning her enforcement role). The orchard's impossible warmth and temporal fractures establish stakes early. However, the merchant's backstory arrives late without sufficient present-frame anchoring, and some causal links feel asserted ("This is why the ice never claims this place").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard's impossible warmth above grinding ice creates vivid contrast that shapes every choice. Mirrors containing trapped glimpses of compassion function as micro-setting that constrains the narrative. Sensory details filter through Mira's peacekeeper perspective effectively ("shadow-laced uniform rippling with borrowed darkness").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether anomalies serve violence or peace—establishes early and deepens through mirror revelations showing the merchant's shattered denial transformed into "countless gentle teachings." Mira's choice to become gardener rather than enforcer shows agency with cost. However, escalation relies heavily on revelation rather than active pressure, and the keeper poses no real opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the orchard's transformation of violence into understanding, crystallizing in Mira's final shift from enforcer to gardener. The mirrors showing "what compassion could build" avoid direct moralizing. However, some thematic statements edge toward explicit ("Warmth generates from understanding"), and the merchant's revelation feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's perceptual signature shows in how she reads "emotional architecture" and experiences shadows as bridges rather than weapons. The keeper's dialogue carries weight ("Violence breeds in groups. Peace grows in solitude"). Some interior passages drift toward explanatory ("understanding her true mission") rather than maintaining embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("apple trees rooted in soil that should have frozen solid decades ago") with varied rhythm. However, abstract telling intrudes ("understanding flooding through her"), and several passages loop concepts without advancing pressure. Filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("she realized," "she understood").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard as an empathy-mapping anomaly offers fresh synthesis of magical realism and moral transformation. Mirrors containing glimpses of compassion-built futures avoid cliché. The shadow-weaving peacekeeper who transforms darkness from weapon to bridge shows originality, though the wise keeper archetype feels familiar.</comment>
