<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong characterization with Marcus's ministry extending beyond prison walls and Eliza's inherited grace contrasting Thomas's destructive hands. The transformation from "hands made for destruction" to teaching repair earns the closure, though some interiority edges toward therapy-speak ("maybe we deserve better than carrying his breaks forever").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the clockwork repair metaphor building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Eliza chooses transformation over perpetual grievance. Cost is legible in "He deserved worse than he got" acknowledging justice while accepting the burden of moving forward. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~60 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The workshop setting functions as more than backdrop—tools and light patterns mirror emotional states, particularly "light pierce through the workshop's high windows, breaking across her face in patterns that revealed and concealed her grief." The clockwork mechanism's intricacy ("gears smaller than rice grains") constrains the repair process and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of whether Eliza can transform Thomas's apology into healing escalates through the repair process, with tension in "Will you stay? I might need—another perspective." The cost lands in accepting help from someone connected to her brother's execution, though escalation could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the repair metaphor without stating morals—"teaching his sister that some things, once shattered, could be rebuilt even stronger than before" resonates without preaching. The "second opinions" concept deepens from religious absolution to collaborative healing, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voices with Eliza's "vibrant hush" delivery and Marcus's ministerial restraint. The perceptual signature shows in how Marcus notices light patterns while Eliza focuses on mechanical precision. Minor register elevation in closing paragraphs ("sure as grace") slightly exceeds established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "dust motes danced in those same fractured beams," though some redundancy appears ("broken shafts of gold"/"fractured beams"). The ending slides into elevated diction ("steady as absolution, sure as grace") and contains mild paraphrase loops in the final two paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on forgiveness through the specific lens of clockwork repair as inherited skill bridging victim and perpetrator. The premise avoids easy redemption—"He deserved worse than he got"—while finding a non-obvious path through mechanical precision rather than emotional confrontation.</comment>
