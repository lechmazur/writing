<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lucia's journey from numbness to feeling through vibration rather than sound creates genuine internal conflict with embodied sensation ("the thawing," feeling music "in her teeth, her ribs, her skull"). The final choice to embrace silence as music shows earned transformation with visible cost—the further wearing of the needle mirrors her acceptance of loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through reversed music creating physical resonance that bypasses hearing, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence becomes "enthralling" music. Cost is legible in the worn needle and the acceptance of permanent deafness, though the transformation could use one more concrete obstacle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cavern's legendary acoustics become tactile through stone vibrations, with setting actively constraining choice—Lucia must use this specific space for its amplification properties. Sensory detail shifts from auditory to tactile ("cool stone floor," vibrations "crawling up through bones"), making the environment essential to her transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking sound to discovering vibration-based connection, with the worn needle creating increasing "filament of hush between each vibration." The protagonist's agency drives the experiment, though the conflict could benefit from more concrete resistance before the breakthrough.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of backward music moving forward, with the broken needle teaching that "we must move in reverse to find our way forward." The final image of earth's "backward recorded song" resonantly reweights the entire journey without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through tactile sensation replacing auditory ("fingers reading the air's subtle pressure changes"), with controlled lyric compression in passages like "the symphony written in stone and skin." Some filter verbs ("she felt it then") slightly dull immediacy in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths matching emotional intensity, though some paraphrase loops appear ("emotional permafrost"/"layers of numbness"/"scar tissue"). Information density high in sensory passages but occasional abstract phrasing ("something deeper—the physical memory") could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The reversal of music as healing method and deafness as transformation rather than loss offers fresh angle on familiar territory. The specific detail of the jury-rigged needle creating necessary imperfection adds originality, though the metaphor of emotional thawing trends slightly familiar.</comment>
