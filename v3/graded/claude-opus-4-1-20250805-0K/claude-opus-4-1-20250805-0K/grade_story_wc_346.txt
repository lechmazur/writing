<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation through quantum threads and adjustment duty is clear, with strong embodied emotion in his interaction with the puppet head. The transformation from mathematical adjuster to singer of time shows genuine internal conflict acting in scene. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "nested patterns" and "terrible knowledge" that edges toward therapy-speak without full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through nested imagery, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marcus inherits Eliza's burden and transforms humanity's relationship with ending. Cost is visible in "terrible love and impossible hope" and the irreversible transformation. Who/where/when anchored early through lighthouse setting and dusk timing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting constrains and enables the final transformation through its lens apparatus conducting light. Vivid sensory work with "bruised plum and copper" dusk and "pane of hush" silence. The puppet head functions as micro-setting that charges the final image through its cracks becoming "veins of gold."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from adjusting microseconds to singing time itself into new shapes, with clear tightening as Marcus accepts Eliza's burden. The transformation from mathematical precision to "untrained, cracking" song shows agency accepting imperfection. Cost visible in the irreversible nature of the inheritance and humanity's "terrible love and impossible hope."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the puppet's beautiful flaws becoming "veins of gold" - damage transformed into beauty through acceptance. The final image of shared solitude across time offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through the lighthouse beam turning inward rather than outward, suggesting internal rather than external salvation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "nested patterns," "quantum threads," and technical time-adjustment language that marks Marcus's scientific mindset. Voice modulates effectively from analytical observation to lyrical transformation. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("vouchsafe this burden") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structures. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for some abstract loops around "nested patterns" repeated without variation, occasional purple moments ("horizon's wound"), and filter-verb clustering in the middle section ("felt the weight," "understood now," "watched").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper tradition with quantum time adjustment creates an original premise. The transformation of mathematical precision into lullaby and the puppet's flaws becoming light-conducting channels show genuine ingenuity. The concept of adjusting time through song rather than mathematics offers a non-obvious angle on the doomsday clock trope.</comment>
