<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kira's augmented sensory abilities and role as "last sensory map maker" create clear, consistent motivation throughout, with embodied perception ("fingertips that could taste temperature variations") grounding her unique POV. The final choice to teach rather than translate shows agency with visible cost—abandoning her unique translator role. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("ancient joy glowed amber") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where Kira shifts from translator to teacher. The fossil's dissolution and her role transformation create visible cost. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Kira, coastal caves, post-hibernation Earth). Minor deduction for slight causality softness in how the fossil "unlocks" her abilities.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The limestone caves' emotional absorption properties and bioluminescent organisms create vivid, purposeful setting that directly enables the story's central discovery. The electromagnetic harness and sensory details filter through Kira's augmented perception consistently. The caves constrain and enable her final choice. Slight deduction for some abstract descriptors ("conscious darkness") over concrete detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from documenting emotional residue to encountering non-human consciousness, with the fossil's dissolution marking irreversible commitment. The entity's thermal communication creates genuine pressure forcing Kira's choice between translator and teacher roles. Cost is visible in losing her unique position. Minor deduction for relatively smooth progression without sharp reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of communication across species/consciousness boundaries emerges organically through Kira's sensory mapping work, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of "sensory cartography of a species learning to dream while awake" resonantly reweights the hibernation/awakening framework. The fossil as transitional object pays off thematically. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in places.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled scientific-poetic register ("factually mystical," "emotional topology") that maintains consistency. Perceptual signature strong through augmented sensory details. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("liminal space between sleeping and waking") that slightly exceeds POV naturalism under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density good with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting in figurative language ("conscious darkness," "strange new dance") and mild template cadence in middle sections ("She drifted... She adjusted... She began"). Final paragraph maintains momentum despite density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of hibernation pods, emotional heat-mapping, and consciousness evolution creates non-obvious premise. The idea that emotions leave thermal signatures in limestone during humanity's absence shows genuine ingenuity. Transformation of sensory mapping from documentation to interspecies communication adds originality. Execution generally strong though some elements feel slightly familiar.</comment>
