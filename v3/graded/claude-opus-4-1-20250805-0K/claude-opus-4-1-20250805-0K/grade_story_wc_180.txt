I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as the piece builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara's return transforms both the space and her relationship with Mira.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses operate in scene through Elara's trembling hands "not from age but from memory" and her lie about packing the wrong bag. The final choice to teach Mira is earned through specific prior causality—the daughter's death, the guild schism, and the dying quartz eyes. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("born of grief, not wisdom") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as deciduous vows fall away and three generations bridge through the mending arts, with visible cost in Elara confronting her daughter's death and breaking her sworn isolation. The accumulative lens holds as imagery (trees through rafters, hanging eyes, blue ribbon) builds density toward the final image of tools "ready to be passed on." Orientation anchors establish who/where/when efficiently.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral hybrid setting directly constrains choices—Elara must climb rope ladders among branches to reach the dying eyes. Environmental specificity ("seeds carried by wind and bird...roots threading through stonework like determined fingers") creates a lived-in world that shapes the mending work. The transformed space mirrors theme perfectly without forcing symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: dozens of dying quartz eyes represent sight and hope, Mira's challenge forces Elara to confront her vow, and the mending work requires teaching what Elara had sworn to keep isolated. The tightening occurs when Elara realizes "wisdom isn't preserved through isolation but through teaching," foreclosing her path of protective withdrawal with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the deciduous vow metaphor and the orchard-cathedral transformation—rigid structures giving way to organic growth. The final image of tools "humming with satisfaction, ready to be passed on" offers a non-literal answer about tradition's survival through adaptation. Minor deduction for one instance of stated theme ("wisdom isn't preserved through isolation") though it's earned by the scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled imagery ("quartz-eye mender," "deciduous vows") and natural dialogue that carries subtext, particularly Mira's "You're late" opening. Some filter verb accumulation ("she saw," "she glimpsed") dulls immediacy in the middle section. The perceptual signature remains consistent—a mender's precise attention to crystal and light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. Deductions for filter verb clusters ("she glimpsed," "she saw"), some template cadence in the middle ("She showed...She gestured...She considered"), and occasional overwriting ("peculiar fruit from silken threads"). Information density is high in most passages but dulled by these artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy mending arts with abandoned sacred space creates an original world. The concept of crystalline eyes as replaceable organs and the orchard-cathedral transformation feel specific and non-obvious. Risk-taking in the metaphorical framework (deciduous vows, organic cathedral) heightens stakes while maintaining clarity. Within-band bonus of +0.3 for conceptual boldness.</comment>
