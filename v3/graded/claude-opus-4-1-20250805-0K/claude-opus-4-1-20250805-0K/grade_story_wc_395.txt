Looking at this story through a demanding editorial lens for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern recognition, metadata traces, and recurring numbers toward a resonant transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lila's motivation flows clearly from personal loss (father's disappearance) to professional obsession with Pattern User 4827. Her choice to initiate the protocol despite knowing the cost demonstrates earned agency. The "brightly attentive" trait manifests concretely in her pattern recognition. Loses points for some diagnostic self-awareness ("knowing that in data archaeology, coincidences were breadcrumbs") that lacks embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from investigation through discovery to voluntary transformation. The closure lands with Lila becoming Pattern User 8625, a Decisive Change with visible cost (leaving physical existence). The pattern teaches itself through the 4827 recurrences and archive metaphors. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the shadow network concept.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The archive setting functions as both physical space and metaphysical realm, with towers of servers as "graveyards" effectively establishing atmosphere. The coordinates hidden in recipe measurements show creative specificity. Setting constrains choice when Lila must use the archive's own systems to join the disappeared. Some spatial choreography remains vague in the middle sections.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from missing person case to discovering an entire shadow network to choosing transformation. The dominant stake (finding the truth about disappearances) tightens when Lila realizes her father's fate connects to the pattern. Cost becomes legible when she "created her own breadcrumb trail" before pressing enter. The personal cost of becoming archived lands clearly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of digital persistence versus deletion. The concept that "absence was just another form of presence" resonates without being stated as moral. The Apollo-X mission patch creates a physical anchor for the father-daughter connection across digital void. Final image of "where deleted files go—they go home" reweights the entire investigation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with technical precision balanced against emotional undertow. POV modulates effectively from clinical investigation to personal revelation. Some register elevation in places ("infinite library of human connection") slightly exceeds the character's established lexicon. The perceptual signature of noticing patterns others miss stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose generally maintains momentum with varied sentence structures. Information density high in discovery sequences. Minor issues with some elevated diction ("substrata," "retroactively") and occasional redundancy ("supposedly deleted," "supposedly went to die"). The final section achieves strong rhythm as Lila makes her choice. No major loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of digital consciousness persisting in archived data offers fresh angle on missing persons narrative. Specific innovation in the communication through "liked posts" and "duration gaps between deleted voice messages." The Apollo-X connection adds unexpected depth. Transformation of social media archive into purgatorial space shows genuine originality.</comment>
