I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Martha's motivation through grief-work and inherited craft tradition is clear and embodied through concrete actions like feeling the stone's grain. The spectral grandfather presence creates genuine internal conflict between solitary mastery and collective witnessing. Minor deduction for the grandfather's voice arriving somewhat conveniently to guide the work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as monarchs, carving, and memories layer toward the memorial's completion. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration when Martha reads the hidden poem aloud, transforming private grief into "endless conversation." Cost is visible in the grandfather's fading and Martha's solitary evening. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse constrains and enables the work—monarchs' presence times the carving, glass walls hold/release words. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("cool glass," "indigo threads," "salmon sky"). The milkweed-monarch ecology and gravestone workshop create lived-in specificity that shapes Martha's choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of completing the collective memorial intensifies through the grandfather's urgency ("The migration won't wait") and November deadline. The seventeen families' gathering creates meaningful pressure that forces Martha's transformation from solitary craftsperson to community witness. Cost visible in the grandfather's departure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the monarch migration metaphor—individual losses traveling together "guided by something ancient." The woven ribbon pattern physically embodies connection without minimizing individual pain. Final image of words carried south with butterflies offers resonant, non-literal answer to collective grief's shape.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm ("thundering calm," "fiercely meditative"). POV remains stable in close third. Minor issues with occasional elevated diction ("spectral presence," "collective strength") that slightly exceeds Martha's established lexicon during non-peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose generally clean with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density high in passages like the families' losses. Some filter verb accumulation ("Martha felt," "she suspected") dulls immediacy in middle section. Final paragraph achieves strong momentum without loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The spectral grandfather teaching stone-carving transforms the mentor-ghost trope through specific craft knowledge and the parallel with butterfly migration. The collective memorial concept offers fresh angle on pandemic grief. The hidden poem in the weaving's core provides earned surprise that reweights prior material.</comment>
