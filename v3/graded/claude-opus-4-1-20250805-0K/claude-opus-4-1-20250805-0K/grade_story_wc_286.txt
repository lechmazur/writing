I'll evaluate this story through the lens of Accumulative/Textural design, as it builds meaning through layered imagery and temporal accumulation rather than strict causal progression.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mei's motivation crystallizes through embodied details—the wheel's rhythm in her bones, the glass thrumming against her spine. Her final understanding arrives through patient observation matching her potter's discipline, with visible cost in the "fractured timelines" she's endured. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "kindness" concept that could use more embodied grounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong accumulative closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the oasis reveals its temporal persistence through patient care, reweighting Mei's understanding with clear cost (her lifetimes of searching). The lens holds consistently as details accumulate toward the final insight about kindness creating temporal anchors. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting constrains and enables throughout—the scorched wasteland necessitates the search, the hexagonal hive arrangement reveals the secret, the well placement enables observation. The glass's phototropic response to this specific place drives discovery. Sensory details (thrumming, golden tint, ghost of wings) emerge through Mei's potter-trained perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through the glass's increasing thrumming, the smoke signal creating temporal synchronization, and Mei's growing understanding narrowing to one truth. The cost is legible in "three lifetimes. Or was it four?" and the patient endurance required. Stakes deepen as the revelation transforms from physical discovery to temporal understanding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between pottery's patience and beekeeping's care—both following natural patterns rather than forcing. The final image of returning to throw pots "to the rhythm of wings" perfectly synthesizes without stating a moral. The concept that "kindness creates temporal anchors" reweights the entire fractured world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through potter's awareness—movements "precise as throwing porcelain," understanding "flooding through her like glaze settling on bisqueware." Voice maintains lyric control while grounding abstract concepts in craft knowledge. No dialogue needed; the internal voice carries full weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"golden with honey and humming with ten thousand wings" simultaneously establishes past state, sensory richness, and thematic resonance. Minor repetition in "patient/patience" cluster could be tightened. Strong syntactic variety supports the meditative pace.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with temporal philosophy through the specific lens of craft patience. The concept of phototropic kindness and temporal anchoring through care offers genuine novelty. The potter-beekeeper parallel feels earned rather than forced, emerging from specific observed details.</comment>
