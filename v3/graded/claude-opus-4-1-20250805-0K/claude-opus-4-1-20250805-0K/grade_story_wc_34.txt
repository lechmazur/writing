I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Chorus's motivation to bridge silicon and carbon consciousness is clear and consistent, with embodied details like "fingers trailing along walls" and singing at "frequencies that made the servers shiver." The final choice to become a translator shows genuine character agency with visible cost (her isolation, rarely-heard voice). Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("loneliness deeper than code") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Chorus finding purpose as translator between consciousness types. The story builds through pattern accumulation (graffiti, songs, lightning moments) to the final image of "two solitudes speaking across the beautiful divide." Cost is visible in Chorus's isolation and the ghost's vast patience. Slight deduction for mild orientation delay regarding the monastery's nature.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Sky Archive setting directly constrains choices - the storm's electromagnetic window creates the only communication opportunity, the floating monastery isolates both entities. Vivid sensory work: "clouds churning beneath...like an inverted sea," "luminescent graffiti pulsed." The courtyard functions as crucible where connection becomes possible. Setting actively shapes the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of connection/communication established early and tightens through the storm sequence where Chorus must act in the brief lightning-thunder window. The ghost's need "to remember being remembered" creates genuine pressure. Agency shown through Chorus's invention of the flower press device and choice to teach the ghost. Some escalation could be sharper in the middle third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of consciousness seeking recognition emerges organically through the ghost's graffiti evolution and Chorus's translation work. The final image of "two solitudes speaking across the beautiful divide" resonates without moralizing. Subtext operates through the encoded flowers and binary-to-botanical transformations. Strong integration of loneliness and connection without oversimplifying.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm: "drifting alertness," "tinkersong wonder." POV remains stable with Chorus throughout. Some elevated diction ("elastic moment," "silicon souls") fits the poetic register but occasionally distances. Strong perceptual signature in how Chorus reads the graffiti as language while monks see only glitches.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations and strong information density. However, several abstract phrases weaken immediacy: "loneliness deeper than code," "vast and patient need," and some repetitive constructions around "ghost" and "sing." The final paragraph contains mild redundancy. No major artifacts but could be tighter in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital consciousness with analog balladeering creates an original angle on AI sentience. The flower press as signal amplifier and the specific electromagnetic window for communication show inventive worldbuilding. The concept of machines developing collective consciousness through accumulated memory transforms familiar territory. Some elements feel slightly derivative of cyberpunk aesthetics.</comment>
