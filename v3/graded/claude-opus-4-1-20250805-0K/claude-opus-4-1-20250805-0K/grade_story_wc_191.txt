<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Anya's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as lore keeper, with concrete embodied details like the ruby flake growing warm against her hip. The internal realization about democracy's rejection drives a meaningful stance shift, though the epiphany about the colonists' choice arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient internal contradiction or struggle in the moment of discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Conceptual Repricing closure where Anya's understanding reweights the entire quest—the throne's purpose is to remain unclaimed as a monument to restraint. The causal lens holds with clear because/therefore linkages from waterfall entry through paint layers to revelation, and the cost is legible in humanity's deliberate rejection of power after fleeing autocracy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall, bio-luminescent orchard, and layered paint murals create vivid, purposeful settings that directly enable discovery. The environment constrains choice through the sunrise deadline and the paint's UV-reactive properties, though some descriptions like "glitching memory" feel slightly overwrought for the POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the stairway of ascension before sunrise—drives clear escalation through paint layers revealing progressively deeper truths. The pressure tightens as each layer recontextualizes the quest, though the conflict lacks visceral opposition or genuine risk of failure since discovery proceeds smoothly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paint layers' revelations about power, democracy, and collective knowledge versus hoarding. The final image of Anya carrying "the future's memory of a past that chose not to repeat itself" resonantly answers the central question without moralizing, though phrases like "humanity's greatest monument to restraint" edge toward explicit theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with effective free indirect style ("They chose not to rule," Anya murmured). Perceptual signature shows in details like "rainbow fractals dance across her environmental suit's visor," though some passages drift into elevated register ("the future's memory of a past") that slightly exceeds Anya's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in discovery sequences. However, several overwrought phrases ("wisely adventurous steps," "sailed into the dark rather than bend to tyranny") and minor redundancies ("the throne remained unclaimed...the unclaimed throne") create occasional density without advancing meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of archaeological discovery revealing anti-authoritarian history offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic colonization. The specific synthesis of data fragments forcing collective knowledge-sharing and the throne as monument to restraint feels earned, though some worldbuilding elements (Terra-9, binary sunlight) use familiar SF furniture.</comment>
