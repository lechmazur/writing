<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a craftsperson seeking "truth in the space between" authentic and performed selves is clear and consistent. Her micro-choices (chalk selection, photographing patterns, naming process) reveal values under the constraint of limited time. The character reads as specific rather than archetypal, though internal contradiction could be more actively dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mira's daily ritual crystallizes the story's conceptual premise about identity creation with visible dedication cost (ephemeral chalk work). The accumulative/textural lens holds through density of craft details building toward the final image of "seeds of an older, newer world." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned arcade constrains Mira's work spatially and temporally (morning light, rain erasure), while sensory details filter through her professional priorities (chalk scraping, colored dust, brass catching light). The setting actively shapes her practice through its emptiness and architectural features. Environment participates in closure through the gate-locking ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving human connection through craft) established early and deepens through accumulation of process details. The three-hour constraint provides mild pressure but doesn't force difficult trade-offs. Cost is primarily conceptual (ephemeral work) rather than dramatically contested, fitting the textural lens but lacking sharp escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete details about identity-crafting in a post-digital world without explicit moralizing. The final image of "seeds of an older, newer world" resonantly reweights the entire naming process as cultural preservation. Subtext operates through the juxtaposition of failed futuristic promises against deliberate analog craft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through Mira's craftsperson lens ("constellation of symbols," "colored dust"). Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm that breathes with the meditative process. No head-hopping or POV leakage; psychic distance remains stable and appropriate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose maintains strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (setting/character/theme). Some mild repetition around "chalk" and "symbols" but serves accumulative pattern. Sentence variety creates natural rhythm; paragraphs vary purposefully. Minor filter verb clustering ("could hear," "could see") slightly dulls immediacy in middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of postal renaissance with pseudonym creation offers non-obvious angle on identity and connection. The specific profession and its chalk-code methodology feel invented rather than derivative. Risk-taking through quiet, process-focused narrative heightens thematic stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
