I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered confessions and discoveries that reweight meaning, culminating in Mara's transformation through accumulated recognitions rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's transformation from professional distance to vulnerability is earned through concrete discoveries, with contradictory impulses acting in scene ("found herself reaching for her inspection knife" despite "professional distance"). The final choice to reconnect carries visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("vulnerability felt too much like the disasters") in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara's understanding transforms her stance, with felt cost in her recognition of "the real apocalypse is the distance we create." The accumulative lens holds as confessions layer to create transformation. Minor orientation delay (bunker owner's identity comes late) but serves the discovery structure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Crystal caves and pearl effectively constrain and enable the story's emotional arc - the physical space mirrors psychological barriers. The shell's spiral becomes functional setting through the etched confessions. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("natural phosphorescence," "hairline fractures that sparkled like veins of hope").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation of confessions leading to Mara's own participation, with clear cost in her admission "I'm terrified of living above ground, where hearts can break." The pearl's increasing radiance provides textural escalation that forces stance crystallization. One meaningful deepening that changes Mara's options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pearl/cultivation metaphor - isolation transformed into "concentrated light." The ending offers a resonant answer about connection without stating a moral. Strong thematic coherence between Crown's legacy and Mara's transformation, though edges toward explicit in "the real apocalypse" line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Mara's inspector lens shifting to personal vulnerability. Clean free indirect style with controlled psychic distance shifts. Some register drift into elevated diction ("resonant hush," "latent radiance") that occasionally strains against the professional inspector POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations matching emotional beats. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("constellation of reflected possibilities") and some template phrasing ("She thought of... She thought of..."). No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bunker/apocalypse prep with emotional isolation metaphor feels earned and specific. The pearl as cultivation experiment for human connection is non-obvious. The inspection report subversion ("structural integrity compromised by excessive luminosity") shows creative integration of premise and theme.</comment>
