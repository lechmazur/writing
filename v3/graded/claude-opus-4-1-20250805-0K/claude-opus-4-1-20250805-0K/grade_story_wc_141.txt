<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's progression from skeptical investigator to participant is earned through concrete discovery (the shell's resonance, the cello's response), with her final choice to help finish the instrument carrying visible cost—abandoning her myth-busting identity. Claudia's emergence feels slightly convenient but her function as pressure/catalyst works. The piece effectively uses contradictory impulses (investigating vs participating) in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marina's shift from debunker to preserver, with the cost visible in her abandoning her professional identity. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory discoveries (shell hum, cello harmonics, layered conversations) build toward the final image of the observatory as "repository of human longing." Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively shapes the investigation through its decay (fallen panels, rusted stairs) and abandoned objects (unfinished cello, scattered papers). The painted shell and cello function as micro-settings that constrain choice—Marina must engage with them to understand Tern's discovery. The cliff location reinforces isolation and the "keeping time" waves in the final line charge the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional investigation to personal participation as Marina discovers the ephemeral compass tracks emotional rather than physical navigation. The tightening occurs when she must choose between busting the myth or preserving it, with her professional identity as the visible cost. Pressure builds through accumulative discoveries rather than reversals, fitting the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "unfinished conversations" without explicit moralizing. The ephemeral compass concept deepens from supposed madness to universal human experience of regret. The final image of waves "keeping time for all the conversations still being rewritten" offers resonant closure without stating a lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina's perceptual signature shows through her investigative habits (humming unconsciously, myth-busting instincts flaring) and professional skepticism yielding to wonder. Dialogue between Marina and Claudia feels natural with appropriate subtext. Some filter phrases ("Marina understood suddenly") could be stronger, and occasional register elevation ("repository of human longing") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose generally maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Some overwrought phrases appear ("dying moths," "white as sea foam") and the metaphor density occasionally peaks high ("echo chamber" in an already metaphor-rich ending). Information density is strong—most lines advance discovery or deepen atmosphere. Minor template patterns in dialogue tags.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The ephemeral compass as emotional rather than spatial navigation offers a fresh angle on the "mad scientist" trope. The specific synthesis of astronomy, music, and unfinished conversations creates an organic whole. The transformation of myth-buster to myth-preserver feels earned through particular details rather than generic revelation.</comment>
