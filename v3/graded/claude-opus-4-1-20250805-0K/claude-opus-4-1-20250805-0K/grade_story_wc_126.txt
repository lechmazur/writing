<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's gift of hearing "melodies in the spaces between sounds" drives her discovery of beauty in imperfection, with the mendicant's bowl filling with offerings marking genuine change. The internal contradiction between preserving tradition and accepting transformation plays out through embodied action rather than declaration. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient arrival sequence of musicians.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the "chronic hush" transforms into "quietude that held space for the incomplete," with visible cost in the lost rainforest and damaged instruments creating new harmonics. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through layered musicians joining, building to the final image of "perfect incompletion." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in opening paragraphs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse with its "amphitheater of glass and brine" actively shapes the acoustic discovery, while shipwrecks provide percussion and water adds rhythm. Setting constrains choice through the specific acoustics that transform damaged instruments into new harmonics. The flooded foundation and cracked panes create the exact conditions needed for the story's sonic transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal silence-breaking to communal rebirth through accumulation of musicians, each addition deepening the texture. The cost is legible in accepting imperfection over restoration—"not the polished performance Echo Harbor had once prized." One meaningful deepening occurs as incomplete music becomes the new form rather than failure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of "unfinished songs hold their own perfection," embodied in damaged instruments creating unexpected harmonics. The final image of "perfect incompletion" resonantly answers the question of how to continue after loss without stating a moral. Slight deduction for the grandmother's wisdom feeling somewhat pre-packaged, though it pays off through dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with musical metaphors naturally embedded ("notes that seemed to rise from the greenhouse itself"). POV remains stable with Mara's acoustic perception filtering observations. Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("mendicant's bowl," "chronic hush") slightly strains against more grounded character moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("shipwrecks ringed the greenhouse like broken teeth") with strong rhythm variation. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "chronic hush"/"quietude" repetition, and the final three paragraphs restate transformation without added pressure. Template cadence in musician arrival sequence ("A child appeared...Then an old man...They came one by one").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of environmental disaster with musical rebirth through architectural acoustics offers a non-obvious angle. The specific detail of damaged instruments creating new harmonics through greenhouse acoustics shows originality. However, the community-gathering-through-art resolution follows familiar patterns without sufficient transformation.</comment>
