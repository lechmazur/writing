<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sarah's methodical nature and haunted ambitions create consistent motivation that drives her to consume the seed despite understanding its weight. The contradiction between scholarly detachment and obsessive pursuit plays out concretely through her choice. Minor deduction for the convenient alignment of her personality being "preparation" rather than genuine internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered discoveries culminating in Sarah's transformation - a Decisive Change with visible cost (accepting all previous keepers' burdens). The closure lands with "consciousness seeks consciousness across any distance" reweighting the entire investigation. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the magnetic arbor location.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor with its silver trees and electromagnetic fruits constrains Sarah's choice through its physics - she must decide quickly after the spirit departs. The seed's crystalline structure and bioluminescent patterns provide specific sensory detail that charges the transformation. Environment directly enables the closure through electromagnetic field reorganization of atoms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: tablet translation → magnetic field discovery → arbor arrival → seed vision → transformation choice, with each layer adding pressure through the "inheritance" burden. The spirit's departure creates time pressure ("must choose quickly"). Cost is visible in accepting "haunted ambitions of all who came before" though the actual difficulty of this burden remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bridge between ancient wisdom and modern science, with the seed serving as literal knowledge made tangible. The ending offers a non-literal answer about consciousness transcending time through any medium, reweighting Sarah's "methodical nature" as cosmic preparation. Minor deduction for the slightly neat resolution of her personality being perfectly suited.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains scholarly precision with phrases like "wedge-shaped impressions" and "electromagnetic resonance" fitting Sarah's academic POV. Perceptual signature shows in how she processes through analogical thinking and cross-referencing. Some register elevation in the final paragraph ("consciousness seeks consciousness") slightly exceeds established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between discovery and reflection. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for repetitive "Sarah + verb" constructions in middle sections and slight overwriting in "beautiful geometries" and "romantic speculation."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor as ancient electromagnetic laboratory offers a fresh synthesis of mysticism and physics. The concept of consciousness imprinting on electromagnetic fields and crystallizing into inheritable seeds transforms the knowledge-fruit trope. Slight deduction for the convenience of Sarah's personality being cosmically predetermined.</comment>
