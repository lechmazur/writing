I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens**: Causal - the story follows a clear because/therefore linkage as Marcus's failed experiments lead to his discovery that destruction enables transformation, culminating in his creation of the living staff.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in thirty years of failure, with concrete internal conflict between preservation doctrine and his discovered truth about transformation. The final choice to destroy the crozier halves is earned through thirteen prior attempts. Deduction for some therapy-speak ("letting each failure cut deep enough to teach") and slight emotional tidiness in resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change when Marcus creates the living staff through destruction, with visible cost (his blood sacrifice) and transformation from "hopeless alchemist" to "something altogether more dangerous." The causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkages. Minor deduction for slightly mechanical resolution of the creation process.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Ember Nexus effectively constrains choice as the only place hot enough for transformation, with vivid sensory detail ("glowed like a dying heart"). Setting actively shapes the climactic action through its superheated properties. Deduction for some generic fantasy elements and limited sensory range beyond visual/thermal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate clearly from personal vindication to spiritual transformation, with twenty-three attempts showing persistence under pressure. The cost is visible (blood sacrifice) and the protagonist's agency drives the resolution. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marcus realizes "the crozier wasn't meant to be restored. It was meant to be reborn."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through destruction emerges organically from events, particularly in "Destruction was just creation wearing a different mask." The final image resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral. Slight deduction for occasional thematic explicitness and the somewhat neat resolution of the creation/destruction paradox.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled rhythm and appropriate register for fantasy setting. POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Some effective compression ("Seven attempts... Twelve prayers..."). Minor deduction for occasional filter phrases and slight register elevation in philosophical passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is adequate with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for some overwriting in figurative language ("frozen bloom of his potential"), occasional redundancy, and template phrasing in the attempt sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The core concept of holy destruction offers a moderately fresh angle on familiar fantasy tropes. Marcus's specific journey from failed alchemist to heretical creator provides particularity. However, the magical staff creation and monastery setting feel somewhat derivative of fantasy templates without sufficient transformation.</comment>
