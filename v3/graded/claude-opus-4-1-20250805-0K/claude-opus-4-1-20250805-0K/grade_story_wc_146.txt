<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bell tuner's motivation is clear and consistent—restore the town's harmony through collective movement—with concrete embodiment through her measured walks and tuning fork rituals. Her "infinitely patient" trait manifests in three years of methodical work despite initial dismissal. The transformation from skepticism to belief earns the final departure, though internal contradiction could be sharper in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern teaching (footstep rhythms) that builds to Resonant Reconfiguration—the town literally rebuilds through collective movement. The closure lands with visible cost (three years of patient work) and conceptual repricing of what holds cities together. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two, though the "collapse" timeframe could be more causally integrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cobblestones, archway, fountain, and bell towers all constrain or enable choices—the tuner must press her fork against specific surfaces, people must walk particular patterns. The setting actively participates in the resolution as cracks seal and water returns. Sensory detail focuses on sound/vibration appropriately for the concept, though some descriptions trend toward the generic ("ancient archway").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—saving Millhaven from collapse—is signaled early and deepens through accumulation as more townspeople join the walking patterns. The tightening occurs when physical structures begin responding to collective movement. Cost is visible in the three-year commitment and daily ritual required, though agency could be stronger in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor: "Cities aren't made of stone. They're made of harmony." The footstep patterns as prayer, the heartbeat metaphor, and the final image of continuing dance all reinforce without stating a moral. The concept of collective rhythm healing community resonates beyond the literal plot, though one passage edges toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful repetition ("infinitely patient" echoes effectively). The bell tuner's dialogue maintains consistent riddling quality ("Your town stutters"). POV remains stable in limited third, though perceptual signature could be more distinctive—whose consciousness filters these observations isn't always clear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Some elegant turns ("ghost town that had learned to live again") and effective rhythm modulation. However, several phrases edge toward purple ("wild hush that falls when a crowd discovers magic") and there's occasional template cadence in the teaching sequences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The core concept of healing a town through footstep rhythms offers fresh transformation of the "mysterious stranger saves town" trope. Specific details like the ebony tuning fork and spiral dance patterns add originality. The synthesis of physical and metaphysical repair through collective movement feels earned, though some elements (ancient archway, market square) lean on familiar imagery.</comment>
