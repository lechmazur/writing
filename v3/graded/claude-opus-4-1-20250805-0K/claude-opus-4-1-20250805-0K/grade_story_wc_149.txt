<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion through physical details ("fingers found the carved stone bead," "hummed against his chest") and layered internal conflict between love and toxicity. The ghost bride's contradictory nature ("lovingly venomous affection") and Marlow's "mournful elation" create genuine complexity. Minor deduction for the final transformation feeling slightly unearned—the ancestor's need to "let go" arrives without sufficient prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the ghost bride's dissolution transforms both the garden and breaks centuries of bondage, with visible cost in Marlow's tears mixing "salt and liberation." The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the "resonant awakenings" building to release. Strong causality through the bead's breaking and memory transfer, though the mechanism of debt resolution could be clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building with the alchemical greenhouse as micro-setting constraining all action—mercury pools, philosopher's stone soil, and luminescent fruits create a lived-in magical space. The "starless sky" and "winter-cracked fields" pressure the scene temporally and spatially. The bead functions as crucial object-setting that enables the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the bead's increasing pulse matching "a heartbeat that hadn't beaten for centuries" to the greenhouse trembling and fruit brightening. The hundred-year cycle creates temporal pressure forcing tonight's resolution. Cost is legible in both the ghost's protective toxicity that "slowly consumed" and Marlow's final tears, though the transformation mechanism feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "beautiful, venomous love" and debts that bind across generations. The final revelation that "the debt was never mine to pay" reweights all prior material. Strong resonance in the dawn returning after three centuries of darkness, though the ancestor's failure to "let go" arrives somewhat abstractly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice with gothic register ("ashen-veil ghost bride," "ephemeral cameos") and controlled rhythm especially in dialogue. The ghost's speech carries appropriate otherworldliness. Minor issues with register elevation in places ("particular joy of greeting something beloved yet poisonous") that slightly exceed the POV's established range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("fruits pulsed like hearts," "crystalline frost") and good momentum. Some overwriting in metaphor density ("beautiful, venomous love" clusters) and occasional register drift into elevated diction. The final paragraph maintains clarity despite multiple transformations happening simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gothic romance with alchemical worldbuilding creates a distinctive premise. The ghost bride as both protector and poison offers genuine complexity. The hundred-year awakening cycle and inherited talisman debt feel somewhat familiar but are executed with specific detail that elevates beyond template.</comment>
