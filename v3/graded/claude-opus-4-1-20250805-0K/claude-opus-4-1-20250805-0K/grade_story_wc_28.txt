I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered visions and mosaic imagery toward a resonant reconfiguration where Sarai accepts her role as creator rather than restorer.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sarai's contradictory impulses between restoration and transformation act simultaneously throughout, particularly in "My hands were never clean. But mercy isn't about purity." The retrocognitive curse creates genuine internal conflict with visible cost. Minor deduction for the old man serving primarily as exposition vehicle rather than applying pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Sarai shifts from restoring to "creating space for what comes next," with felt cost in her kneeling "retrocognitively trapped but finally free." The accumulative lens holds through vision layers and mosaic assembly. Deduction for slight orientation lag (who Sarai is takes time) and the Brotherhood threat remaining abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tessera and stepping stones constrain choices throughout - each touch triggers visions that force Sarai to confront her past. "The stones remember" crystallizes environment as active participant. The shattered sky and ruined plaza create atmospheric pressure. Minor deduction for generic "ancient plaza" descriptors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal guilt through divine judgment to communal transformation. The tessera placement forcing visions creates consistent pressure. Cost is visible when "learning the shape of aberrant mercy one tessera at a time" shows the price of her nightly compulsion. Deduction for Brotherhood threat never materializing beyond dialogue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between restoration and transformation, culminating in "I'm not restoring anything. I'm creating space for what comes next." The ninety-nine names accepting Sarai as "the Gentle Radical" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through the warm/cold paradox and vision sequences.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent mystical register with controlled rhythm, particularly in "warm despite the frost" and "warm coldness of necessary change." Perceptual signature clear in how Sarai experiences time through objects. Minor dialogue stiffness ("The stones remember") and some filter verb clustering in vision sequences.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the world split open. Not physically—temporally." Some repetitive phrasing around visions ("seized her," "released her") and minor scaffold in exposition passages. "Retrocognitively trapped but finally free" lands effectively. Template cadence in middle vision descriptions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The retrocognitive curse as invitation rather than punishment offers fresh angle on time-loop concepts. Combining mosaic restoration with identity reformation ("renamed them with new identities") creates original synthesis. The "Gentle Radical" paradox and aberrant mercy concept transcend typical redemption arcs.</comment>
