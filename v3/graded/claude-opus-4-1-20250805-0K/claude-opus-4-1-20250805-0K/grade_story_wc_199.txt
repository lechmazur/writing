I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through layered imagery and pattern recognition, culminating in Mira's transformation as she comprehends her purpose.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's transformation from methodical sorter to "translator of the vertical world" is earned through accumulating revelations, with contradictory impulses (report the moonstone vs. build monuments) acting in scene. The final choice to embrace her inheritance carries visible cost—her physical transformation and new burden—though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("the gift of interpretation").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Mira's transformation into keeper/translator, fundamentally altering her relationship to the seeds and arbor with visible cost (physical changes, new burden). The accumulative structure coheres as each discovery builds toward comprehension, though the orientation takes slightly long to establish the skyborne setting's physics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Ashen Skyborne Arbor constrains choices throughout—seeds that sing frequencies, leaves falling upward, roots drinking from clouds all shape Mira's discovery and transformation. The moonstone dust's arrival among the seeds drives the entire narrative arc, and the moss growing wherever she touches becomes embodied consequence of her change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through pattern recognition—moonstone discovery, leaf messages, monument building—forcing Mira's choice between reporting or embracing her grandmother's path. The stakes (trees choosing to ascend further or return to earth) manifest through her personal transformation, with visible cost in her physical changes and new responsibilities.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accumulating particulars—forgotten varieties, tiny monuments, ascending trees—without stating morals. The final image of Mira as "translator of the vertical world" offers a resonant answer to questions of inheritance and purpose, with the moss as living signature reweighting all prior sorting as preparation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains mythic-poetic register consistently ("bridges of bone," "twilight hour when the arbor's ancient bark whispered secrets"), with controlled rhythm that accelerates during transformation. The perceptual signature—noticing frequencies, patterns, forgotten things—is distinctive, though occasional elevated diction ("perpetual hush where past meets prophecy") slightly strains.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful imagery, though some figurative density in peak moments ("bell made of starlight," "fractals of emerald joy") approaches overwriting. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, but phrases like "gravity's rebellious children" edge toward purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of seed-sorting with cosmic mythology feels fresh—seeds humming frequencies that predict blooming, trees refusing to remain earthbound, moonstone dust awakening bloodline gifts. The worldbuilding commits fully to its premise of vertical rebellion, though some elements (Windkeepers' folklore) feel more accumulated than transformed.</comment>
