I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theodore's guilt-driven obsession and the "precision as ethics" philosophy create a compelling, consistent motivation that drives every choice. The internal conflict between his need for absolution and recognition of irreversibility works well. Minor deduction for the village gathering appearing conveniently at the end without prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Theodore's ritual that transforms the clock's precision, with visible cost in his months of obsessive carving and public confession. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through inscriptions and confessions. Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of how speaking names "shifts" the machinery—this borders on magical thinking without sufficient grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge and tower create effective constraints, with the volcanic glass surface and weathered stones providing texture. The pendulum's physical properties (300 pounds, the pause between swings) meaningfully shape Theodore's ritual. Loses points for not fully exploiting the tidal setting's potential to pressure the climactic moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—Theodore's need to restore trust after his failure caused tangible harm. The escalation through confession builds appropriately under the accumulative lens. However, the resolution feels slightly unearned as the village's acceptance comes without dramatized negotiation or resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of "incremental absolution" emerges organically through Theodore's painstaking ritual, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the clock as "the village's collective heartbeat" resonates without overstatement. Strong integration of precision-as-ethics throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with Theodore's obsessive precision reflected in exact counts (1,847 turns, forty seconds). The voice maintains appropriate formality matching Theodore's methodical nature. Some register elevation in the final paragraph ("perpetual redemption, earned through ethical vigilance") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Information density is good, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for the abstract phrasing around the pendulum pause mechanism and occasional overwriting ("dreams that burned with clarity," "marking moments not just of time's passage but of perpetual redemption").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of achieving absolution through microscopic inscriptions on a rake handle offers genuine freshness. The specific harms (fishermen's boats, baker's daughter's wedding, mayor's funeral) ground the abstract concept effectively. The transformation of a clock-winding error into an ethical crisis shows originality.</comment>
