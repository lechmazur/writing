Looking at this story through an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through layered revelations about poisoned legacy, with frost patterns teaching transformation and the final walk into the canyon crystallizing Marina's choice to become someone new.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's transformation from glass artist to someone learning from frost patterns is well-motivated through the revelation about her father's poisoned materials. The decision to let the world believe her dead while walking deeper into the canyon shows genuine internal conflict resolved through embodied action. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "transformation" that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as Marina walks into the canyon, choosing erasure and rebirth over her father's poisoned legacy - the cost of losing her identity is palpable. The accumulative revelations about uranium-infused sand build effectively toward this crystallized moment. Slight weakness in the middle section where reflection dominates over present-frame pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The canyon setting and frost patterns actively constrain and teach Marina, functioning as more than backdrop. The contrast between the destroyed studio and the canyon's natural beauty reinforces the transformation theme. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, though some environmental details in the middle could more directly pressure choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from physical survival after arson to the moral choice of whether to warn others about poisoned materials, culminating in Marina's decision to disappear. The frost's teaching moment provides a meaningful deepening that changes her options. Cost is visible in her willingness to abandon her entire artistic identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of beauty born from poison versus safe transformation emerges organically through the contrast between radioactive glass and frost patterns. The final image of Marina walking toward "someone new being born" resonantly reweights the entire poisoned legacy without stating a moral. Slight abstraction in places prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with selective perception focused on artistic details and material properties. The perceptual signature of an artist noticing patterns and transformations is distinct. Some filter verbs ("she realized," "she thought") slightly dull immediacy in reflection passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition of "transformation" concept and some abstract phrasing ("drifting resonance," "ancient voice") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The uranium-infused glass as source of both beauty and death offers a fresh take on artistic legacy. Marina's choice to learn from frost rather than recreate her father's methods shows non-obvious moral calculus. The piece commits to its premise of dangerous beauty without retreat.</comment>
