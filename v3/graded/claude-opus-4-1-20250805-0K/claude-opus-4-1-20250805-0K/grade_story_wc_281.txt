<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's somatic markers create a distinctive embodied decision-making system, and David's affectionate skepticism generates genuine relational pressure. The transformation from skeptic to "participatory wonder" feels earned through concrete discovery. Deduction for some abstract phrasing around connection and empathy that lacks full embodiment in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Maya's light installation making visible the "invisible architecture of connection," with David's transformation marking the cost of abandoning skepticism. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the final shared illumination. Deduction for somewhat abstract handling of the telepathy concept and FDA recall backstory that doesn't fully integrate with present action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The light painting studio functions as active setting, with projectors and light structures constraining Maya's artistic method. The muscovite's fractal light-splitting properties create specific visual geometry that shapes the revelation. Minor deduction for underutilized pharmaceutical lab setting in backstory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on Maya's need to share her post-accident perception with others, with David's skepticism providing resistance. The crushing of the pill and creation of light corridors marks meaningful escalation. However, the conflict resolves somewhat easily without sufficient cost to David's worldview shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of hidden connections made visible emerges through concrete light structures rather than statement. The "empathy made tangible" line approaches thematic echo but stays grounded in the visual demonstration. Deduction for the overly neat resolution and some abstract philosophizing about human connection that doesn't fully dramatize.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maya's perspective maintains consistency with specialized attention to light and somatic sensation. David's voice distinction comes through his questioning stance. Some filter verb accumulation ("Maya felt," "she explained") dulls immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied syntax, though some abstract phrases like "dendrites of possibility" and "architecture of connection" lean purple. The "willowglass hope" coinage works as character-specific. Deduction for repetitive "hidden pathways" phrasing and some scaffolding around the telepathy explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The somatic navigation system following electric shock offers a fresh angle on enhanced perception. Combining light art with pharmaceutical minerals to visualize connection shows creative synthesis. The premise doesn't fully escape familiar "see the hidden world" templates despite specific details.</comment>
