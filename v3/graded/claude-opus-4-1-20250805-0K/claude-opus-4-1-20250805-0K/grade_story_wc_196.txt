I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through layered discoveries, dust patterns, and archival fragments rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is rooted in concrete specificity—searching for his mother's true story "hidden between bureaucratic lines." His discovery of the button triggers embodied response ("warming in his palm"), and his choice to preserve these "small acts of grace" shows values hierarchy with visible cost (choosing archives over relationships). Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("some wounds required archaeology to heal") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Marcus's recognition that "healing came not from finding the perfect story of love, but from recognizing the imperfect attempts," with visible cost in his lost relationship with Sarah. The accumulative structure coheres as each discovered artifact reweights his understanding. Deduction for slightly abstract resolution that could use more embodied specificity in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dust functions as micro-setting that constrains perception ("reading the accumulation like braille") and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Marcus's archival expertise—he reads dust patterns, feels button weight, sees pencil marginalia others miss. The file room's concrete details (fluorescent light, concrete floor, yellowed folders) create lived-in specificity that shapes his nightly vigil.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding meaning in institutional abandonment—deepens through Marcus's discovery that Timothy returned the button as "a message in a bottle." This reweighting shows how the archives contain not just loss but intentional breadcrumbs. Cost is visible in Marcus's isolation and lost relationship, though the pressure could tighten more dramatically in the middle section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accumulation of "small acts of grace" without stating a moral. The button's journey—from father to son to file and back—embodies how love persists through institutional indifference. The final image of "accumulated silence and careful, tactful hope" offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior archival discoveries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent archival perception ("dust had its own language," "reading the accumulation like braille"). The perceptual signature is distinct—Marcus notices what others overlook (faint pencil notes, dust patterns). Minor deduction for occasional register drift into academic phrasing ("counter-narrative to institutional indifference") that slightly breaks the intimate tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Foster mother: Helen Martinez, widow, three previous long-term placements" efficiently establishes character and experience). Some repetition of "accumulated/accumulation" and abstract phrasing ("repository of society's most vulnerable histories") creates minor drag. The varied paragraph lengths create good visual rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of an emancipated foster child becoming an archivist to search for truth offers fresh specificity. The transformation of bureaucratic marginalia into love letters shows originality. The button as intergenerational message-in-a-bottle avoids cliché through specific detail (brass gone green, Army stationary note).</comment>
