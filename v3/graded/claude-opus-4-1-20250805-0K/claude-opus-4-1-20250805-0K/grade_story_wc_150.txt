I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miriam's internal contradiction between fleeing faith and returning to it plays out through concrete choices—clearing soil, positioning the gnomon, deciding to stay. The transformation from skepticism ("faith had meant nothing more than survival") to cautious acceptance earns its cost through accumulated particulars rather than epiphany. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("cautious enchantment settling into her chest") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the marriage of death/life imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Miriam accepts her role as timekeeper. The cost is legible in "discovering the words her grandmother had left: 'Time returns all wanderers to their purpose'"—she must abandon her twenty-year flight. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. The closure lands with felt cost as she kneels to continue the work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard functions as more than setting—tree roots lifting tombs and growing through ribcages create the physical constraint that shapes Miriam's choice to stay and rebuild. The sundial's placement in this transformed landscape charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("bronze surface green with age," "roots embracing skulls and femurs").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Miriam will reclaim her ancestral role—tightens through the revelation of the sundial's purpose and her grandmother's deliberate waiting. The discovery that "each hour marked by someone who'd left and returned" forecloses her option to leave again. Cost is visible in her commitment to "months" of rebuilding work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the physical marriage of life/death in the orchard-cemetery without direct moralizing until the grandmother's inscription, which reweights all prior wandering. The concept of circular return versus linear diaspora gains complexity through concrete particulars. The final image of "old bones continued their patient conversation with the earth" offers resonant closure without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm that modulates during discovery moments. Perceptual signature emerges in how Miriam notices death-life intersections ("pomegranates splitting against marble angels"). Dialogue between Miriam and Yakov carries subtext about faith and belonging. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in some descriptive passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptive passages that advance both atmosphere and theme. Some figurative density in places ("twisting through gaps in the limestone, their roots embracing skulls") but serves the accumulative pattern. Minor paraphrase loop with "cautious enchantment" appearing twice. Clear propulsion through varied sentence structures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The transformation of a cemetery into a living orchard where death literally feeds life offers fresh treatment of return/diaspora themes. The sundial-as-chronicle device and names-instead-of-numbers innovation feels earned. Risk-taking in the surreal transformation pays off through specificity. Slightly limited by familiar return-to-roots arc, though executed with distinction.</comment>
