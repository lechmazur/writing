I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through sensory memory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the greenhouse transforms into a living memorial.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation through taste-memory gift drives consistent choices, with embodied sensation ("Sweet nostalgia mixed with bitter loss on her tongue") grounding her actions. The final choice to create beauty from ruins is earned through accumulated memory-fragments. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("informally wise") that tells rather than embodies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse transforms into a neural garden that preserves banned memories, with clear cost (twenty years of hiding, risk of discovery). The accumulative lens holds as memories layer through taste, touch, and environmental detail toward the final image. Slight deduction for expository world-building that could be more integrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains and enables: the rusted greenhouse provides both the space for rebellion and the decomposed memories that feed transformation. The triple moonlight's gravitational effect on synaptic plasticity makes the timing essential. Sensory details ("violet sky," "bioluminescent signals") serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from single seed to spreading neural network to transformed greenhouse, with each stage deepening the stakes. The cost is visible in "twenty years" of waiting and the risk inherent in creating something "too beautiful to destroy." One meaningful deepening achieved through the seed's transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of memory-as-garden, resisting the Ministry's forgetting through beauty rather than violence. The final image of visitors leaving "with their own memories reawakened" offers a non-literal answer about how resistance spreads. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit "revolution" framing in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception filtered through Mira's taste-gift ("tasted the memories in the dying leaves"). Rhythm varies appropriately with scene needs. Some filter-verb accumulation ("Mira felt," "she murmured") and occasional register elevation ("synaptic plasticity") slightly above POV's natural lexicon reduce the score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The greenhouse had been her restaurant once"). Some repetitive phrasing around "memories" and "synaptic plasticity" creates minor loops. Template cadence appears in "She had created... She had saved... She tasted" construction patterns that could vary more.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of memory-as-food with neural biology creates a fresh angle on resistance narratives. The specific detail of tasting memories and the greenhouse-as-neural-network transformation feels non-obvious. The gentle rebellion through beauty rather than violence offers genuine originality, though some dystopian elements feel familiar.</comment>
