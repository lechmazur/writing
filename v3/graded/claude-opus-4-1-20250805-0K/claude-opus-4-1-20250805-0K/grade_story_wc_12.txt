<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's contradictory impulses—patience versus urgency, silence versus sound—act simultaneously throughout the exorcism, with his final choice to illuminate rather than cast out earned through the loop-building methodology. The woman's transformation from possessed stillness to clarity carries visible cost in her gasped first breath and the effort of learning to "inhabit her own assumptions."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building layers of looped sound that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration where possession dissolves through examination rather than force. The cost is legible in "the dangerous comfort of never asking why" and the woman's struggle to reclaim agency, with the dimensional anchor providing consistent spatial grounding throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cathedral's acoustics function as active setting, with the loop pedal creating "rooms within rooms of sacred silence" that constrain Marcus's method. The dimensional anchor at the nave's exact center and the stones' resonant frequencies directly shape the exorcism's tactics, making the environment indispensable to the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The seventeen-minute deadline creates genuine pressure while Marcus's deliberate patience ("such things required patience, like teaching stone to remember it was once sand") provides counter-tension. The escalation through layered loops that force the demon to name itself ("I am assumption") demonstrates agency-driven deepening with clear cost in the woman's unraveling possession.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of sound architecture and the demon as "unexamined certainties," with the final image of "decorated silence" reweighting the entire exorcism as illumination rather than expulsion. The palette's indigo transforming into "the color of questions finally asked" offers a non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marcus's perceptual signature—hearing architecture in sound, understanding emptiness as truth—remains distinct throughout, with controlled modulation during the exorcism sequence. The dialogue between Marcus and the possessed woman carries subtext effectively, though some philosophical abstractions ("what assumes that assumption itself cannot be assumed away?") slightly strain naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the loop-building sequences, but some abstract philosophical phrasing ("dimensional anchor," "ordained sequence") occasionally slows momentum. Minor template cadence in the "Marcus + verb" constructions mid-story, though the prose achieves genuine propulsion in the climactic unraveling sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of exorcism through sound loops and rhetorical questioning transforms the possession trope meaningfully, with the demon as "unexamined certainties" offering fresh insight. The specific synthesis of liturgical practice with audio technology creates an inevitable-feeling resolution that couldn't work with different elements.</comment>
