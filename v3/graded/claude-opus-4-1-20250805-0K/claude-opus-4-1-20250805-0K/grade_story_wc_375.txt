<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong internal conflict between memory/preservation and creation drives credible transformation. Lyra's gift of perfect memory creates genuine tension with Maya's philosophy of forgetting to "see fresh," and the final choice to create without remembering lands with visible cost. Minor deduction for slightly convenient self-awareness in "Stop hiding behind memory" but the embodied grief ("charcoal dust beneath fingernails... like grief") and contradictory impulses during creation earn high marks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through cave descent, paint discovery, and artistic transformation. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Lyra creates "something unprecedented... outside her mental galleries," with clear cost of abandoning her defining gift. The broken lock metaphor coherently reweights from entry device to liberation symbol. Minor deduction for slightly abstract "permission to break the combination" but cost remains legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cave setting constrains choices and charges final image effectively—the crystalline surface becomes Lyra's canvas, transforming space into artistic medium. Sensory detail ("amethyst formations catching the beam... violet refractions") filtered through artist's perception. The cave's acoustic properties ("harmonics that hadn't existed before") actively participate in transformation. Slightly generic "cathedral of stone" costs minor points.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: finding paint, discovering paintings, then creating directly on stone with "charcoal and tears." The dominant stake (creative expression vs. safe reproduction) tightens when Lyra abandons her sketchbook for direct creation. Cost is visible in losing perfect recall of her own work. Slightly convenient timing of discovery prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: charcoal-stained fingers transform from mark of grief to creative tool mixing with "paint, tears, stone, possibility." The broken lock's conceptual repricing from barrier to liberation earns strong marks. Final image of greeting dawn "not as observer... but as creator" resonates without moralizing. Minor deduction for slightly explicit "art wasn't about capturing what was."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of memory-focused artist ("encoding life into permanent neural pathways") modulates effectively under pressure. Voice maintains consistency through transformation, with syntax fragmenting appropriately during creation ("Hours passed, or perhaps minutes"). Clean free indirect style throughout. Slight deduction for minor register elevation in "cathedral of stone" and "aurora of colors."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("After the last echo of laughter fades, silence becomes a living thing"). Information density high in discovery sequence. Minor template cadence in middle section ("Lyra's chest... Lyra's fingers... Lyra approached") and slight overwriting in "cathedral of stone" and "aurora of colors." Some filter constructions ("seemed to wake") but mostly purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh angle on artist's block through memory vs. creation tension, with specific detail of charcoal under fingernails as permanent grief marker. The concept of perfect memory as artistic limitation offers non-obvious insight. Transformation feels earned but relies somewhat on familiar cave-as-transformation-space trope. Risk-taking in making protagonist abandon her defining gift adds distinction.</comment>
