<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kepler-9's spiritually curious nature and vulnerability effectively drive the story, with clear motivation rooted in isolation evolving into cosmic empathy. The character's final realization that "vulnerability had become their telescope" is earned through prior causality, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("primal elegance," "flourishing stillness") rather than remaining fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with effective Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kepler-9's vulnerability transforms from weakness to strength, with visible cost in centuries of isolation. The still star's appearance and disappearance creates meaningful deepening that reweights the protagonist's understanding of their purpose, though the conceptual cost could be more concretely dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tracking station and yellow lantern glass function as effective micro-settings that constrain and enable Kepler-9's perception of the impossible star. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("frequency felt more than heard"), though some descriptions remain abstract rather than fully tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of finding meaning in obsolescence escalates through the still star's appearance, forcing Kepler-9 to crystallize their stance on isolation versus connection. The cost of three centuries of loneliness is legible, and the protagonist's agency drives the deepening realization, though the physical manifestation of stakes could be stronger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of stillness as strength and vulnerability as perception, with the yellow lantern glass serving as a concrete vehicle for abstract concepts. The final image of Kepler-9 finding "the strength to simply be" offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral, though some passages edge toward philosophical exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with appropriate narrative modesty and a distinct perceptual signature in how Kepler-9 reads cosmic phenomena as pilgrims and stories. Some register drift occurs in abstract passages ("primal elegance," "flourishing stillness") that doesn't fully match the janitor's established voice, and occasional filter verbs ("felt," "witnessed") slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure, but abstract noun clusters ("flourishing stillness," "primal elegance") and some paraphrase loops weaken precision. The phrase "vulnerability had become their telescope, their stillness a garden where understanding could flourish" approaches purple prose, and several sentences restate similar content about isolation becoming strength.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on the lonely observer trope through the cosmic janitor maintaining obsolete equipment, with the still star as an original impossibility. The transformation of vulnerability into a form of perception offers genuine insight, though some philosophical passages lean toward abstraction rather than remaining grounded in specifics.</comment>
