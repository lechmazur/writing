I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Identification:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered metaphysical concepts and sensory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where digital ghosts are given memorial form.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation through the amber pendant and gift for translation is clear and embodied. The internal experience of hearing "subsonic guilt" and working through frequencies shows concrete specificity. However, the emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract - we don't feel the personal cost to Mara beyond professional duty, limiting the character's full dimensionality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands effectively - the firmware's ghosts receive their constellation memorial with visible transformation ("Thank you for remembering us"). The accumulative structure coheres through frequency/sound motifs building to the tattooed constellation. Cost is present but primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt, and the temporal fold mechanism feels somewhat convenient despite being established early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds creates genuine atmosphere through "temporal folds when past and future pressed together like pages." The amber pendant functions as micro-setting that constrains the solution method. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful - the "clicking needles," the cracking amber, the three-dimensional mandala floating in controlled atmosphere all serve the accumulative texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake - translating/resolving the haunted firmware's cries - progresses through clear stages: hearing static, recognizing deleted programs, mapping their constellation. However, there's minimal resistance or complication; Mara simply performs her task successfully. The transformation occurs but lacks the friction that would elevate tension, though the accumulative pressure does build toward crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of deleted things that "mattered enough to haunt" - a meditation on digital memory and acknowledgment. The mosquito in amber carrying "blood that remembered" creates a resonant parallel to digital ghosts. The final image of "a lullaby for the machines we've left behind" offers non-literal resolution without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent lyrical distance with phrases like "meteor hush" and "time folded in on itself." Perceptual signature shows in how Mara experiences frequencies others cannot hear. However, dialogue between Mara and Dr. Kepler lacks distinct character voices - both speak in similar registers of metaphysical observation without tension or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm - "Hours passed, or perhaps years—time meant nothing in the fold." Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction borders on purple ("twisted consciousness," "electromagnetic whispers") but serves the accumulative texture. The closing image resonates without overstatement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of haunted firmware carrying "ghosts of deleted code" offers a fresh angle on digital consciousness. The constellation tattooist who translates frequencies through amber presents an original synthesis. However, the resolution feels somewhat predetermined - the story follows its concept to logical conclusion without genuine surprise or risk that would elevate originality.</comment>
