I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where anti-light becomes the true beacon.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation crystallizes through concrete embodied details—pressing her palm to feel backward through time, cradling the broken prism with its "fracture lines mapping impossible geometries." Her seventeen-year vigil earns the final choice to trust the shard's sideways vision. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("gravity, pulling events toward this moment") that briefly shifts to diagnostic language rather than staying embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the beacon's transformation from light to "anti-light" fundamentally reweights the premise, with clear cost in seventeen years of isolation. The revelation that ships needed "structured darkness" to navigate home lands with conceptual force. Slight deduction for the final paragraph's explicit thematic statement about "coincidences are conspiracies of light" which over-articulates what the image already conveys.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion functions as both setting and instrument—its harmonics detect the shard's arrival, its walls fragment light into "whispers of color," and its song modulates to guide ships home. The shard of hush becomes essential micro-setting, its "impossibly heavy" silence enabling the prism's healing. Environment directly constrains and enables the central action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from tending a dead beacon to discovering the shard, from touching it to see "sideways" visions, to actively reconfiguring star paths. The cost—seventeen years of solitary maintenance—charges every choice. Minor deduction for the resolution relying partly on the shard's coincidental arrival, though this fits the thematic design about meaningful coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the anti-light that illuminates, the silence that heals fractures, the absence that guides presence. The final image of "thistle seeds on stellar wind" resonates without forcing meaning. Deduction for the explicit moralizing in "coincidences are conspiracies of light" which undermines the subtlety built through imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "frequencies only Mira could properly hear," "shard of hush," "shadows that fell upward." The perceptual signature remains consistent—someone attuned to harmonics and temporal layers. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("inevitable convergences") that briefly exceeds the established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong imagery density with lines doing multiple jobs: "rose like dying stars and never returned" combines action, metaphor, and finality. Some figurative density in peak moments ("darkness so profound it illuminated everything") works thematically but occasionally tips toward overwriting. The prose maintains momentum despite lyrical weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The core innovation—anti-light as navigation beacon—transforms the expected rescue narrative. The shard of hush that heals through silence offers genuine conceptual freshness. The synthesis of retrocognition showing "sideways" rather than backward visions adds originality. Risk-taking in the paradoxical imagery ("shadows that fell upward") heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
