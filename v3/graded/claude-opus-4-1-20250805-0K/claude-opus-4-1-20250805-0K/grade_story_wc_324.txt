<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete sensory details (hearing aid pulses, copper taste), with her persistence driving investigation despite supernatural obstacles. The shift from accidental audiologist to "guardian of vulnerable voices" is earned through specific backstory. Minor deduction for the convenience of her grandmother's device being perfectly attuned to dead frequencies without more grounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and supernatural pulses build toward the revelation of memory theft and Mara's decisive action to recover the stolen voices. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as "seventeen hearts remembered how to speak," showing clear cost (voices stolen) and recovery. The mystery structure maintains causality through tracking clues (SOS pattern, warming photograph, birthday dirge) to basement location.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The atrium's mist and amber light create atmosphere that mirrors the boundary between living and dead, with specific details like "breath through broken teeth" and orchids leaning away establishing uncanny mood. The botanical garden setting provides the liminal space for contact with the dead. Setting actively guides Mara's path through sensory cues (copper taste, thickening mist) toward revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual catatonia to collective "Silence" affecting seventeen residents, with pressure building through supernatural signals (SOS, birthday dirge, fading photograph faces). The tightening occurs when Mara understands the theft mechanism and must act before voices disappear permanently. Cost is visible in the stolen memories/voices and the spreading contagion of forgetting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerable voices being stolen/silenced emerges through concrete imagery rather than statement, with the concept of "incidental heroism" embodied in Mara's reluctant but necessary intervention. The final image of hearts remembering how to speak resonates without moralizing. Subtext operates through the hearing aid's connection to the grandmother and the metaphor of emotional contagions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with distinctive perceptual signature ("mist curled through glass atrium like breath through broken teeth"). POV control is strong with no head-hopping, and the prose modulates effectively between description and urgency. Free indirect style works cleanly when rendering supernatural communication.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("cathedral of suspended gold," "telegraph of terror"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor deduction for slight purple prose tendency in descriptive passages that doesn't quite match the urgency of the situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of tracking emotional contagions through inherited supernatural technology offers fresh angle on ghost story tropes. Specific detail about "contact tracer for hearts" and the mechanism of memory theft creates originality. The synthesis of public health terminology with supernatural investigation feels unique and earned.</comment>
