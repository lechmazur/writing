<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion and internal contradiction, particularly in Vera's gold-sealed face as both wound and art. Mira's shift from clutching the coin desperately to understanding wonder as "seeing beauty in the breaking" is earned through concrete discovery, not epiphany. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("raw materials," "transformation requires accepting the cracks") that edges toward therapy-speak in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the kintsugi metaphor building through concrete images (broken skylights catching moonlight, gold-sealed face, coin's transformation) toward Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira's understanding of her name shifts from burden to invitation. Cost is visible in Vera's scarred face and Mira's acceptance of her own "cracks." Orientation anchors (foundry, post-search party, Mira hiding) establish cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The foundry setting actively constrains and enables—water dripping through skylights, residual heat in iron, the great furnace as transformation site. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (moonlight "like liquid mercury," patterns "like blood vessels"). The coin and Vera's gold-sealed face function as micro-settings that directly shape choices and charge the final image of "wet footprints that caught the light."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mira's struggle with her name's weight) established early and deepens through the coin's transformation sequence. The pressure coheres through Vera's parallel story and the alchemical demonstration, forcing Mira's stance crystallization. Cost is legible in both characters' scars—Vera's literal gold seams, Mira's emotional breaking—though the resolution could push harder against resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kintsugi theme emerges organically through concrete images and actions rather than statements. The coin's physical transformation from smooth to cracked-with-golden-veins perfectly embodies the thematic argument about beauty in breaking. Final image of "wet footprints that caught the light like a constellation" resonantly answers the central question without moralizing, reweighting the entire foundry from tomb to chrysalis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with controlled psychic distance and clean free indirect style. Some register drift into elevated diction ("luminous regret," "chrysalis") that doesn't fully match Vera's established voice. Dialogue carries appropriate subtext and goal-pursuit but occasionally veers toward articulate perfection under stress ("transformation requires accepting the cracks").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting in figurative language ("caught the light like a constellation of their own making"). Minor template cadence in dialogue tags and some elevated register that creates distance. Information density is moderate—most lines advance story or atmosphere but several could do double duty more efficiently.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy and kintsugi philosophy grounded in specific character trauma. The foundry-as-chrysalis transformation and the coin as "measuring device for identity itself" show genuine ingenuity. Risk-taking in the conceptual premise pays off through concrete dramatization, though some elements (distilled intention vial) edge toward convenient magic.</comment>
