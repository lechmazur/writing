<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's transformation from beautician to mortician to hybrid role carries genuine emotional weight, with her calculated movements and "lucidly watchful" consciousness embodying survival under extreme pressure. The final choice to create "eternal almostness" feels earned through her unique dual expertise, though internal contradiction could be more viscerally embodied during the climactic infusion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Mira and the star exist in "eternal almostness." The cost—becoming neither alive nor dead—is legible in "flickering between states," and the persistent constraint of the Silence shapes every tactical choice through "careful, deliberate ways that the Silence couldn't yet detect."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crystallized cloud grotto and aurora function as both setting and constraint, with the aurora providing "the only movement large enough to hide within" that enables Mira's work. The Silence's physical manifestation as "frozen fractals" and "a tide of glass" constrains choices throughout, charging the final image of the "cathedral of frozen aurora."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Silence's upward creep creates coherent escalating pressure, forcing Mira to work faster as "it rose like a tide of glass." The meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers "how to preserve not just beauty, not just death, but the moment between them," with visible cost in their final flickering state between life and stillness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the preservation of thresholds—"the moment between the last heartbeat and the first silence"—without explicit moralizing. The final image of making "death itself beautiful enough to live" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to survival under entropy, though the conceptual weight could be more grounded in physical particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature shows in phrases like "aurora's magnetic breath" and "crystallized cloud," with controlled rhythm that accelerates during the infusion sequence. Some register drift occurs with "preservation spells" and abstract phrases like "spaces between movement and stillness" that momentarily abandon the embodied perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly "The emerald chip began to sing—a sound like light given voice." Minor template cadence in "She had been... Then she became... Now" structure, and some abstract phrasing ("beautiful, terrible sculpture") that could be more concrete, though momentum remains strong through the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of beautician/mortician into someone who preserves thresholds feels non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. The world-building of the Silence consuming motion while the aurora still dances creates a fresh apocalyptic frame, with risk-taking in the lyrical "eternal almostness" ending that heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
