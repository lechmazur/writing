<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Edgar's thirty-seven years of methodical hiding and his careful acts of providence establish clear, consistent motivation. The revelation of collaboration reweights his isolation believably, though the final beat ("Tomorrow, perhaps, she would speak to him again") lacks the embodied cost needed for 8.0+. Internal contradiction between his hunger for connection and fear of visibility plays throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the story builds through layered details of Edgar's caches, memories, and acts of kindness until the archivist's acknowledgment creates a Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost—Edgar's potential emergence from decades of hiding—is implied but not fully embodied on the page. Who/where/when anchored clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The crawl space and pipe chases function as micro-setting that constrains Edgar's existence and shapes his methods of connection. Sensory details (copper pipe coolness, dust motes, ventilation echoes) are selective and POV-filtered. The library's physical architecture enables the story's central dynamic of hidden observation and gift-giving.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Edgar's need for connection versus safety in hiding—faces pressure when the archivist directly acknowledges him. This moment narrows his options but the story ends before he acts on this crystallized choice. Cost is conceptual rather than paid on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of preservation (both of memory and human connection) emerges through concrete actions: Edgar's tape caches, the archivist's rescue operation, their parallel missions. The final image of "careful guardian" reweights their relationship without stating a moral. "Becoming visible wasn't about emerging from the shadows" offers non-literal insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Edgar notices infrastructure, measures silence, tracks movement through ventilation systems. Free indirect style clean throughout ("He understood that particular hunger"). The archivist's brief dialogue carries appropriate subtext and advances the revelation naturally.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose maintains strong momentum with varied syntax and selective detail. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some elevated diction ("ferromagnetic," "constellation of memory") fits the archival context. Minor repetition of "careful/carefully" and template structure in the gifts paragraph slightly dulls precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise of a library hermit discovering parallel preservation work offers a fresh angle on isolation narratives. The specific thirty-seven-year timeline and magnetic tape fragments provide concrete particulars. However, the hidden-benefactor trope and the revelation structure follow familiar patterns without significant transformation.</comment>
