<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to find alternative lighthouse guidance after grandfather's death is clear and embodied through concrete actions like daily grotto visits and glass polishing. The contradiction between her astronomer training and earthbound limitation creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the villagers' too-ready acceptance of her teaching without shown resistance or skepticism.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the sea glass discovery building to community transformation as Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with visible cost (lighthouse failure, grandfather's death) and gained responsibility. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of the fog bank's arrival just as Marina discovers the solution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto functions as active setting that amplifies light and creates the teaching space, directly constraining and enabling Marina's solution. Vivid sensory detail ("salt-slick steps," "liquid starlight") filtered through Marina's astronomer perspective. The grotto's acoustics and limestone formations aren't just described but actively shape the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to community survival as fishing boats need guidance through fog. The glass's activation represents meaningful deepening that changes Marina's options. Cost is legible in the three months of searching and the weight of inherited responsibility, though the resolution comes slightly easy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the grandfather's cryptic words realized in action: "Stars live in more places than the sky." The shift from solitary lighthouse keeper to community teacher resonates without stating morals. The polishing technique bridges gem-craft and star-watching elegantly, though "earthbound star watcher" phrase feels slightly prompt-echoing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with Marina's astronomer lens coloring perception ("liquid starlight," "phosphorescence"). Clean free indirect style during memory sequences. Slight deduction for Tomás's dialogue being perhaps too sparse and the narrative voice occasionally drifting toward explanatory rather than embodied during the teaching sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and effective rhythm modulation. Some figurative density in opening paragraphs ("serpentine," "liquid starlight," "ethereal") without clear payoff. Minor template cadence in the teaching sequence ("Marina showed," "Marina saw," "Marina distributed") detracts from otherwise strong line-level craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of bioluminescent sea glass as lighthouse alternative offers fresh angle on beacon stories. The synthesis of gem-polishing and lighthouse-keeping through circular motions shows originality. However, the community teaching resolution follows somewhat predictable uplifting patterns, and the villagers' instant success with the technique strains credibility.</comment>
