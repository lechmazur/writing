<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kessa's internal journey from believing in separation to understanding braiding shows clear motivation with embodied tension ("fingers trembling"). The transformation is earned through specific failure and discovery, with visible cost in accepting the seed of light. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "possibility" and "presence rather than absence."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Kessa transforms from wall-builder to bridge-weaver, with visible cost in accepting her past failure. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward the conceptual shift. Orientation anchors establish clearly by paragraph two. The closure lands with the seed of light creating genuine change in her role.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Thunder-echo range's "avalanchingly quiet" silence functions as active pressure throughout. Driftwood markers serve dual purpose as navigation and communication. The canyon's thin reality and shimmering air ground the fantastical elements. Setting constrains choice when Kessa must descend to where "reality grew thin."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal failure through discovery to acceptance of a new role. The pressure builds through silence deepening to "presence rather than absence" and the appearance of the Other Place figure. Cost is visible in accepting the seed and transforming her entire understanding. One meaningful deepening that changes knowledge fits the length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the braiding metaphor - not closing/opening but weaving. The error of treating worlds as enemies rather than dance partners resonates without stating a moral. The driftwood markers work as concrete symbol of bidirectional safety. Final image of threshold-as-doorway reweights all prior guardian assumptions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent fantasy-literary register with selective perception ("gilded reed," "gauze"). Some elevated diction feels slightly strained ("avalanchingly quiet," "driven relic keeper"). POV remains stable with clear focalization. The prose modulates appropriately with discovery but occasionally drifts toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("possibility," "presence rather than absence"). Minor template cadence in "She'd returned... She'd discovered..." sequence. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("smoke through gauze," "cupped hands hold water"). Information density is good but occasionally loops conceptually.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The braiding concept offers fresh angle on portal fantasy tropes - worlds as dance partners rather than threats. Specific detail like "gilded reed flute" and "Thunder-echo range" grounds the concept. The reversal from sealing to weaving feels earned. Some familiar fantasy elements prevent higher scoring.</comment>
