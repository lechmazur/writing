<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and builds through discovered evidence toward the grandmother connection, with embodied grief ("tears that caught the library's prismatic light") and genuine discovery. The final choice to preserve shadows alongside dreams feels earned through prior causality. However, some interiority edges toward explanatory ("knowing that some dreams take generations to bloom") rather than fully embodied, and the transformation from observer to active preserver could use more visible internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught shadow migration building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira understands her purpose as dream-tender. Closure lands with felt cost through "luminous regret for all the years her grandmother had waited" and the weight of generational responsibility. The shadow's metamorphosis into the grandmother's preserved dream creates legitimate before/after stakes. Minor deduction for some expository passages that summarize rather than dramatize the shadow's journey.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming library's glass petals and dream-sharing chambers create a vivid futuristic setting that enables the story's premise. The river stone functions as micro-setting, constraining choices across timelines and charging the final image. Sensory details like "walls that hummed with stored memories" and "rainbow patterns across her workspace" are selective and purposeful. The setting evolution from 2024 hospital to 2084 library traces coherently through the footage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the shadow's purpose—deepens through frame-by-frame discovery, with meaningful tightening when Mira realizes it followed the stone across decades. The shadow's metamorphosis into the grandmother's dream creates genuine escalation. Cost becomes visible through Mira's tears and acceptance of generational responsibility. However, the conflict lacks external pressure or resistance; Mira's colleagues' dismissal is mentioned but never dramatized as active opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the shadow's patient preservation of hope across time, with the river stone as a concrete anchor for abstract concepts. The final image of Mira tending dreams "through the waiting darkness" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. The concept of dreams taking generations to bloom arises from specific events rather than assertion. Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated "hope itself could metamorphose" which edges toward thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with purposeful compression and lyric touches ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer," "blooming library spread its glass petals"). The POV remains stable in close third, with controlled psychic distance that tightens during the vision sequence. Perceptual signature shows through selective attention to light and shadow. Some register elevation in peak moments ("luminous regret," "softly deliberate grace") fits the story's tone but occasionally feels reaching.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. Information density is high, with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. However, template cadence appears in the shadow-tracking sequence ("In the 2024 recording... By 2054... Now Mira understood"), and some phrases edge toward purple ("eternal dusk deepened into colors that had no names"). The modifier "softly deliberate" appears twice, creating minor repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of shadows as vessels for unfulfilled dreams offers fresh perspective on familiar themes of legacy and memory. The specific synthesis of dream-sharing technology with intergenerational hope feels non-obvious yet inevitable. The transformation of surveillance footage into emotional archaeology is particularly original. Some elements feel slightly derivative (the blooming library as obvious metaphor), but the overall vision coheres as singular.</comment>
