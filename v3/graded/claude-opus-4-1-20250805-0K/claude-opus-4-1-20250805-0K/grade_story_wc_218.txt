<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's terminal diagnosis creates authentic urgency that drives every choice, with her acceptance of death as "appointment" rather than sentence showing genuine complexity. The internal contradiction between her scientific precision and mystical acceptance plays out through concrete actions (wrapping copper wire, documenting patterns). Minor deduction for the predecessor's convenient identical condition feeling slightly orchestrated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens builds through copper wire connections, electromagnetic patterns, and geological memories toward a Conceptual Repricing where death becomes translation rather than ending. The cost is legible in "Six months wasn't a death sentence -- it was an appointment" with the price of mortality reframed as necessary sacrifice. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two with who/where/when established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The copper wire network constrains every choice Mira makes, transforming from installation tool to translation medium that enables the final revelation. Living stone pillars that "hummed with energy" and roots growing through volcanic formations create a setting where architecture itself participates in the closure. The orchard as "interspecies council chamber" elevates setting beyond backdrop to active participant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from groundskeeping job to preventing resort development to mediating interspecies communication, with each copper connection deepening Mira's understanding. The tightening occurs when she realizes "what needed remodeling wasn't the temple, but human perception itself." Cost is visible in her acceptance that dying at the "correct frequency" is her purpose, though the resort threat feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image of copper wire as translation medium, avoiding abstraction about communication or death. The final insight that "understanding would come" through "slow collaboration of wood and stone, mediated by those wise enough to die into translation" reweights the entire narrative without moralizing. The recurring botanical diary and copper network create resonance without forced symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice emerges through technical precision ("electromagnetic pulses," "mathematical patterns") filtered through mystical acceptance. Some register drift occurs with phrases like "interspecies respect" and "symbiotic partnerships" that feel more academic than character-driven. The perceptual signature of someone seeing death as technical specification ("dying at the correct frequency") is memorable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "diagnosis had arrived like salt spray on a windless day." Template cadence appears in the middle section with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions. Information density is high when describing the copper network's function, though some passages lean toward exposition ("The trees had been trying to communicate for centuries"). No major clarity issues at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise of death creating the exact electromagnetic signature for interspecies translation offers a fresh angle on both terminal illness and environmental communication. However, the convenient alignment of all caretakers having the same condition and the trees' patience feeling somewhat derivative of eco-fiction tropes limits full originality. The specific use of copper wire as translation medium shows genuine invention.</comment>
