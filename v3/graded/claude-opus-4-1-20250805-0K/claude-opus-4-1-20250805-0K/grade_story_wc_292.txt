<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy, with concrete embodied details like pressing the copper nail "between her thumb and forefinger." The internal conflict between "idealistic certainty wavering only slightly" and "spongey dread" creates genuine tension. However, the final choice to broadcast coordinates lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate to higher bands—the decision feels predetermined rather than torn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: nail discovery leads to map revelation leads to understanding the protocol leads to broadcasting coordinates. Closure lands as a Decisive Change when Elara broadcasts the coordinates, transforming from passive researcher to active rescuer with visible cost ("weight of inherited responsibility"). The orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words. Deduction of -0.4 for slightly mechanical progression that could use more friction between discovery beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The weather station setting actively constrains choices through the approaching hurricane and provides tools (holographic map table, satellites) that enable discovery. Sensory details like "waterlogged pages reeked of brine and decay" are selective and purposeful. The copper nail functions as micro-setting that constrains the key choice. Missing higher bands because environmental pressure could more directly shape Elara's tactical decisions in the middle section.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal discovery to saving forgotten populations, with the hurricane creating real-time pressure. The revelation about Lydia's true mission meaningfully tightens options, forcing Elara to act before evacuation. However, the cost remains somewhat abstract—"weight of inherited responsibility" lacks the visceral price that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of "reversible exile"—those saved must remain ghosts to protect their saviors. The copper nail accumulates meaning from coffin fixture to navigational key to inheritance of responsibility. The ending reweights prior material effectively, showing how official histories erase inconvenient truths. Slight deduction for the somewhat explicit thematic statement about "official records couldn't acknowledge."]</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent academic-explorer register with selective perception focused on maritime/archival details fitting Elara's profession. The POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Dialogue between Elara and Hayward carries naturalistic subtext about their shared nervously confident energy. The perceptual signature is distinct in how Elara notices magnetic patterns and navigational details others would miss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with good momentum and varied sentence structures. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs like "The experimental weather station hummed around her, its instruments tracking the new jet stream patterns that had redrawn the world's coastlines three years ago." Some filter verb clustering ("Elara saw," "understanding finally") and occasional overwriting in metaphorical language ("spongey dread...pressed against her ribs like wet wool") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The core concept of using storm systems to mask rescue routes and copper nails as magnetic keys offers fresh angles on familiar exile/rescue narratives. The integration of climate change with historical maritime secrets creates organic originality. However, the resolution feels somewhat safe—broadcasting coordinates is the expected choice rather than a bold risk that would elevate the score.</comment>
