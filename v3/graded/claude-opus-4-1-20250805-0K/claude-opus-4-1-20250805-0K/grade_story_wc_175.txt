I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than causal plot mechanics, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where temporary creation honors erasure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation emerges clearly through embodied detail—weathered fingers pressing moth scales, three-day climb, deliberate knotting patterns. The final choice to create beauty that won't last is earned through accumulated texture about the cloud dwellers' philosophy. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("overlooked histories persisted in margins") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure: Mira honors the cloud dwellers by creating temporary structures that dissolve, embodying their civilization's values with visible cost (her three-day journey, careful work erased). The accumulative lens holds consistently as patterns of impermanence build toward the final image. The monarch's death carrying forward memory provides clear conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The verdant grotto functions as more than setting—it constrains choices (accessible only by climbing, moisture dissolves structures) and charges the final image through its own temporary nature. Vivid sensory work: "mosses draped like curtains," "water droplets seemed to pause mid-fall, creating prisms." The setting's impermanence mirrors and enables the story's central action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative deepening: from moth wing examination to structure-building to monarch arrival to dissolution. The dominant stake (honoring erased histories through temporary creation) tightens when the monarch reads the moth scales, then departs carrying knowledge it won't survive to deliver. Cost is visible but could be more visceral in the moment of creation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars without moralizing. The final image of Mira's descent leaving "only the faintest trace" offers a non-literal answer to questions about memory and erasure. The interrupted cadence pattern (tight knot, loose knot, absence) becomes both literal structure and thematic resonance, reweighting the entire piece.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through Mira's esoteric knowledge—reading atmospheric currents, understanding moth-scale messages. Some register drift into elevated literary diction ("transiently rooted," "systematic erasure") that occasionally distances from immediate experience. Voice maintains consistency but lacks the rhythmic variation that would heighten pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("orange wings like torn sunset"). Template cadence appears in parallel structures ("creating beauty...creating prisms...creating invisible knots") and some paraphrase loops around impermanence themes. Information density is good but uneven—the middle section about cloud dwellers contains more telling than the embodied opening and closing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of migration narrative with civilizational erasure through the specific lens of temporary art. The moth-scale message system and aerial garden civilization avoid cliché. The core insight—honoring the forgotten by creating something beautiful that won't last—feels earned rather than imposed, though execution occasionally relies on familiar literary patterns.</comment>
