Looking at this story through an Accumulative/Textural lens, where meaning builds through layered imagery and the ice-pattern motif that transforms from damage to growth.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kira's transformation from wounded engineer to moss gardener shows clear motivation through embodied details like "silenced it without looking" and the proffered cutting gesture. The backstory about harassment integrates smoothly (~15%) and directly motivates her present sanctuary-building. Minor deduction for Marcus's somewhat convenient appearance and quick acceptance, though his request to learn provides adequate cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the ice-pattern metaphor ("Where things freeze and thaw, they leave marks. But those marks can become the richest soil") with visible cost in Kira's three-year transformation. The accumulative structure coheres as moss imagery deepens from decoration to meaning-system. Slight deduction for Marcus's arrival feeling mechanically timed, though it enables the teaching moment that crystallizes the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The server room setting constrains and enables perfectly—dead tech infrastructure literally supports new growth, cooling systems channel rainwater. The ice-pattern on moss creates the story's central metaphor and physical cutting that transfers meaning. Sensory details like "whisper of air through vents" and "honeyed hush" establish atmosphere while the transformed space embodies theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from personal (viral exposure) to relational (Marcus's guilt) to philosophical (converting witnesses to gardeners). The ice-pattern discovery provides the accumulative turn that reweights prior damage. However, Marcus poses no real opposition or complication—his immediate acceptance reduces potential friction that could have heightened the transformation's cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the ice-pattern metaphor without stating its moral. The grandmother's amber pendant and three generations of women's different languages (quilts/gardens/moss) add resonant depth. The final image of "converting witnesses into gardeners, one proffered cutting at a time" offers a non-literal answer to trauma that avoids both vengeance and passive acceptance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with selective perception ("emerald and jade," "honeyed hush"). Dialogue feels natural with appropriate subtext—Marcus's "I'm sorry I never—" carries weight. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in final paragraph ("quiet revolution of moss and meaning") that pushes toward writerly without quite breaking character perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some mild overwriting in the final paragraph ("viral... outlast any headline") creates slight redundancy. The ice-pattern description and moss cultivation details maintain concrete specificity throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The server-room-as-garden premise offers fresh transformation of tech-decay. The ice-pattern discovery provides genuine surprise that retrospectively feels inevitable. However, the harassment-backstory-goes-viral frame uses familiar territory, and Marcus's role as sole believer follows expected patterns without meaningful subversion.</comment>
