I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where pattern recognition and density increase drive toward a Conceptual Repricing closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Yann's precognitive curse creates genuine internal tension through the "trapped between knowing and doing" paradox, and her final choice to create patterns for future apprentices shows earned progression. The embodied detail of "star dust warm against her hip" and concrete actions ground the character well, though some interior passages drift toward abstract philosophizing rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Conceptual Repricing closure lands effectively—Yann's understanding that she's "seeing through time's new transparency" reweights the entire premise with clear cost (living each moment twice). The accumulative structure coheres through pattern-building toward revelation. However, the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually stated, and some middle passages meander without tightening pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The frictionless world concept brilliantly constrains every action, from eel movement to the very nature of time. The tidal bluff setting actively participates through the stone pattern ritual, and sensory details like "aurora writhed above...like living serpents" create vivid atmosphere. The star dust functions as both object and constraint, warming and responding to the configuration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding what the eels truly are—develops through pattern-building pressure, with the stone arrangement creating tangible escalation. The precognitive curse provides consistent internal conflict. However, the middle section lacks a decisive tightening moment; the revelation arrives somewhat smoothly rather than through earned struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of hidden knowledge and transitional states emerges organically through the frictionless world metaphor. The grandmother's promise creates meaningful subtext, and the final image of Yann creating patterns for future apprentices resonates thematically. Some passages edge toward explicit theme statements ("The frictionless world wasn't broken—it was returning"), slightly undermining subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains distinctive texture through phrases like "borrowed dawn" and "spaces between what moves and what remains." POV control is strong, with Yann's precognitive perception coloring descriptions consistently. The prose modulates effectively between lyrical description and grounded action, though occasional drift into elevated register ("cosmic dust," "eternal dance") doesn't fully match the herder perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic variety and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. However, some paraphrase loops appear ("knowing what would happen had never meant controlling it" restates the earlier curse description), and phrases like "ancient creatures" and "eternal dance" lean generic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frictionless world premise is genuinely original, transforming physics into narrative constraint. The synthesis of eel herding, precognition, and cosmic transition creates fresh territory. The risk of combining hard SF concepts with mystical elements pays off through specific grounding, and the stone pattern ritual offers unexpected resolution to the grandmother's promise.</comment>
