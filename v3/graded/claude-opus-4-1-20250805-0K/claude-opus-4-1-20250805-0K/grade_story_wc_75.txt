<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marta's motivation to preserve cultural memory is clear and embodied through concrete actions like tracing initials with charcoal. The "fierce tenderness of the archivist" emerges naturally from her grandmother's opera glass lens and the urgency of melting walls. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "dread" that could be more physically embodied, though the rosewater scent partially grounds it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear accumulative/textural lens with density increase toward closure as Marta discovers the bakery alcove's hidden notations. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with cost—the walls literally weeping away history while Marta races to document. The "ending properly documented could become a beginning" provides conceptual repricing with visible urgency. Minor deduction for Henrik's warning feeling slightly disconnected from the main arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The grotto behind the waterfall creates genuine constraint—the thawing ice both reveals and destroys. The emerald lens transforms walls into readable palimpsests, making the opera glass essential to Marta's choices. The bakery alcove with its bread-initial prints provides stunning specificity that charges the final image of "transforming loss into legacy."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through environmental pressure—from quiet exploration to frantic documentation as "droplets began forming on the ceiling." The rosewater scent signals imminent destruction, forcing Marta's urgent choice between sections. Cost is visible but could be sharper; we see her working frantically but miss a specific sacrifice of what she must abandon.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the bread initials as "resistance against erasure" without explicit moralizing. The opera glass lens becomes a perfect metaphor for transforming perspective on loss. The final image of "transforming loss into legacy" resonates without stating a thesis, though Henrik's subplot slightly dilutes focus.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature through Marta's curatorial eye noting "faded frescoes," "palimpsest of memory," and specific bread-initial descriptions. The voice maintains consistent historical-archival register with touches like "alphabet of belonging." Minor deduction for occasional elevation into abstraction ("tomb of culture") that slightly exceeds the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the ovens stood cold now, but the walls bore the pressed prints." Some elevated diction ("palimpsest," "irreversible weeping") fits the museum guide's voice. Deduction for abstract phrases like "fierce tenderness" and "tomb of culture rather than its sanctuary" that slow momentum, plus minor repetition of "dread" and "displacement" concepts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The bread initials as cultural preservation method is genuinely fresh—"K for Katarin, who sang the harvest songs." The opera glass revealing hidden pigments offers an original take on memory and perspective. The grotto as both sanctuary and tomb avoids simple refuge narratives, though the beekeeper element feels slightly grafted.</comment>
