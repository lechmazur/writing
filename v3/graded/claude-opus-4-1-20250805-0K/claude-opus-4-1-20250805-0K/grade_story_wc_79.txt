<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's quietly driven nature manifests through concrete actions—mapping spirals, translating patterns, choosing to follow despite warnings—with clear internal contradiction between fear and the need to understand. The final choice to enter the hatch despite the city's protective rust carries visible cost as she leaves safety while the turtles begin to wake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern discoveries layer toward the crystallized moment of Mira slipping through the hatch while turtles wake and watchers turn. Closure achieves Charged Poise—options and stakes are legible (stay safe/seek truth) with felt cost as the geological groan signals immediate danger. The spiral pattern language creates coherent throughline from shells to watchers to message.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The city built on turtle shells constrains every choice—from the rusted gate forcing use of the maintenance hatch to the spiral patterns teaching Mira the language needed to read the warnings. Setting actively shapes the final image as "the deep, geological groan of the first turtle beginning to move" transforms home into threat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through pattern accumulation: whistle silence → crack discovery → message translation → watchers turning → turtles waking. Each revelation narrows Mira's options from investigation to urgent escape/pursuit choice. The cost is legible as she leaves the only known safety while the foundation literally shifts beneath the city.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between protective stasis (rusted gate, sleeping turtles) and dangerous knowledge (spiral patterns, watcher messages). The final image of Mira mapping "whatever came next" while her world transforms resonates without stating a moral about curiosity versus safety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through Mira's cartographer's eye—spirals, patterns, angles of gazes. Voice maintains consistency through "salt-thick air," "calcified stairs," "geological groan" while modulating effectively from methodical observation to fevered translation work.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines like "The shells' natural spirals had always guided her work—their mathematical perfection teaching her the pattern languages that made sense of this strange world." Strong rhythm variation and zero loops, though occasional filter verbs ("felt wrong," "felt heavy") slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of sleeping turtle-cities with stone watchers as warnings creates a genuinely fresh worldbuilding concept. The inversion of safety (city as trap) and danger (truth as necessity) transforms familiar quest narrative through specific details like reed whistle acoustics and spiral mathematics. Risk-taking in the ambiguous ending heightens stakes (+0.3).</comment>
