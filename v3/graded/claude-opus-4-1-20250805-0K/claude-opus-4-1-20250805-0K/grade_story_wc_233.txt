<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Seraphina's progression from disenchanted queen to accepting her cursed transformation shows clear internal conflict and embodied cost, particularly in "she felt the familiar rage that had driven her from her throne." The final choice to become a firefly-guardian is earned through the grotto's ultimatum and her understanding of the inherited debt, though the transformation itself could use more visceral resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with bleeding starlight motif building through dreams, physical manifestation, and final transformation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Seraphina becomes a firefly-queen, with clear cost ("her human form dissolved"). The cyclical structure with the sleeping princess reinforces the curse's continuation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto's blue-black pulsing stone and ember crystals of "frozen fire" create vivid, purposeful setting that constrains choice—Seraphina must climb here specifically to confront her bloodline's debt. The bleeding starlight seeping through stone provides both atmospheric tension and plot mechanism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal dreams to kingdom's survival ("Then your kingdom falls tonight, taking every soul with it"), forcing Seraphina's transformation. The grotto's ultimatum provides clear pressure, though the middle section could tighten—the revelation about the great-grandmother's bargain arrives through exposition rather than embodied discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of inherited debt and cyclical sacrifice emerges organically through the transformation of queens into firefly-guardians. The final image of the young princess beginning to dream effectively reweights the opening without stating a moral, showing how power's price transfers across generations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled imagery like "silk drawn across broken glass" and "roses bloomed backwards into buds." Some register elevation in places ("monuments to some ancient burning") slightly strains the POV's natural diction, but the perceptual signature remains consistent through Seraphina's transformation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The path wound through dying gardens where roses bloomed backwards into buds"). Minor repetition of "bleeding starlight" and some elevated diction ("crystalline, sharp") that occasionally distances rather than immerses. The transformation sequence maintains momentum despite abstract elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of queens transforming into firefly-guardians to maintain a curse offers fresh mythology, particularly the specific detail of "roses bloomed backwards." The cyclical structure and inherited magical debt avoid generic fantasy tropes through concrete costs and the grotto's personality.</comment>
