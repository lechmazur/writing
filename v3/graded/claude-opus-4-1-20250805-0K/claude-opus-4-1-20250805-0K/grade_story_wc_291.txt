I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds meaning through layered portrait-making and pattern recognition rather than strict causal turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sarah's prosopagnosia creates a compelling contradiction—a portrait artist who cannot recognize faces—and her methodical compensation through texture and pattern feels authentic. The internal logic of seeking "wholeness through others' divisions" drives credible choices, though the killer's psychology arrives somewhat abstractly in the final third.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works as Sarah builds seventeen portraits that reveal a pattern, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration when the composite reveals the killer's fractured identity. The cost is conceptual—"dangerous unity" sought through murder—though the killer's specific identity and capture remain off-page, slightly weakening closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quarry's limestone walls, morning mist, and "intersection of sight lines" create atmospheric pressure that enables Sarah's unique investigative method. The scarlet ribbon fragment provides crucial tactile information, and the setting's "deepest corners" revealing as mist lifts parallels the investigation's clarity emerging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes accumulate through each portrait revealing victims' dual nature—"generous hands emerging from clenched fists"—building toward the recognition that these weren't random killings but "reunions." The pressure deepens rather than reverses, appropriate for the textural lens, though the killer's specific threat remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of fractured identity seeking "dangerous unity" emerges organically through the portrait-making process. "We are all divided selves seeking dangerous unity" resonates without moralizing, and the masks revealing rather than hiding duality inverts expectations meaningfully.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sarah's perceptual signature—mapping through "texture and movement," seeing "angles between shadow and bone"—creates distinctive voice. The prose modulates from methodical observation to urgent realization, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("lancing through private vice like light through prisms").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, but several overwrought metaphors strain clarity: "silence felt complete now, holding truth like cupped hands holding water." Template phrasing appears in the victim descriptions ("victim number one...victim two"), and abstract formulations like "architecture of a shattered mind" reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of a face-blind detective solving murders through portrait-drawing offers genuine freshness. The inversion of masks revealing rather than hiding identity and victims as "reunions" provides non-obvious insight, though the psychiatric professional angle feels somewhat familiar.</comment>
