I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered sonic imagery, ancestral memory, and vibrational patterns toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira dissolves into sound itself.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's transformation from engineer to living frequency is earned through concrete embodied details ("feeling her larynx adjust microscopically," "could see her own bones through translucent skin"). The contradictory impulses between preservation duty and personal dissolution act simultaneously in the vault scene. Minor deduction for the grandmother's teachings feeling slightly convenient, but the final choice to become sound rather than keeper lands with visible cost—her humanity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira's dissolution into the lighthouse frequencies creates a before/after with clear cost (her physical form). The accumulative build through sonic layers ("whispered prayers," "fundamental frequency," "perfect resonance") coheres at closure. Orientation anchors (lighthouse engineer, drift-ice marina, Arctic) establish by ~80 words. The protective covenant and artifact's necessity are dramatized through consequence rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina functions as both setting and constraint—the "ever-shifting ice floes" and "spring melt fracturing protective barriers" create urgency. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("frozen metal door," "honey and blood" sunset). The vault's suspension field and bioluminescent patterns ground the fantastical elements. Setting directly shapes the choice through the lighthouse network's dependence on the artifact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine maintenance to species-level covenant through accumulative pressure. The Collectors' arrival creates a ticking clock ("Time was running short"). Mira's agency drives the resolution—she chooses dissolution over preservation. The cost is visceral: losing human form to become "a living wave." One meaningful deepening occurs when the artifact's removal would "silence every lighthouse from here to Greenland."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and transformation, crystallizing in "not its keeper but its voice." The sonic absolution concept deepens from forgiveness to "becoming sound itself." The final image of Mira as "a shimmer of blue against gold" offers a non-literal answer about sacrifice and adaptation. Subtext operates through the grandmother's untold death and the "covenant" with ice itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled technical vocabulary ("sonic absolution," "vibrational matching," "fundamental frequency"). The perceptual signature focuses on vibration and resonance throughout. Minor inconsistency in register when switching between poetic ("whispered prayers") and technical modes, but the modulation serves the accumulative build. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and rhythmic control. Information density is high—most sentences advance both plot and atmosphere. Some figurative density in peak beats ("wings of forgotten birds," "honey and blood") but serves the accumulative pattern. Minor template cadence in middle section ("She understood... She pressed... She descended") but recovers for closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a lighthouse engineer becoming living sound offers a fresh angle on sacrifice narratives. Specific synthesis of Arctic setting, sonic technology, and ancestral knowledge creates originality. The "compressed sound from the first lighthouse" and humans who "remembered how to speak with the ice" transform familiar guardian tropes. Risk-taking in the dissolution ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
