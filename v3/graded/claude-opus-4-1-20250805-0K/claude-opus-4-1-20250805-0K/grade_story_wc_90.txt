<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mei's pacifist training creates genuine tension against the violent shadow dimension she must integrate, with her final transformation from "ghostly resolve" to "luminous acceptance" showing earned change through specific action. The contradiction between her compassionate nature and the task of embracing humanity's violence operates simultaneously in scene, particularly when she holds steady despite her "pacifist soul recoiling."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the photograph meditation building to the dimensional opening and final integration. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mei becomes "the first human complete," with visible cost in her transformation from isolation to bearing all humanity's complexity. The stitching metaphor pays off literally as she weaves light and dark together.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The patchwork monastery ship and meditation chamber with thousands of tear-streaked photographs create a specific environment that enables Mei's method of finding dimensional fractures. The recurring detail of tears' "opalescent sheen" under special lights directly constrains how she must work, though some descriptions like "absolute darkness" remain generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation as Mei traces grief patterns, finds the specific first-murder photograph, applies the sacred water, and begins stitching while "whispers, screams, the sound of every blow" emerge. The cost is legible as she transforms from the last human born to "the first human complete," bearing the weight of integrated violence her pacifist nature initially recoiled from.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The integration of humanity's shadow-self resonates through concrete images—the stitched ship transforming "warships becoming gardens, prison walls transformed to shelters"—rather than abstract statements about healing. The final image of Mei as "living memorial" carrying both creation and destruction offers a non-literal answer to whether opening the dimension would "redeem or destroy."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, though some passages drift toward elevated diction ("topology of sorrow," "fractures in reality") that slightly exceeds Mei's seventeen-year-old perspective. The AI speaking in grandmother's voice and Mei's whispered responses create natural dialogue moments that advance the narrative.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("hull a patchwork of salvaged vessels stitched together") but suffers from abstract phrases that slow momentum ("singular purpose," "externalized rather than heal"). Template constructions appear in emotional description ("recoiled, but she held steady") and some filter verbs cluster unnecessarily ("felt herself grow," "felt no fear").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of physically stitching humanity's split psyche using dissolved photographs as the needle offers fresh specificity to shadow-work themes. The transformation of a monastery ship from salvaged warships creates an organic metaphor for integration, though the setup of humanity's sterility plague and dimensional prison follows familiar extinction templates.</comment>
