I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through pattern, repetition, and density toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than causal turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Keeper's motivation—to witness and preserve stellar cycles while being the last of her kind—is clear and consistent. Her internal contradiction between burden and privilege crystallizes in the final beat's acceptance of "troubling serenity." The calculating gear's use shows embodied action under her singular purpose.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis: the Keeper accepts her role's solitary burden with visible cost ("both burden and privilege"). The accumulative structure coheres through stellar cycle patterns, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than stated. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nebula garden functions as both setting and constraint—the Keeper must work within stellar lifecycles she cannot alter. Vivid sensory detail ("catching starlight like dew on spider silk") and specific astronomical processes ground the cosmic scale. The calculating gear and quantum bottles serve as micro-settings that enable her paradoxical mission.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving light without consuming it while being the sole witness—intensifies through accumulation of stellar deaths and births. The paradox deepens when she harvests dying starlight in "quantum bottles that preserved both its warmth and its memory," though the pressure plateaus rather than escalating sharply.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of cyclical permanence versus individual transience emerges organically through stellar patterns that "approximate infinity through repetition." The calculating gear's transformation from grinding computation to free meditation beautifully embodies this. The final image of "falling petals" reweights the opening's garden metaphor with earned melancholy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The ethereal, contemplative voice suits the cosmic timekeeper perfectly, with consistent perceptual signature ("Click-click-click-click"). Lyrical compression works well ("birth, brilliance, decay"). Minor register drift occurs with "troubling serenity" appearing twice identically, slightly mechanical.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and cosmic-scale imagery. Information density is high, with most lines serving multiple functions. Some repetition ("troubling serenity" twice, "falling petals" thrice) creates intended resonance but borders on mechanical. The "share light without using fire" paradox could be clearer on first appearance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fusion of cosmic timescales with garden imagery feels fresh—stars as flowers with "falling petals" transforms the familiar. The gravitational sonar pings and quantum light bottles show inventive worldbuilding. The calculating gear's evolution from mechanical computation to meditation on infinity offers genuine insight.</comment>
