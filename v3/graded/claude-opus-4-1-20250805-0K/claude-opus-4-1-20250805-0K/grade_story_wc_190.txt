I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to transform passengers through understanding silence is clear and rooted in his own past trauma. The woman's progression from rigid panic to peaceful acceptance feels earned through concrete sensory work. Internal contradictions between seeking/fearing silence operate throughout, though the resolution arrives slightly too smoothly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the terraces' acoustic properties building to the woman's transformation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she finds peace in the train whistle's fade, with emotional cost visible in her journey from panic to acceptance. The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2, though the transformation's speed strains credibility slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prism terraces create a unique sensory environment where each platform's acoustic properties (Ruby absorbing whispers, Sapphire amplifying heartbeats) constrain Marcus's navigation choices. The storm glass vial functions as micro-setting that responds to atmospheric changes and guides his decisions. Setting directly shapes the resolution through the Opal Arch's three-second delay creating the transformative echo.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—helping the woman find comfort in silence—escalates through Marcus's careful navigation of increasingly challenging acoustic zones. Pressure coheres through the terraces' shifting harmonic frequencies responding to her distress, forcing Marcus to adapt his route. The cost appears in her transformation from fleeing noise to accepting it, though the single-beat resolution lacks deeper complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox that "silence isn't absence but presence without intrusion," developed through concrete acoustic experiences rather than stated philosophy. The train whistle's transformation from sharp intrusion to lullaby embodies the thematic journey. The ending's "architecture of silence" metaphor resonates without moralizing, though relies somewhat heavily on Marcus's explicit wisdom-sharing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marcus's perceptual signature focuses on acoustic subtleties and atmospheric pressure changes others can't feel, creating a distinct professional expertise. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("Too loud" completing her thought about silence). The narrative distance remains stable in close third, with syntax appropriately slowing during contemplative moments and tightening during navigation sequences.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between action and reflection. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. Some figurative language borders on overwriting ("crystalline spans," "suspended city of glass and silence") and occasional filter phrases ("Marcus knew," "Marcus recognized") dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of acoustic terraces that reshape rather than remove sound offers a fresh angle on silence/noise dynamics. The specific properties of each platform (Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald) create an original world-logic. The transformation from "fleeing noise" to "learning which sounds deserve attention" provides genuine insight, though the guide-as-healer archetype is somewhat familiar.</comment>
