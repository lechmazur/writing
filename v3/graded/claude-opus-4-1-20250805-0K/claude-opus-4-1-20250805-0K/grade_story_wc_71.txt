<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to understand the "small wrongnesses" drives consistent action through observation and investigation, with her final offering representing earned understanding rather than epiphany. The piece excels at embodied perception ("the active presence of quiet, burning away the day's accumulated noise") and her choice to place the orris root shard costs her a family heirloom while enabling future sanctification.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pattern recognition through displaced objects toward Marina's understanding that houses learn to hold absence. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Marina places the shard as offering, with visible cost (losing grandmother's heirloom) and conceptual cost (accepting grief's transformation of place). Who/where/when anchors clearly by paragraph two.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bay functions as more than setting—its "held breath" quality and role as "repository of hush" constrains Marina's understanding and enables her final choice. Sensory detail filters through Marina's particular attention ("liminal hour when sensors couldn't decide") and the crystallized orris root serves as both tool and constraint for perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why objects migrate and houses feel alive—deepens through Marina's pattern recognition to revelation about grief transforming place. Escalation occurs through accumulation: individual displacements → pattern recognition → understanding through the shard → choosing to participate, with the cost of surrendering her grandmother's artifact clearly legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars without stating its thesis: grief and love alter the molecular structure of place until walls learn to embrace. The orris root as "crystallized hush itself" and the bay as "repository" create resonant non-literal answers to how absence and presence coexist. The final image of the bay "cradling its displaced treasures like prayers" reweights all prior displacements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm that modulates with discovery ("This wasn't silence—it was the active presence of quiet"). Marina's perceptual signature shapes every observation through her cataloguing consciousness. Minor register elevation in final paragraph doesn't break POV but slightly strains naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("streetlights flickered between waking and sleeping—that liminal hour"). Some elevated diction in peak moments ("sanctifying themselves," "molecular structure") creates mild register drift. No loops or scaffolding, strong syntactic variety, though "inadvertently profound" appears without full integration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of houses learning to hold absence through displaced objects offers fresh angle on grief and place. Specific synthesis of perfume fragment as crystallized quiet that enables perception transforms expected ghost story into something more nuanced. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure heightens meaning without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
