<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marla's internal journey from fragmented self-judgment to understanding her role as "ferryman of forgiveness" shows clear motivation with embodied details like "bow trembling against strings." The transformation is earned through specific experience, though the hitchhiker remains more symbolic than fully realized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marla's understanding of her true role, with visible cost in confronting "all the versions of herself she'd refused to forgive." The accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns build toward revelation, though the fantastical elements strain causality slightly when the hitchhiker materializes from music.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mountain pullout and bridge settings effectively constrain choices and enable the musical transportation concept. Vivid sensory details like "scaffold wrap flutters" creating notation systems show originality, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("amber air of approaching evening").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal mystery to cosmic responsibility as Marla discovers her role in granting "pixelated amnesty." The cost is visible in confronting her fragmented selves, though the resolution relies heavily on revelation rather than active choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of forgiveness through art emerges organically from the bridge-song concept and pixelated photograph metaphor. The final image of Marla playing "for whoever might be listening from their own pixelated prison of regret" resonates without stating a moral, effectively reweighting the opening's mystery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marla's perceptual signature as someone who reads "mountain winds like sheet music" creates a distinct voice with lyrical control. The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, though some passages drift toward overwriting ("luminous disbelief in her chest").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "dissolved like morning frost," but overwriting appears in phrases like "sculpting possibility from the ashes of 'never.'" Some metaphor density in high-pressure beats ("doorways," "seeds," "luminous disbelief") creates mild congestion without pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bridge-song fiddler who unknowingly transports souls between possibilities offers genuine originality. The wet-plate photograph showing "pixelated amnesty" as fractured self-forgiveness transforms familiar elements into something fresh and emotionally specific.</comment>
