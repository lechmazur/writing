<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margot's transformation from isolated ledger-keeper to community participant is earned through concrete discovery and choice, with internal contradiction between her shrewd business sense and unnamed longing. The final image of her finding "her place in the eternal exchange" carries visible cost—abandoning pure calculation for uncertain compassion. Minor deduction for Martha's emotional processing feeling slightly rushed in their meeting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the story builds through layered discoveries (envelope → locket → Martha's identity → teaching legacy) that reweight Margot's understanding of value beyond "careful calculations." Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Margot accepts her role in "cycles of compassion," with cost visible in her shift from broker of goods to "broker" of human connection. The mistaken address causally enables everything while the library's roofless nature charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The roofless library under stars becomes a living constraint—volunteers must replace tarps, books need weatherproofing, teaching happens "by lantern light." Setting actively shapes choices: the open-air structure enables community continuation after Samuel's death and charges the final image of "thousands of volumes reaching toward constellations." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from harbor to library to island.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity (nightly library visits) through moral obligation (delivering the locket) to community transformation (securing donated books, enabling teaching). The dominant stake—whether silent contributions matter—tightens when Margot must choose between simple delivery versus deeper engagement. Cost is visible in her transformation from "tallying manifests while others waltzed" to active participation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the mistaken address, Samuel's anonymous teaching, Martha's navigation lessons, all embodying how "knowledge passed hand to hand, often without thanks." The final image of Margot smiling at "whispers like symphony notes across the water" offers a non-literal answer about value beyond ledgers. The locket photo's "eyes blazing with determination" returns transformed in Martha's teaching and Margot's new role.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Margot's perceptual signature filters everything through commerce—"tallying manifests," "broker," "personal cargo," "currencies beyond calculations"—until this lens expands to include human exchange. Prose rhythm accelerates during discoveries and slows for reflection, supporting emotional beats. Minor deduction for occasional filter-verb clustering ("she discovered," "she initiated") that could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs: "The outdoor concert had drawn half the port town, but she'd watched from her window" establishes character, setting, and isolation simultaneously. Some paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "cycles of compassion"/"eternal exchange" and the explanation of Samuel's work gets restated. The closing image effectively recharges earlier motifs despite these redundancies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mistaken address as friendship catalyst offers a fresh angle on connection-through-error, avoiding tidy resolution by revealing the siblings' estrangement. The roofless library is memorably specific, not a generic setting. However, the "cycles of compassion" theme and Margot's transformation follow somewhat predictable patterns once the setup is established.</comment>
