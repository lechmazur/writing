I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered discoveries and sensory detail toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lyra's limitation becomes her unique sight.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyra's prosopagnosia drives every choice, from her selection for this commission to her method of creating with light rather than traditional media. The final realization that "some things could only be seen by those who couldn't see" earns its weight through prior tactile discoveries. Minor deduction for the scholar's somewhat convenient wisdom at the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lyra's disability becomes her unique ability to preserve what others cannot see, with clear cost in the library's imminent destruction. The accumulative structure coheres perfectly as each discovery (coin, faces, light patterns) builds toward her transcendent understanding. The "sky inside walls" motif pays off beautifully in both literal light-work and metaphorical preservation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The hollowed oak library constrains every choice—from the specific placement of mirrors through carved shelves to the moonlight gaps that enable Lyra's light-portrait. Touch becomes setting through Lyra's fingers reading carved grooves and coin indentations. The demolition countdown creates inexorable pressure that shapes her working method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through the three-hour deadline, each discovery deepening stakes: finding the coin, understanding its spiral of faces, realizing the library's true purpose, then crafting something that transcends physical preservation. The cost lands viscerally as "first demolition machines rumbled closer" while Lyra walks away carrying an internalized sky.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the coin's layered faces become human continuity, Lyra's blindness to faces becomes ability to feel truth, the library's destruction becomes preservation through memory and light. The final image of "carrying the sky inside her own walls" reweights every prior element without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyra's perceptual signature is distinct—experiencing the world through touch, reading "like braille," understanding "structure through alternative senses." The prose modulates effectively from crystalline stillness to urgent discovery. Minor deduction for the scholar's dialogue trending slightly generic against Lyra's rich interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in passages like "moonbeams through the hollow trunk's carefully placed gaps." Some elevated diction in peak moments ("fractally precise," "prosopagnosia") fits the scholarly setting. Minor repetition of "truth" and occasional filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of blindness-as-sight with the demolition of a living library offers genuine freshness. The coin as a spiral map of faces rather than places, and light-portraits replacing traditional art, transform expected elements. Risk-taking in making the protagonist's disability her unique qualification pays off (+0.3).</comment>
