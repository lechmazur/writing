I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This operates as a **Causal** story - Marcus's discovery of his role in his daughter's death leads to hiring the Arbiter, whose revelations about simplicity vs. complexity reframe his understanding, culminating in his choice to embrace moral nuance.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation crystallizes through the hollow mirror shard and his daughter's suicide, with clear internal contradiction between wanting absolution and understanding. The Arbiter's detached professionalism creates effective contrast. Minor deduction for "sincerely insincere" and "protected vulnerability" reading as authorial labels rather than fully embodied states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: daughter's absolutist morality → discovery of father's practices → suicide → Marcus seeks understanding → Arbiter reveals the fatal simplicity. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Marcus faces his choice to "grow into complexity or shrink from it" with visible cost. Deduction for cost being more conceptual than visceral in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lighthouse setting anchored immediately with "October wind" and dawn light creating atmosphere. Wind chimes function as more than decoration - they reveal backstory and constrain the Arbiter's knowledge-gathering method. The hollow mirror shard gains meaning through the lighthouse beam. Setting doesn't fully constrain the climactic choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Central stake (understanding daughter's death) established early and deepens when revealed as Marcus's own culpability in raising her on "absolute morality." The reversal that he killed her with simplicity, not complexity, reframes everything. Cost remains somewhat abstract - "terrible gift of seeing clearly" lacks visceral weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of moral complexity vs. absolutism emerges organically through the daughter's tragedy and Marcus's reckoning. "Children raised on absolute morality break when they discover the world's true colors" resonates without preaching. The hollow mirror reflecting "gray spaces between what we intend and what we do" effectively crystallizes the theme through image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled distance and philosophical register fitting an "Arbiter." Dialogue carries subtext effectively - Marcus's "sincerely insincere" tone, the Arbiter's clinical detachment. Strong perceptual signature in phrases like "expensive doubt" and "designer uncertainty." Minor repetition in "simple/simply" cluster weakens impact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Information density high in passages like the wind chimes revealing backstory. Some overwriting: "absolute but dawn threatens the horizon" strains; "terrible gift of seeing clearly in the fog" edges toward purple. Template phrases like "behind me" and "either way" in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh take on the "conscience for hire" concept with the Arbiter as temporary replacement examining moral complexity. The hollow mirror shard as physical manifestation of shattered self-image shows originality. Execution of familiar parent-child tragedy elevated through specific moral framework about simplicity vs. complexity.</comment>
