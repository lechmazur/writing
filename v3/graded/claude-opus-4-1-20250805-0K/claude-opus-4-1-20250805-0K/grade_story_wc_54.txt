I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This story operates under a **Causal** lens - Maya's discovery leads to understanding, which enables action, which reveals meaning. Each beat follows because/therefore linkage as she decodes the terminal's hidden purpose.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's engineering curiosity drives consistent, motivated choices throughout. Her progression from skeptical investigator to awed discoverer feels earned through concrete actions. The "stoic wonder" characterization lands effectively in her methodical yet reverent approach to the discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from discovery to understanding to resurrection, with clear cost (decades of abandonment, lost knowledge). The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Maya becomes a "navigator" herself, though the final paragraphs edge toward over-explanation. Who/where/when anchored immediately.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal setting directly constrains and enables Maya's choices - the carnival debris leads to the sextant discovery, the hydraulic infrastructure becomes the puzzle itself. Vivid sensory details ("rust flaked away," "bronze piece") ground the fantastical concept. The setting literally IS the story's mechanism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from academic curiosity to existential discovery about human aspiration. The pressure builds through Maya's physical work and intellectual breakthroughs. However, lacks external opposition or meaningful risk beyond intellectual failure - the discovery comes too easily once she begins.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of "infrastructure carrying dreams" emerges organically through the hydraulic metaphor. The sextant-as-key resonates well. However, lines like "proof that infrastructure could carry dreams" and "equations for hope" explicitly state what the story already demonstrates, diminishing subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with engineering-minded perception ("parabolas," "pressure differential"). Voice maintains technical precision balanced with wonder. Some register elevation in philosophical moments ("mechanics of human intention") slightly strains the established voice but doesn't break it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied syntax and strong verb choices. Information density high in discovery sequences. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "functionally creative" (3x) and some conceptual loops ("hope could be engineered"/"equations for hope"). The extended philosophical summary in final paragraphs drags momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering and existential philosophy through the spaceport-as-instrument concept. The idea that infrastructure encodes human aspiration offers genuine originality. Transformation of abandoned space into living calculator transcends typical "lost knowledge" tropes.</comment>
