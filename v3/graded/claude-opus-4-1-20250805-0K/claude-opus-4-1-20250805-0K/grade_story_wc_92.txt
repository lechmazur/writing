<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thorne's vigilant watching translates into tactical knowledge (knowing every stone's position) that enables action, and his internal stakes around nurturing change show genuine contradiction. The collaboration with Amara adds relationship pressure that tests loyalties. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "freedom" and "justice" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the sundial's coded angles building toward distributed rebellion. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the quill holder placement crystallizing the revolutionary network, and cost is visible in the risk both sentinels take. The "cradle of sparks" concept effectively shifts from abstract to concrete method.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sundial's painted/unpainted angles constrain communication paths and the bronze quill holder's engravings carry forbidden knowledge, both shaping tactical choices. Fort architecture (towers, courtyard, gates) creates spatial pressure. The twilight-to-dawn timeframe adds urgency to the signal timing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal vigilance to coordinated revolution through the blackout opportunity. The sundial revelation deepens pressure by showing the network's extent. Cost is legible in both characters risking their positions, though the distributed nature of consequences could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of quiet revolution through accumulated small acts emerges organically from the sundial's coded system and "death by a thousand paper cuts" strategy. The bronze/shadow imagery and "cradle of sparks" concept coherently explore how change ignites without violence. Final image of the quill holder returning to innocence while carrying revolutionary purpose resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formality befitting Thorne's sentinel role, with selective perception focused on security details and hidden meanings. Dialogue between Thorne and Amara carries subtext effectively. Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("luminous fort's sandstone walls like captured fire") slightly strains the POV's watchman perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum through the courtyard sequence. Information density is high with details serving multiple purposes. Minor issues with some elevated diction ("accumulated small rebellions," "orchestrated through bronze and shadow") and occasional abstract phrasing that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The sundial as communication device through painted angles offers fresh specificity, and "death by a thousand paper cuts" through bureaucratic resistance is inventive. The concept of revolution through whispers and misfiled documents transforms expected rebellion tropes, though some revolutionary rhetoric feels familiar.</comment>
