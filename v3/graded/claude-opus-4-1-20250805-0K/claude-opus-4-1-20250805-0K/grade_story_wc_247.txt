<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's contradictory impulses—needing to create despite loss, photographing without film—act simultaneously in scene, particularly in her compulsive clicking of the empty camera. The final choice to recognize silence as "a beginning rather than an end" carries visible emotional cost earned through forty years of struggle, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("joyful sorrow").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered gestures, empty photographs, and mapped silences until the final "visual symphony" reweights Maya's loss as creative transformation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost—forty years of isolation transformed into "something equally beautiful." Minor orientation delay (Maya's deafness revealed late) doesn't harm closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The harbor's "spilled mercury" moonlight and dawn's gold paint create vivid sensory hierarchy filtered through Maya's visual-only perception. The empty camera constrains her artistic expression throughout, charging the final image of "footprints and the echo of gestures." However, the harbor remains somewhat generic despite luminous description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation reads as accumulative deepening: Maya's solitary ritual → Chen's recognition of the "symphony in negative space" → collaborative translation → acceptance of silence as beginning. The cost is legible in "forty years" of forgotten work and isolation, though pressure could tighten more sharply between beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of "mapping silence"—translation not as restoration but transformation into "something equally beautiful." The final image of gestures that "sang without sound" offers a non-literal answer to loss without moralizing, reweighting prior despair as creative possibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Maya experiences the world through visual music—"Listen with your eyes," framing "silence through its viewfinder." Sign language dialogue creates unique texture. Minor wobble in register when narration explains Maya's historical significance rather than embodying it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("The harbor glowed like spilled mercury") with good rhythm variation. However, some redundancy appears ("forgotten melodies could be seen rather than heard" closely echoes earlier concepts) and occasional overwriting ("quietly charismatic presence that drew people without sound—a gravitational pull").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise of translating sign language into symphonies, then mapping silence through empty photographs offers genuine freshness. However, the "accident" that erases both hearing and world memory feels convenient, and some metaphors ("spilled mercury," "luminous") lean toward familiar poetic territory.</comment>
