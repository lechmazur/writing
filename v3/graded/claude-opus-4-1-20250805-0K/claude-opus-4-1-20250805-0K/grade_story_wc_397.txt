I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through the ice marina's breaking songs, the parasol tip's recurring presence, and Marlene's transformation from seeking death to finding purpose in witnessing endings. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - Marlene's choice to remain and witness rather than end creates visible cost.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marlene's transformation from euthanasia tourist to witness of endings is earned through concrete experience, with the parasol tip serving as a physical anchor for her internal state. The contradiction between seeking death and finding purpose in helping others evacuate shows genuine complexity, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("fold in patience") rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - Marlene's transformation from seeking her own ending to "finding in that sound not death but transformation" reweights the entire premise with visible cost. The accumulative structure coheres through the ice's breaking songs and her evolving relationship to endings, with the parasol tip threading through as a persistent constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina functions as both literal setting and metaphorical landscape, with the ice's various breaking sounds creating a sensory hierarchy that mirrors Marlene's internal state. The minus-forty air, thermal sensors, and calving ice constrain choices and create urgency, though some descriptions lean abstract ("frozen cemetery").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake - Marlene's relationship with endings - deepens through her vigil at the marina, with the ice's progressive breaking creating natural escalation. The cost is visible in her choice to remain rather than seek another ending, though the conflict could benefit from more immediate pressure beyond observation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of transformation versus ending emerges organically through the ice's music and Marlene's evolution, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of "two voices learning the harmony of endings that refuse to end" offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency with some lovely moments ("each crack in the frozen marina played a different note"), but occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains against the POV ("windborne solace," "beautiful disaster"). The dialogue feels natural and carries subtext, particularly the grandmother's "The ice holds until it doesn't."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows control with varied sentence rhythms and strong imagery, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("temporary headstone marking where the sea refused to die completely") and abstract phrasing ("fold in patience"). Some metaphors strain credibility, and there's mild repetition around "endings" that borders on thematic echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of euthanasia tourism with Arctic ice rescue creates an unexpected angle on mortality, with the parallel between Marlene's failed suicide and the ice's slow collapse offering fresh resonance. The piece commits to its premise without retreat, though some elements feel slightly derivative of climate fiction tropes.</comment>
