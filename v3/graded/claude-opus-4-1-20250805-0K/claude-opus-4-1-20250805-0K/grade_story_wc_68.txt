<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is clear and rooted in his obsessive pursuit of truth after three years of isolation, with his internal conflict between solitude and potential collaboration earning the closure. The woman historian shows complexity as someone playing both sides. Minor deduction for some abstract philosophizing ("Truth isn't democratic") that could be more embodied, though the final choice to collaborate despite mistrust lands with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkage: Marcus intercepts reports → confrontation → revelation of shared purpose → collaboration decision. The closure (Decisive Change from isolation to partnership) lands with visible cost as Marcus abandons his solitary stance. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient alignment of their goals, though the "heavier than water-soaked leather" metaphor effectively charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken city setting constrains choices through physical navigation (sewer tunnels, flooded plaza) and provides the sedimentary layers central to the conflict. Strong sensory work with "barnacles creep across marble statues through green-tinted water." The waterproof case and diving gear ground the post-apocalyptic reality. Setting directly shapes the final descent "deeper into the ruins" as both literal and metaphorical movement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving truth vs. comfortable lies) escalates through revelation that the historian shares Marcus's goal but uses different methods. The cog serves as concrete evidence that tightens the conflict. Cost is visible in Marcus's "carefully maintained composure crack[ing]" and his acceptance of collaborative deception. One meaningful turn when the historian reveals her true purpose, forcing Marcus to choose between isolation and strategic alliance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of competing historical narratives emerges through concrete conflict over the cog's dating and the plague's true nature. The chronometer metaphor ("doesn't just tell time—it tells you where you are") resonates beyond plot mechanics. The final image of descending to where "real history waited in patient chronological defiance" offers a non-literal answer about truth requiring both preservation and strategic patience. Minor deduction for slightly over-explicit thematic statements in dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus's voice maintains "abrasive calm" consistently, with distinct perceptual signature in how he notices decay and interprets artifacts. Dialogue carries subtext effectively, especially the historian's gradual revelation. Some register elevation in philosophical statements ("Truth isn't democratic," "rational rebellion") slightly exceeds the established voice. The woman's speech distinguishes adequately from Marcus's, though her voice could be more distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some philosophical abstractions slow peak beats ("developing philosophies no one would hear, preserving truths no one wanted"). Strong specific images like "barnacles creep across marble statues." Minor template cadence in the middle section with repetitive "Marcus [verb]" constructions. The final metaphor of sediment settling into proper layers effectively charges the closure without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on post-apocalyptic narrative through the specific focus on historiography and archaeological deception. The twist that both characters are preserving different versions of truth for different audiences adds complexity. The self-destruction of technology to prevent spread rather than plague destruction offers non-obvious moral calculus. Specific details like the chronometer cog and sedimentary dating methods ground the originality in concrete particulars.</comment>
