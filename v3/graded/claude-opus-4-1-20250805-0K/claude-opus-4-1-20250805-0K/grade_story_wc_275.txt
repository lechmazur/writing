I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor for a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's character shows genuine complexity through embodied contradiction—her "senseless perception" manifests concretely in reading sand shifts and plant responses, while her father's transformation from hunter to learner creates earned change with visible cost. The internal conflict between violence and cultivation drives authentic choices, though some moments edge toward therapy-speak ("teaching them to weave continuity through chaos").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the father learning his daughter's method while "held together by the strange grace of growing things." Cost is visible in his "hollow eyes" transforming to recognition, and the piece maintains coherent causality through the contrast of destruction/cultivation, though the orientation could anchor earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass dome functions as both literal shelter and metaphorical space "between violence," constraining choices and enabling the cultivation work. Sensory detail filters through Mira's professional priorities ("geometric patterns," "coarse fabric"), and the desert setting creates necessary pressure, though some descriptions lean generic ("afternoon sun").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether peace can persist amid violence—escalates through the father's unexpected return and culminates in his learning Mira's method. The cost appears in "exhaustion carved into his weathered face" and the choice to sheathe his weapon, though the conflict could tighten further through more active opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the cultivation metaphor—"engraving peace into the world one bloom at a time"—without explicit moralizing. The final image of family "held together by the strange grace of growing things" offers resonant answer to whether creation can counter destruction, earning its wisdom through concrete particulars rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third POV with distinct perceptual signature—Mira notices plants "lean toward kindness like sunlight" and reads the world for "spaces between violence." Dialogue carries authentic subtext ("The Bennett contract. Complete."), though occasional phrases drift toward elevated register not fully earned by the POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("She possessed what he called a senseless perception"). Some figurative language approaches oversaturation ("prayer made solid," "quiet blaze"), and occasional template constructions appear ("She didn't merely water them; she taught them"), but momentum remains consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of "engraved quiet"—etching stillness into living things—offers fresh angle on pacifism-versus-violence themes. The specific synthesis of bounty hunting and rose cultivation creates non-obvious tension, though some elements feel slightly derivative of post-apocalyptic greenhouse narratives.</comment>
