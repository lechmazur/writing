<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between being "boundary-lessly trapped" yet "absolutely free" creates genuine tension, and her meditation on weights as physical manifestations of emotion shows specific embodiment. The final choice to hold "the weight of weightlessness itself" demonstrates earned stasis with visible cost—she accepts her prison as self-woven.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation ("weights," "burdens," "fractals") building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara recognizes "some prisons we weave ourselves." Cost is visible in the seventeen grams of grandmother's death and the paradox of voluntary imprisonment, though the meditation structure limits causal linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bronze grotto functions as both container and amplifier of Mara's weavings, with its "recursive loops" and "shingled hush" constraining her choices. The kerosene burner's transformation from functional object to weight-anchor charges the final image when it "cooled in her palm," making environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Escalation reads as textural deepening from personal grief (grandmother's seventeen grams) to cosmic weights (mountains dreaming, oceans remembering) to the meta-weight of the grotto itself. The dominant stake—understanding imprisonment through weight-collection—tightens once when she grasps "the weight of weightlessness," though agency remains primarily contemplative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of self-created prisons emerges through accumulated imagery rather than statement, with the whalebone fractals and bronze walls reflecting recursive entrapment. The final image of her father "cleaning burners in an endless loop" resonates as both memory and metaphor for purposeful repetition without understanding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's perceptual signature—seeing weights as measurable geometries—creates a distinct voice through specialized lexicon ("fractal," "recursive," "vertices"). The lyric compression and patterned repetition ("burden," "weight," "weave") serve the accumulative structure, though occasional elevation ("prehistoric patience") slightly strains the meditative register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The bronze grotto exhaled mist where snowmelt trickled through its ancient seams"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("whale ribs, vast and curved, containing spaces that breathed") approaches oversaturation but maintains clarity. Minor template cadence in "The burden of..." construction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of measuring emotional weights in physical grams offers a fresh angle on grief, particularly the specificity of "seventeen grams" for grandmother's death. The synthesis of lighthouse-keeper's daughter becoming fractal weaver feels earned, though the meditation-as-narrative structure follows recognizable literary patterns.</comment>
