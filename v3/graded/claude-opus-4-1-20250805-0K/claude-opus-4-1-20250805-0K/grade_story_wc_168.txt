<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from guilt-ridden to understanding teacher is earned through the porcelain box's accumulated wisdom, with contradictory impulses (refusing/accepting the gift, hiding/sharing truth) acting simultaneously. The final choice to share his vulnerability with his crew carries visible cost ("revealing his own cracks"). Minor deduction for the grandson character existing mainly as catalyst rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the box's meaning deepens through generational history, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marcus transforms from protector to vulnerable teacher. Cost is legible in "revealing his own cracks, letting light pass through them." The six-month gap between receiving and understanding the box slightly dilutes causality but doesn't break it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge path and celestial conjunction create atmospheric pressure for Marcus's revelation, with sensory detail ("moonlight seep through its fractures," "silver roads across the valley"). The porcelain box functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Setting could more actively pressure the decision rather than providing backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from private guilt to the necessity of vulnerable teaching, with the box's generational losses deepening pressure. The transformation from burden to compass ("no longer a burden but a compass") marks clear progression. Cost is visible in Marcus choosing to expose his failures to protect future firefighters.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the kintsugi metaphor—broken things gaining beauty through visible repair—without explicit statement until earned by experience. The final insight about translation ("translate it for those who haven't learned it yet") reweights all prior material. The bargain metaphor ("trading pieces of themselves for wisdom") resonates throughout without becoming heavy-handed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through fire-specific observations ("reading wind patterns in flame," "wisdom written in smoke and char"). Voice modulates effectively from contemplative to urgent when recording the message. Minor register drift in philosophical passages ("violent tenderness," "transmuted into something harder and softer") slightly exceeds Marcus's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("moonlight seep through its fractures") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("violent tenderness," "harder and softer than sorrow"). Template cadence appears in the bargain section ("He'd made...," "Every firefighter made..."). Information density is generally high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The kintsugi tradition freshly applied to firefighter wisdom-transmission offers a non-obvious synthesis. The specific detail of "molten polyester" scarring and the grandmother's three-generation box history ground the universal in the particular. The insight about teaching through vulnerability rather than expertise transforms familiar mentor-student dynamics.</comment>
