<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus's internal conflict between mathematical precision and gut instinct is well-embodied through concrete details like the broken compass and pole-counting system. His trauma manifests believably in changed behavior patterns. The final choice to teach again shows earned growth, though Sarah's character remains somewhat functional rather than fully dimensional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marcus accepting his brokenness while finding new purpose—the utility poles becoming a valid navigation system parallels his internal shift. Causality flows cleanly from trauma through daily rituals to tentative healing. The cost is visible in his permanent loss of traditional navigation abilities and the lives that haunt him.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The utility poles function brilliantly as both literal markers and psychological anchors, constraining Marcus's movements and embodying his reduced world. The coastal setting actively shapes choices—the kayak launch provides daily structure, the fog lifting mirrors internal clarity. Specific pole numbers (7, 12, 19, 23, 31) create a lived-in navigation system that replaces the failed astronomical one.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Marcus can find purpose after catastrophic failure—escalates through his paddle to pole 19 (the rescue launch point) where he confronts his worst memory. The seal's appearance catalyzes genuine laughter, marking a decisive turn. Cost is legible in the 27 lost souls and Marcus's permanent reduction from fleet navigator to kayak instructor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of finding worth in brokenness emerges organically through the parallel between the demagnetized compass and Marcus himself—both unable to perform their original function yet potentially valuable in new ways. The utility poles as "unconventional constellation" resonates without stating a moral. Sarah's presence as fellow griever deepens the exploration of navigating loss with "makeshift tools."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Marcus's perceptual signature shows in how he counts poles obsessively and notices navigation details while missing emotional cues. Sarah's "merrily melancholic" voice is distinctive though her dialogue remains somewhat generic. The prose modulates effectively between technical precision when describing navigation and softer rhythms during emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some phrases edge toward overwriting ("backlash of regrets," "flickering faith evident"). Information density is solid—most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Some repetitive structures appear ("Perhaps... Perhaps..." construction) but don't significantly impede flow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The utility poles as replacement navigation system offers genuine freshness—a mundane infrastructure becoming a personal constellation. The specific trauma (miscalculation killing 27) avoids generic "haunted navigator" tropes. The ending's quiet proposition to teach beginners using poles instead of stars shows authentic transformation of failure into accessible wisdom.</comment>
