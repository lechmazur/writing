<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Margot's transformation from detached investigator to active liberator is earned through the lantern's memories, with clear cost in abandoning her career. The entangled memories create genuine internal conflict between professional duty and ancestral calling. However, Jerome remains more vessel than character, and the supervisor-as-oppressor lacks specificity beyond concept.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Margot's resignation and commitment to preventive intervention, showing clear cost in abandoning security for uncertain purpose. The accumulative/textural lens holds as memories layer to reweight her understanding of prevention. The lantern's magical realism is taught early and pays off at closure, though the mechanism of memory transfer could be more precisely bounded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tunnel setting constrains discovery and provides historical resonance linking past and present liberation. Sensory details like drumming rain and brass worn smooth create atmosphere. However, the modern maintenance tunnel's specifics remain generic, missing opportunities for tools or infrastructure to affect choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from investigating a death to confronting systemic bondage across time, with Margot's career as the price. The accumulation of memories creates pressure that forces her transformation. Yet Jerome's conflict with his supervisor remains told rather than dramatized, weakening the modern parallel to historical slavery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of liberation across eras emerges through concrete particulars—the lantern linking Underground Railroad to modern workplace oppression. Margot's shift from recording to preventing deaths resonates without moralizing. The rain breaking drought parallels breaking spiritual bondage effectively, though the supervisor-as-slaver metaphor risks oversimplification.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent investigative precision that gives way to overwhelm as memories flood through. The controlled professional diction fractures appropriately under supernatural pressure. However, some passages drift into explanatory register ("The empirical observation she'd built her career on") that diminishes immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of resonance ("a heart too full, overwhelmed by the weight") but suffers from repetitive constructions and abstract summaries. Multiple paragraphs begin with "She saw" variations, creating template cadence. The phrase "bondage" appears five times without variation, and several passages tell what could be shown ("slowly eroded Jerome's sense of self").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of Underground Railroad history with modern workplace exploitation offers a non-obvious angle on liberation. The investigator discovering she must prevent rather than record deaths provides fresh perspective. However, the execution relies on familiar magical object tropes, and the workplace oppression lacks the specificity that would elevate the parallel.</comment>
