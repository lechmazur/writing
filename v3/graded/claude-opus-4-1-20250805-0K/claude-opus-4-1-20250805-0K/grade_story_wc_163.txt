<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization as "softly ingenious" manifests through her patient methodology—waiting for patterns to reveal themselves rather than forcing connections. Her final understanding that "some mysteries weren't meant to be solved but inhabited" represents earned wisdom through specific experience with the city's rhythms. Minor deduction for Chen's underdevelopment as functional support rather than pressure source.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the burnt feather triggering a luminous event that Mira witnesses and interprets, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she finds "her place in the eternal conversation." The cost is subtly felt through the dissolution of the feather and the acceptance of mystery over mastery. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly within the opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The underwater research station and drowned city of Thymal create genuine constraint—the glass dome mediates all observation, water filters starlight differently, and the city's coral architectures respond to celestial alignments. The setting directly enables the story's central revelation through "streets that glowed with bacterial light" and "channels carved into bedrock." Environment consistently shapes perception and possibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from observing an anomaly to witnessing the city's awakening to understanding one's place within cosmic cycles. The luminous respite creates genuine tension through its rarity (once every 600 years) and Mira's recognition of her role as witness. Cost manifests in accepting limitation—understanding arrives through inhabitation rather than conquest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between scientific measurement and intuitive understanding, crystallizing in "some mysteries weren't meant to be solved but inhabited." The burnt feather transforms from omen to key to bridge across centuries. The ending's "shadowseam wonder between ocean and ruin" offers resonant synthesis without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent scientific-poetic register with distinctive perceptual signature: "The burnt feather floated...like a dark omen against the bioluminescent algae." Dialogue between Mira and Chen feels natural with appropriate professional subtext. Minor register elevation in places ("shadowseam wonder") slightly exceeds established lexicon but serves closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and information density, particularly in descriptive passages like "schools of fish began gathering, their scales catching and reflecting the glow." Some elevated diction ("captivated them both completely," "ascending souls") occasionally interrupts momentum. Line-level craft supports the accumulative structure through careful image layering.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of a "landscape astrologer" studying underwater ruins that respond to celestial alignments offers fresh synthesis. The specific detail of ceremonial wings that caught fire during ancient rituals demonstrates imaginative reach. The story commits to its concept without retreat, though some elements (fireflies/jellies comparison) trend toward expected imagery.</comment>
