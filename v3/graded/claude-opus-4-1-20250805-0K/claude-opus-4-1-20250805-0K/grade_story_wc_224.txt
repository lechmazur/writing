<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The seer's transformation from oracle to gardener-oracle shows genuine internal conflict between prophecy's burden and her original talent, with the cost of "ten thousand witnessed futures" crushing her past. The final choice to plant rather than seek visions lands with earned renunciation. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around memory and pain that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory memories and the stone's warmth build toward the garden's creation—a Resonant Reconfiguration where buried talents literally grow into healing plants. The cost is visible in decades of blindness and lost self, paid through the transformation. The orientation anchors (mountain bookstore, mercury-glass seer) establish clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mountain's architecture—from "mercury pools scattered throughout" to the soil-filled heart chamber with skylight—constrains the seer's journey and enables the final planting. The bookstore's materiality (leather spines, bark pages, shell scratches) creates lived-in texture. The garden chamber functions as essential setting that makes the transformation possible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from searching for lost self to recovering buried talent to creating something unprecedented—plants that help others remember. The stone's arrival escalates through warmth, memory-return, and dissolution into soil. Cost is legible but the middle section could tighten; some passages feel contemplative rather than pressurized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of buried gardening talent into a living library where "buried gifts could take root." The final image of reading futures in mercury versus growing them from seeds offers resonant contrast without stating a moral. The "hidden thunder" of recognition when visitors find themselves elevates the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through blindness—trailing fingers on spines, feeling stories through bindings, sensing the stone's message "like the texture of a feather." Voice maintains lyric consistency though some passages drift toward elevated register ("thundered in the distance—not sound but possibility"). No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("mercury-glass seer," "books formed walls that spiraled upward"). Some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("when remembering became painful," "permission to plant a future"). Minor repetition of "buried talents" without variation. The final paragraph's rhythm effectively mirrors the garden's growth.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of oracle-librarian-gardener in a mountain bookstore offers fresh specificity, particularly the plants that bloom with inscribed stories. The concept of prophecy through mercury versus growing futures from seeds transforms the seer archetype. Risk-taking in the lyric mode pays off though some elements feel familiar.</comment>
