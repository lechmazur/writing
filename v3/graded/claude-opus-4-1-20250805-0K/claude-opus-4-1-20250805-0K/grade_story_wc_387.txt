<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The net-mender's philosophical interiority is concrete and embodied through specific actions (mending, whistling to fireflies, reading patterns through the whisk), avoiding abstract rumination. Her motivation to understand "hidden patterns" drives consistent micro-choices throughout. Minor deduction for the somewhat declarative insight "beauty existed precisely because someone...had chosen to create it" which edges toward diagnostic self-awareness rather than lived realization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently, building through pattern recognition (nets, firefly paths, moon crescents) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where anonymous acts of care are revealed as world-sustaining architecture. The closure lands with conceptual cost—the erasure of identity in service of continuity. Deduction for slight ambiguity in the middle section where philosophical observations could tighten more directly to the dominant stake of hidden effort.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains and enables choices effectively—the abandoned watchtower provides isolation for observation, the parapet's whispers add texture, and the bamboo whisk becomes a lens for perception. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (rain-scent, humid air, worn stones). The environment actively participates in meaning-making rather than serving as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recognizing and valuing hidden effort—deepens through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens. Tension builds through layered discoveries (firefly patterns, whisk revelations, net geometry) that reweight the protagonist's understanding. The cost is primarily conceptual/philosophical rather than dramatic, which fits but lacks the visceral pressure of higher-scoring work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars—the net-mending, firefly paths, and moon-viewing cohere into a meditation on anonymous labor. The final image of her "ephemeral and essential" passage resonates without stating a moral. Subtext operates effectively through the firefly's "scintillatingly somber rhythm" and the parapet's accumulated whispers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent philosophical-poetic register with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("Moon paths invisible to those who never looked up"). The perceptual signature is distinct—filtering the world through patterns and hidden geometries. Minor deduction for occasional drift toward elevated diction ("demure audacity," "accumulated whispers") that slightly exceeds the character's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is generally high, with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("scintillatingly somber rhythm"), some filter-verb clustering ("She could feel," "she saw," "She recognized"), and mild register drift in philosophical passages that edge toward academic diction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The piece offers a fresh synthesis of labor philosophy through the specific lens of net-mending and pattern-reading. The bamboo whisk as a tool for fractal perception is inventive. The meditation on anonymous effort avoiding sentimentality through concrete grounding in fishing nets and firefly paths shows originality within familiar territory.</comment>
