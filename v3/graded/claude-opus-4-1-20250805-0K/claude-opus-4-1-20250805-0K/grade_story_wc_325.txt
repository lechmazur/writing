<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's claustrophobia creates genuine internal conflict that compounds under water pressure, with embodied fear ("chest tightened," "walls pressing inward") driving micro-choices like forcing herself deeper despite terror. The promise to Marcus provides clear motivation that intensifies through discovery. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("She hated confined spaces—had always hated them") rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (cables as neural pathways, phase transitions, gold flecks) toward Elena's final commitment to annual witness-bearing—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("carrying the memory...like a prayer"). The closure lands with felt weight though the digital cancer revelation feels slightly rushed. Who/where/when anchored clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The flooded station constrains every choice through water pressure, tidal deadline, and claustrophobic corridors that "felt like a throat swallowing her backward." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (amber preservative light, phosphorescent afterimages). The phase chamber's unique properties enable the story's resolution, making environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tidal deadline creates genuine pressure ("forty minutes...currents would make extraction impossible"), forcing Elena deeper despite claustrophobia. The revelation about the digital threat raises stakes retroactively. Cost is visible in Elena's acceptance of annual pilgrimage duty, though the middle section could tighten between discovery and extraction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: gold flecks become "constellations in the flooded dark," cables as humanity's "neural pathways," silence as protection. The final image of Elena carrying memory "like a prayer" while billions remain ignorant reweights the opening's abandonment. Avoids moralizing while exploring witness, sacrifice, and unrecognized guardianship.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with Elena's technical/scientific lens ("sonar rig pinged softly," "phase transition chamber," "phosphorescent afterimages"). Prose rhythm accelerates during extraction sequence. Minor filter verb clusters ("She could see," "She understood") slightly dull immediacy in middle section.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with lines doing multiple jobs ("casting wan yellow pools that made the water look like amber preservative"). Strong opening/closing images. Some paraphrase loops around the phase chamber discovery section and occasional filter verbs reduce immediacy ("Elena forced herself," "She could see").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Phase transition technology as preservation method offers fresh angle on underwater exploration narrative. The concept of encoding messages in water molecules shows ingenuity. Digital cancer feeding on electromagnetic signals is conceptually interesting though execution feels slightly compressed. Gold-flecked journal detail adds specificity.</comment>
