<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by her need to transform trauma into healing through craft. The contradiction between abandonment and return, between danger and creation, plays out through embodied choices like deliberately clearing the workspace amid radioactive debris. However, the couple's arrival feels somewhat convenient, and Marina's therapeutic wisdom ("Safety is not given, it is crafted") edges toward diagnostic speak rather than earned insight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through Marina's ritualistic narration and glass-making until the couple's arrival crystallizes her purpose. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Marina transforms the control room from a space of catastrophic authority into one of vulnerable questioning, with visible cost in the radiation exposure risk. The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Marina, abandoned nuclear plant, March).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The abandoned control room functions as more than backdrop—it constrains Marina's choices through radiation danger, provides the dead monitors as shelves, and the emergency shutdown button as a site for placing spheres about "second chances." The melting ice creates temporal pressure and mirrors the thematic thawing. Sensory details like "breath visible in the March air" and "ice dripped steadily from broken ceiling tiles" are selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—creating safe spaces for dangerous questions in a poisoned place—is signaled early and tightens when the couple arrives, forcing Marina to demonstrate rather than merely craft her philosophy. The cost is legible in the radiation exposure risk and the emotional weight of returning to her father's workplace. However, the escalation relies heavily on accumulation rather than decisive turns, and the couple's immediate trust feels slightly unearned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of transformation through patient craft emerges organically from Marina's glass-making process and self-narration without explicit moralizing. The glass spheres as containers for unspoken questions work as concrete metaphor rather than abstraction. The bookmark subtly links past authority (radiation readings) with present healing. The ending resists tidy resolution, acknowledging that learning to thaw is ongoing work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marina's self-narration creates a distinct perceptual signature—she sees the world through the lens of craft and transformation ("blue at its heart, like hope itself"). The ritualistic commentary maintains consistency while revealing character through what she chooses to narrate. Dialogue is minimal but functional, with the couple's "Is it safe?" carrying appropriate subtext about more than physical danger.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose maintains strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm that mirrors Marina's methodical work. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Some metaphorical language edges toward overwriting ("terrible purpose," "captured suns") but generally serves the accumulative texture. Minor repetition in "Marina + verb" constructions doesn't reach template cadence levels.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of transforming a nuclear disaster site into a space for emotional healing through glassblowing offers genuine freshness. Marina's self-narration as coping mechanism and the glass spheres as question containers feel specific and earned. The story commits fully to its conceptual framework without retreating into safety. However, the therapeutic framework of "safe zones for inquiry" feels slightly derivative of contemporary wellness language.</comment>
