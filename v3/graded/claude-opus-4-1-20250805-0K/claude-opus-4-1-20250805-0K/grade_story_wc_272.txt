<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's internal conflict between seeing fragmented reality and needing to paint coherent portraits drives genuine stakes through embodied contradiction ("fingers trembled," "cracked and luminous with grief"). The transformation from "celebrated portraitist" to someone who embraces "magnificently, necessarily shattered" subjects shows earned change with visible professional cost. Minor deduction for slight therapy-speak ("redesigning herself") in the climactic realization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered reality descriptions building to Marina's reconceptualization of art. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when she realizes "every broken thing was whole in its own dimension," with professional and artistic cost visible in her lost commissions and months of struggle. The lighthouse beam blazing to life crystallizes this shift with felt transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse library setting actively constrains choice through walls "physically closer," books "breathing dust," and the spiral architecture that mirrors Marina's descent into new understanding. Spatial choreography of glass falling upward and walls "opening inward" makes the fragmented reality tangible. The broken tarot box and scattered cards function as micro-setting that enables Marina's breakthrough sketching.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from artistic failure (mayor's daughter portrait) through existential questioning to accepting a new way of seeing with clear professional cost. The walls pressing closer creates physical urgency that forces Marina's decision to "descend into that darkness." One meaningful deepening occurs when she starts sketching on the cards, transforming passive observation into active reconstruction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring question of how to perceive/represent fractured reality, culminating in "Who says darkness isn't another kind of light?" The rhetorical questions build pattern without stating morals, letting Marina's artistic transformation embody the theme. The final image of the lighthouse beam casting "shadows in impossible directions" offers a non-literal answer about multiplicity being truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person with Marina's perceptual signature evident in artistic metaphors ("badly mixed watercolors bleeding," "cubist nightmare"). The rhetorical questions create distinctive voice pattern though some become repetitive. Minor register drift in abstract moments ("magnificently, necessarily shattered") slightly exceeds Marina's established lexicon during peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments of sensory precision ("Glass fell upward, tinkling like chimes") alternate with overwritten passages. Template cadence appears in the rhetorical question pattern (five instances of "What/Why/How" questions). Mixed metaphor of walls both "pressing closer" and "opening inward" creates momentary confusion though it ultimately serves the fragmentation theme. Some paraphrase loops around the concept of broken/fragmented reality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of an artist whose subjects literally fragment combines familiar elements (tortured artist, unreliable reality) in a specific way through Marina's portrait-painting lens. The solution of sketching self-portraits across tarot cards to "untangle" reality shows genuine synthesis. The rhetorical questioning pattern, while occasionally overdone, creates a distinctive philosophical texture.</comment>
