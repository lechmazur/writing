I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inferred: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered discoveries and pattern recognition rather than causal plot turns, culminating in Elara's understanding through accumulated presence and silence.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's methodical curiosity drives consistent choices through restoration work to final understanding. Her progression from guarded professional to "shielded openness" feels earned through specific discoveries. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in the emotional shift ("something more generous") rather than fully embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's palm-press adds her oils to the "invisible record," crystallizing accumulated understanding with clear cost (tomorrow's journey, abandoning traditional cartography). The accumulative lens holds consistently through layered discoveries. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The vault setting actively constrains choices - rain drums rhythm, frescoes peel revealing messages, damaged roof creates specific light patterns. Strong integration of torn map as micro-setting that charges the final image. Slight deduction for generic "moorland" when specificity matters elsewhere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through density increase - from single video to synchronized comparison to UV light revelation to final understanding. The dominant stake (reading unspoken knowledge) deepens through each discovery layer. Cost is legible in Elara's transformation from map-framer to participant in centuries-old conversation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the torn map metaphor - knowledge existing "in the gap between known and unknown." The final image of adding oils to the invisible record resonates without stating its meaning. "Some truths are too fragile for speech" crystallizes the theme through earned wisdom rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Elara reads "hesitations in lines" and "spaces where certainty dissolved." Voice maintains consistent erudition matching her expertise. Some register elevation in philosophical passages ("patient accumulation of human presence") slightly exceeds established voice texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. However, abstract phrasing clusters appear ("fundamental had changed," "wordless invitation," "patient accumulation") and some paraphrase loops ("silent testimony"/"wordless invitation"). Template cadence in "She would find...She would reopen" sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography, restoration, and sacred silence creates unexpected coherence. The concept of mapping through "secretions of human skin" and reading deliberate damage as message shows genuine originality. Transforms the familiar monastery setting through specific professional lens.</comment>
