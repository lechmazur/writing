<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her ritual actions show consistent purpose, though internal contradiction remains mostly implicit rather than dramatized in scene. The mirror-twin moment creates genuine complexity with visible cost as she must collaborate with her inverse self. Emotional progression feels somewhat abstract ("shadowed elation") rather than fully embodied, and the final understanding arrives through exposition rather than earned struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mira's understanding that she guides reality itself, not just ships, with clear cost shown in the mirror-twin collaboration. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual elements build toward the crystallized final image of stars rearranging into truth-constellations. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraphs. Cost is visible but could be more visceral at the moment of transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and glass lantern wick constrain choices through their specific properties—total internal reflection shapes how Mira must channel her power. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (condensed starlight, crystalline geometry, worn groove of stairs). The inverse waters and mirror-ship create spatial complexity that directly affects the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through three increasingly difficult ships, with the third forcing Mira to confront her mirror-self in a moment that redefines her purpose. The dominant stake (navigation between worlds) tightens when she must harmonize with her inverse twin. Cost becomes visible when ancient shadows take shape, though the transformation feels somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of navigation between "what was and what could be," with the lighthouse serving as both literal and metaphysical beacon. The final image of stars spelling truths in unwritten languages offers resonant closure without stating a moral. The concept of steering reality through laughter and storm-summoning creates thematic depth through specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with lyrical, elevated diction appropriate to the otherworldly setting ("harvested over centuries," "dimensions they couldn't perceive"). Perceptual signature is distinct—Mira notices through mystical awareness and ritual precision. Some moments of register elevation ("otherworldly routine," "shadowed elation") feel slightly detached from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong rhythm and imagery with purposeful sentence variety, though occasional abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("something unprecedented," "treacherous waters of becoming"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some metaphysical descriptions edge toward purple prose but remain comprehensible. Minor template cadence appears in the ship descriptions ("One carries... One brings... One steers").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of a lighthouse herald who laughs storms into existence while guiding interdimensional ships offers genuine originality. The mirror-twin sailing inverse waters provides an unexpected turn that feels earned. The synthesis of maritime navigation with reality-steering creates fresh territory, though some mystical elements feel familiar from fantasy conventions.</comment>
