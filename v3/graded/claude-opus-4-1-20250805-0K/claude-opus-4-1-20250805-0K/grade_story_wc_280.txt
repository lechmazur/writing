<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cornelius's synesthetic perception and longing for Isabella create specific, embodied motivation that drives every choice. The internal contradiction between his desire for applause ("honey and copper") and his deeper need for Isabella lands powerfully. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around temporal concepts that could be more grounded in sensory detail.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with echoes building density until Isabella materializes—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (their eternal performance binding). The fractured timeline concept integrates causally as Cornelius uses the coin to weave possibilities. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until paragraph 3 to fully anchor the amphitheater setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mystic orchard with its temporally fractured apple trees and the amphitheater setting directly enable the story's central action—time manipulation through performance. Vivid sensory details like "honey and copper" taste of applause and "purple light and cinnamon warmth" of touch. The setting constrains and enables choices throughout, particularly the coin's power working specifically in this unstable temporal space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal longing to actively manipulating time, with clear cost when Cornelius commits to the eternal performance loop. The dominant stake (reuniting with Isabella) drives every beat, with echoes accumulating pressure. Minor deduction as the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly once Isabella appears—the "happy ending" lacks a sharper edge of sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of echoes creating new realities—art's power to reshape loss into possibility. The final image of two ghosts performing eternally reweights the opening's solitary performance with earned resonance. Slight deduction for the ending's explicit statement about "love returning through fractured time" that could trust the dramatization more.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct voice with synesthetic perception creating unique texture ("tasted honey and copper," "purple edge retreating"). POV remains stable with Cornelius throughout, and the lyrical register fits the theatrical ghost perfectly. Minor deduction for occasional drift into elevated diction ("beautiful wounds") that slightly distances from immediate experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and strong sensory specificity. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for several instances of abstract phrasing ("possibility's sharp mint," "despair's purple edge") and some repetitive structures around the echo concept that create mild loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synesthetic ghost performer manipulating time through theatrical echoes offers a fresh synthesis of familiar elements. The specific detail of performance creating temporal bridges is original. However, the ghost-reuniting-with-lost-love arc follows expected patterns without significant transformation of that core template.</comment>
