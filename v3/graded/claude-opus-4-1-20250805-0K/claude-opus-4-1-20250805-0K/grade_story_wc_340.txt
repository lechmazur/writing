<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority through physical gestures (tracing frost, breath misting) and concrete micro-choices that reveal Mira's patient curiosity. The transformation from servant-observer to inheritor of Thorne's method is earned through accumulated details, though Thorne himself remains more archetype than individual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the elevator's ascent, each floor revealing deeper layers of encoded meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira recognizes herself in Thorne's method—"proof that tenderness survives"—with the cost being her acceptance of isolation's weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The elevator shaft functions as active constraint, its ascending floors creating temporal pressure while frost and ice provide tactile immediacy. The goggles' scratched glass and warm leather constrain perception and enable discovery, making the setting inseparable from the story's mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation as each floor adds urgency to decoding, though the conflict remains primarily internal discovery rather than external pressure. The cost manifests in Mira's recognition that she must "encrypt her own" joy—accepting isolation as the price of preservation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the physical act of decoding—warmth revealing hidden ink becomes metaphor for patient attention revealing preserved joy. The final image of the "patient" elevator reweights the entire ascent as spiritual practice rather than mere duty, avoiding any explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Mira notices technical details with domestic tenderness ("Cloud formation resembles Martha's sleeping face"). Voice maintains controlled distance that mirrors the story's "affectionate detachment," though occasional phrases like "drawn to the tenderness" edge toward telling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong sensory specificity ("ice cracking from cables like breaking bones"), but several abstract constructions weaken momentum: "grief had frozen him solid" lacks embodiment, "beauty within isolation" tells rather than shows. Some filter verbs ("she realized," "she noticed") dull immediacy in middle beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of servant narrative with cryptography—the diary encrypted in star charts and goggles as decoder create non-obvious discovery mechanics. The concept that "only someone who truly looked would find them" transforms the servant-master dynamic into spiritual inheritance.</comment>
