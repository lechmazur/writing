<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's devotion-driven frugality and methodical pursuit create clear motivation, with embodied moments like "trembling fingers" and the physical sensation of knowledge uncloaking. The final choice to seal the covenant carries visible cost (years of isolation, subsistence living) though the immediate emotional complexity could deepen. Internal contradiction between scientific empiricism and mystical belief operates throughout without full simultaneous tension in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer toward the resonant reconfiguration where Mara becomes humanity's bridge to cosmic intelligence. The closure lands with conceptual cost—her "frugal years" purchasing this singular moment of contact. Orientation anchors clearly (Babylon, palace, astronomer) and causality tracks, though the knowledge transfer mechanism ("felt knowledge uncloak itself") edges toward convenience without fuller dramatization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The palace architecture functions as active setting—rooms with "celestial ratios," strategic gaps for starlight, walls as encryption system all constrain and enable Mara's work. Sensory details like stone warming under touch and sub-audible resonance felt in bone ground the mystical elements. The setting literally participates in closure as the palace awakens to complete its beacon function.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to humanity's first contact with cosmic intelligence, with Mara's years of sacrifice establishing cost. The tightening occurs as each discovery (tile location, mathematical key, second tile) narrows options toward the inevitable covenant-sealing. Cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt—we understand but don't fully experience the weight of her isolation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the "empirically ironic" fusion of measurable science and mystical belief, with the palace encoding "deepest beliefs in measurable stone." The final image of mathematical truth as universal language bridging infinite distances offers resonant, non-literal answer to how devotion and understanding merge. No explicit moralizing; the covenant itself embodies the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the material, with selective perception focused on astronomical and architectural details reflecting Mara's expertise. Rhythmic control evident in the building cadences toward revelation. Some filter-verb clustering ("she understood," "she felt") in middle sections slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("starlight filtered through calculated gaps") with strong information density. However, abstract phrasing like "knowledge uncloak itself" and "dimensions orthogonal to time" occasionally obscures concrete action. Minor redundancy in describing the palace's function appears across paragraphs 9-11.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of ancient architecture as cosmic communication device offers fresh angle on first-contact narrative. The specific synthesis of Babylonian astronomy, mathematical mysticism, and patient alien intelligence waiting between measured things feels non-obvious. Transformation of the "last astronomer" trope through frugal devotion adds originality.</comment>
