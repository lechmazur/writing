I'll evaluate this story through the lens of Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and community gathering toward a resonant reconfiguration where the first artist is integrated back into the web of kinship.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kira's boldly sympathetic certainty drives concrete action throughout, from weaving stories into obsidian to organizing the tag search. The first artist's self-exile and return carries genuine emotional weight with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "luminescent ache of belonging" that edges toward label-speak in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the first artist is reintegrated, with visible emotional cost ("tears that caught the lantern light like fallen stars"). The accumulative structure coheres as community bonds strengthen through shared search. Slight deduction for orientation taking until paragraph two to fully anchor the three-month timeline and Kira's role.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor create a vivid, unique setting that constrains Kira's artistic choices (working with volcanic glass and marsh reeds). The crater geography drives the spiral descent to find the artist. However, some descriptions lean ornamental ("pillars of light") without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation as the tag search transforms from individual curiosity to community ritual, culminating in the collective descent. The dominant stake—completing the arbor/finding the artist—tightens when the pattern reveals itself on night seven. Cost is visible but the escalation could be sharper; the discovery feels somewhat convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the image of the incomplete arbor becoming "mirror, reflecting back the faces of all who had searched together." The web metaphor ("You were never outside the web...You were the first thread") resonates without becoming heavy-handed. Final paragraph edges toward explicit thematic statement but remains grounded in scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent third-person limited through Kira with selective, poetic perception ("crystalline orchard trembled with morning light"). Dialogue effectively distinguishes Tomás's warning tone from Kira's optimistic certainty. Some register elevation in peak moments ("luminescent ache") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("tears that caught the lantern light like fallen stars") with good variation in sentence structure. However, several phrases edge toward purple prose ("glimmering obsidian arbor," "wordless melody") and the final sentence runs long without clear propulsion. Some template phrasing around "grandmothers leaning on teenagers."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard setting and extinct languages create fresh texture, while the street artist mystery adds unexpected urban art elements to this mythic landscape. The synthesis of ancient community bonds with contemporary tagging culture offers genuine originality. The specific detail of seven extinct dialects and marsh reed weaving elevates beyond generic "lost artist" territory.</comment>
