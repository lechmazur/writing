<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margot's three-year burn creates genuine stakes, and her choice between delivery and return carries visible cost. The internal contradiction between anger and understanding plays out through concrete action rather than summary, though Viktor's motivations could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: burning leads to isolation, message brings reunion, revelation reframes the burn as intentional freedom. Closure lands with Charged Poise as Margot accepts the folder knowing she's uniquely positioned as "the ghost in the machine," with cost visible in three years of running now transformed into agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cliff face, mist, and snow-codes constrain movement and communication methods effectively. Cyrillic letters in ice formations create specificity, though the setting could more actively pressure choices beyond providing concealment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal survival to nuclear protocols, with Margot's burned status transforming from liability to unique asset. The reversal that her burning was intentional protection narrows her options to acceptance or walking away, with genuine cost in either path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of transformation through breaking emerges organically—the burned agent becomes the only trustworthy messenger. "Everything broken could be mended—or at least transformed into something useful" resonates without moralizing, though the nuclear plot feels slightly generic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains spy-thriller precision with selective details like "basement rooms of the Aquarium" and "morphine tablet—unused, unnecessary." POV stays cleanly with Margot throughout, though some phrases like "silver hush" feel slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose generally clean with strong moments like "The mist rolled across Zephyr Bluff like a living thing." Some repetition of "silver hush" and occasional overwriting ("prudently daring") create minor friction without damaging closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The burned spy setup is competent genre work elevated by the specific reversal that burning was protective rather than punitive. While well-executed, the nuclear protocols plot and mountain meeting feel familiar from spy fiction.</comment>
