<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Victoria's internal contradiction between perceiving truth and being unable to speak it drives genuine complexity, with her final choice to break the pattern earning visible cost through the loss of her gift. The "eloquently silent" curse manifests concretely in scene rather than as label, though some interior passages drift toward explanation rather than embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through standing waves of perception that build toward Victoria's Decisive Change—destroying both window and gift. Cost lands unmistakably when she can no longer read the gardener's resentment or cook's sorrow, with the mockingbird's unknowable song crystallizing the price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sepia reading room functions as more than backdrop—its amber light, mahogany shelves, and eventual shattered window constrain and enable Victoria's choice. Sensory detail filters through her gift-altered perception ("standing waves rippled through the amber-tinted air"), though some passages catalog rather than integrate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through the gramophone's revelations—from understanding the gift's mechanism to seeing generational poison to facing her binary choice. The final throw of the crank handle forecloses her path with immediate, dramatized consequence in her lost perception.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete cost of inherited power—"some gifts were too heavy to pass on" resonates without moralizing because we witness Victoria pay the price. The mockingbird's unknowable song reweights all prior moments of unwanted knowledge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm ("The last Whitmore sat in the sepia reading room"), though some passages lean toward elevated diction that doesn't fully match Victoria's interiority. The perceptual signature of someone who sees too much comes through in selective detail.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("Glass shattered in a cascade of golden fragments"), but template constructions appear ("Victoria felt," "She saw," "She could") and some passages paraphrase rather than advance. The final image lands cleanly without loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a perception-based curse passed through gramophone recordings offers fresh inflection on inherited burden narratives. While dynasty stories aren't novel, the specific mechanism and Victoria's choice to embrace not-knowing transforms familiar material.</comment>
