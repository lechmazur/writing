<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong characterization through concrete details like Chen's shift from field to lab work and Mira's patient observation methods. The jade cicada moment where Mira closes Chen's fingers around it demonstrates earned character change through gesture rather than declaration. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("the weight of that knowledge") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Chen's implied return to the chronicle work. The jade cicada and tidal pool patterns accumulate meaning toward "every ending is just the pause before another beginning." Cost is visible in Chen's retreat and return. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the grotto setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The grotto's tidal pools function as micro-settings that constrain and enable the conversation—"wet stone where centuries of high tides had left their stories." Sensory details like "bioluminescent plankton sparkled like fallen stars" charge the final image. The environment actively shapes meaning through the pools' various time scales mirroring the thematic concern.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether Chen will return to chronicle work, with pressure building through the jade cicada exchange and pool observations. The "wave larger than the rest" provides environmental escalation that "rearranging the topography of their conversation." Cost is legible in Chen's fear of foresight burden, though the resolution feels slightly predetermined rather than fought for.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pools' "simultaneous transformations" and cicada metaphor of transition. The final image of "each creature poised in its own perfect transition" resonates without stating a moral. Strong integration of time/transition concept through concrete pool life rather than abstract philosophy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm—"The pause that followed wasn't silence—it hummed with the susurration of retreating waves." Dialogue carries subtext effectively, particularly Chen's "Do you know why cicadas?" Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("susurration," "calcium cities") slightly above character lexicon but maintains consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, several instances of elevated diction ("susurration of retreating waves," "microscopic symphonies," "calcium cities") create mild overwriting. Some paraphrase proximity in the pools' description sections. Information density is good but occasional abstraction ("the texture of these transitions") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of marine biology observation with philosophical time concepts through the jade cicada artifact. The specific detail of "seventeen years underground" cicadas connecting to tidal pool cycles shows originality. Transformation of mentor-student dynamic through shared field experience avoids cliché resolution.</comment>
