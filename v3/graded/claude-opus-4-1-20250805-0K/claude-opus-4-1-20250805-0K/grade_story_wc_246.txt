I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This operates as a **Hybrid** piece, beginning with Causal linkages (mistake → guilt → discovery) but shifting to Accumulative/Textural at closure where the anomaly's reality-editing properties create a crystallized moment of choice.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's internal conflict between accepting edited history versus preserving her mistake is well-embodied through the pen's weight and her "confident uncertainty." The choice to transmit both coordinates shows genuine character complexity. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("guilt had nearly broken her") rather than fully embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong Charged Poise closure where Mira faces crystallized options with clear cost - either path sacrifices something vital. The anomaly's reality-editing mechanism is coherent and pays off. Slight deduction for the somewhat convenient timing of the rescue ship's arrival and the abstract nature of the "edited history" concept's mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly setting directly constrains choice and charges the final image through its reality-editing properties. Excellent integration of the fountain pen as micro-setting that anchors emotional stakes. The bent starlight and selective wavelength filtering create vivid, purposeful atmosphere that shapes the central dilemma.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake (saving colonists versus preserving discovery) escalates through Mira's realization that accepting the edit means losing crucial knowledge. Cost is visible in the final choice to let another decide. However, the pressure doesn't fully tighten as the anomaly offers a somewhat convenient out rather than forcing Mira to definitively choose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of subjective reality and the value of mistakes emerges organically through the anomaly's personalized editing. The grandfather's "contingent relationships" theory elegantly supports the thematic question. Final image of "wrong seeds grow unexpected gardens" resonates without moralizing, though the meta-commentary about editing reality occasionally surfaces too explicitly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct voice with scientific register appropriate to Mira's role, though some passages drift into overly explanatory mode ("Not rewriting the past, but revising how the universe presented its own story"). The perceptual signature of a signal interpreter seeing patterns everywhere is consistent. Minor register inconsistencies in emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of abstract telling ("The discovery had started three months ago") and conceptual redundancy around the editing metaphor. Some filter-heavy passages ("she watched," "Mira felt") reduce immediacy. The recursive "editing/revising" language occasionally creates loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a cosmic phenomenon that edits reality based on observer consciousness offers genuine freshness. The integration of grandfather's physics theories with personal guilt creates non-obvious synthesis. The choice to transmit both coordinates subverts expected resolution patterns effectively.</comment>
