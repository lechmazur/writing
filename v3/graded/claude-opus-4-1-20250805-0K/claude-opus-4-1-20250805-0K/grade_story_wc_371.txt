Looking at this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, I'll evaluate each category systematically.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern and density increase toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lila accepts her role as witness/minister to the impossible.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with Lila's specific perception of reality's "soft edges" and her progression from observer to active minister. The final choice to continue planting seeds carries visible cost (commitment to this strange duty), though some moments edge toward diagnostic self-awareness ("cursed awareness... was not madness but ministry").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - Lila's acceptance of her role as guardian of "displaced sacred" with clear cost (lifelong commitment to this strange ministry). The accumulative structure coheres well, building from bread appearances through garden revelations to the tea house encounter that reweights everything.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective detail ("waxed paper that Moretti's Bakery had used," "midnight lettuce and moon radishes") creates a lived-in magical realist world. The guerrilla gardens constrain choices and the tea house setting enables the crucial revelation, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("moths that wrote messages").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from mysterious bread to understanding Lila's role as witness/absoluter of the impossible. The tea house revelation meaningfully tightens options - Lila must continue this work or abandon the sacred things needing form, with clear cost in lifelong commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars - bread as persistent love, gardens as doorways for the sacred. The final image of the flickering tea house "waiting for someone else to need what only the attentive could see" offers a resonant, non-literal answer about attention as ministry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with Lila's distinct perceptual signature ("reality bent in small, merciful ways"). Some register drift into elevated diction ("heuristic kindness," "benevolent secrets") that doesn't fully match the grounded gardener voice, and dialogue occasionally feels written rather than spoken.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but several instances of elevated register ("ministry," "absolution," "heuristic kindness") that feel forced. Some paraphrase loops ("sacred hides in ordinary things" / "displaced sacred") and occasional overwriting in metaphorical density dilute momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism with guerrilla gardening as spiritual practice. The concept of "planting truth in abandoned spaces" and bread as "densely woven memories" offers genuine originality, though some elements (tea house appearance, wise elder figure) lean toward familiar territory.</comment>
