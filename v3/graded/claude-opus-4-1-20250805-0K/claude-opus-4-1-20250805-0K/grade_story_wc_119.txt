I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where Chen's fortune-writing builds toward his own disappearance through pattern and resonance rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Chen's internal contradiction between writing "meaningless" fortunes that come true drives genuine complexity. His final choice to disappear is earned through accumulated pressure, though some interiority relies on exposition rather than embodied emotion ("Chen understood the paradox perfectly").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Chen stepping through the lighthouse door, accepting his role as composer of his own disappearance. The accumulative structure coheres, but the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt—we understand his transformation intellectually but don't feel its emotional price on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Skeleton Rock's atmosphere of "open secrets" constrains every interaction brilliantly—the lighthouse beam's rhythm matching Chen's writing creates environmental pressure. The microdot specs and fortune slips function as micro-settings that shape choices throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from observing others' fortunes coming true to Chen writing his own prophecy. The Bulgarian's pale realization effectively tightens pressure, though the final transformation could carry more immediate dramatic weight rather than philosophical resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of "writing futures that insist on becoming present" emerges organically through concrete action. The final revelation that "everyone on Skeleton Rock was writing their own fortune" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights all prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout—Chen sees fortunes as musical notation, notices the lighthouse's rhythm. The prose modulates effectively with emotional beats, though occasional register elevation ("transpose their lives into new keys") slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of elevated diction clash with immediacy ("elaborate pantomime of coincidence," "orchestrated something different"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("fortunes had developed an uncomfortable habit of coming true" followed by similar restatements).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of spy thriller and fortune cookie mysticism feels fresh and inevitable. The concept of fortunes as musical notation and dead drops transforms familiar espionage tropes through specific, grounded detail that couldn't be swapped to another setting.</comment>
