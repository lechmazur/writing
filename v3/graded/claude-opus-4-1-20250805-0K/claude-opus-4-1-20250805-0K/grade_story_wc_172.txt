I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered revelations about Vera's paradoxical preservation-through-destruction methodology, with density increasing toward the final image of fractured salvation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's contradictory impulses operate simultaneously throughout - destroying to preserve, public monster/private mourner. The final act of burial carries earned weight from established motivations. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("sentiment was a luxury she couldn't afford publicly") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as Vera completes another ritual burial, crystallizing her terrible methodology with visible cost ("Even if salvation looked exactly like destruction"). The accumulative lens holds as each revelation reweights her actions. Orientation anchored early and effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The salt flat functions as both setting and constraint - its acoustic properties essential to preservation, the drought-carved map revealing extinct migration routes. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from boots on salt to helicopter departure. The environment directly enables her preservation method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: from apparent ecological destruction to revealed preservation archive, with cost visible in "disasters that saved what fragments remained." The dominant stake (preservation through destruction) tightens as we understand her terrible calculus. One meaningful deepening achieved.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through concrete particulars - the egg in salt, acoustic fossils, drought-carved maps. The final image of "grace came broken, piece by hoarded piece" offers resonant non-literal answer to the central paradox without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Vera reads the land ("perfect map," "nature's own desperation"). Voice maintains consistent scientific precision tempered by private emotion. Some register elevation in places ("albumin," "calcium carbonate resonance") fits her expertise but occasionally distances.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("crystalline crust," "acoustic fossil beds"). Information density high - most lines advance multiple layers. Some metaphor density in peak beats ("archive of absences," "museum of drought") without becoming muddy. Minor template cadence in "She'd [verb]" constructions mid-story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis: billionaire eco-villain as secret grief-driven archivist. The concept of preservation through manufactured catastrophe feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in making the protagonist genuinely monstrous while maintaining emotional truth (+0.3 within band for bold moral ambiguity).</comment>
