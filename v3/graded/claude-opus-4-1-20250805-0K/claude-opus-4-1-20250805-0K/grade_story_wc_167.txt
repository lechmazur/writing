<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's contemplative nature and gift for "reading between lines" drive meaningful internal progression from seeing surfaces to understanding depths. His final realization about "surfaces as birthplaces of possibility" represents earned wisdom through concrete observation, though the transformation lacks visceral embodied emotion during peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens coheres as Marcus's observations build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where impending demolition reframes his life's work from installing windows to teaching others to see. The closure lands with conceptual cost (losing the atrium) but the emotional price remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prism atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables Marcus's final understanding, with water ripples and light refraction creating a lived-in sensory environment. Setting directly charges the closure as the atrium's imminent destruction gives urgency to Marcus's documentation impulse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The development company's demolition letter creates external pressure that forces Marcus's stance crystallization about preserving knowledge before destruction. However, the conflict remains largely internal without dramatic confrontation, and Marcus faces no immediate trade-offs or visible prices during his contemplation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the extended metaphor of surfaces/boundaries as "places where different things meet and create something new," with the ripple patterns embodying complexity from simplicity. The final image of circles meeting to create new patterns resonates without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Marcus's glazier-specific way of noticing light behavior, stress fractures, and glass properties. Free indirect style maintains consistency with contemplative rhythm, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("birthplaces of possibility") slightly outside a tradesman's natural lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves lyrical density with purposeful repetition of water/light imagery, though several abstract formulations ("conversation between what was and what could be") and occasional register elevation dilute immediacy. Information density remains high with most sentences advancing both external observation and internal realization.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The glazier-as-philosopher angle offers fresh perspective on craftsmanship and perception, with ripple interference patterns as a reading method providing originality. However, the contemplative-epiphany structure follows familiar templates without significant risk-taking or transformation of the form.</comment>
