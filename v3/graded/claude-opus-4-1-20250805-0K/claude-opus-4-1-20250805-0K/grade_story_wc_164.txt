I'll evaluate this story as a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece - density builds through layered metaphors, emotional fossils, and pattern recognition, culminating in the sprout discovery that reweights the collector's understanding.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is consistent and embodied through concrete actions (collecting crater glass, feeling emotional fossils). Internal contradiction emerges between her cheerful demeanor and the weight of loss she processes. However, the character lacks a decisive choice or renunciation at closure - the realization about seeds is contemplative rather than active, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing when paths transform from "disappeared" to "scattered seeds" with the sprout discovery reweighting the entire collection process. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The accumulative lens holds consistently but the closure lacks the decisive weight needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The iridescent cave constrains movement and work conditions effectively ("Time to go, before her own memories began to blur"). Sensory details are selective and purposeful (crater glass warmth, cave breathing). The sprouts in crystal cracks provide the crucial environmental element that enables the final realization, making setting essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on understanding loss and memory's impermanence, established early through the recollectionist's work. The pressure deepens through accumulated emotional fossils but lacks a true tightening or forcing event. The discovery of sprouts provides mild escalation but without forcing a choice or extracting visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation metaphor - paths becoming seeds. The final image of sprouts in crystal cracks offers a non-literal answer to why paths disappear without stating a moral. The piece avoids abstraction through specific emotional fossils ("Joy that tasted purple"), though it occasionally veers toward philosophical musing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with controlled rhythm and distinctive perceptual signatures ("sea-foam recollectionist," "kaleidoscope of light"). The "cheerfully gloomy" tone modulates appropriately. Some register elevation occurs ("transliterating emotions," "liminal space") but remains within an educated POV's plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density and varied syntax, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("bells wrapped in velvet") and abstract philosophizing that slows momentum. The paraphrase loop about paths disappearing (paragraphs 5-6) creates redundancy. Line-level craft is competent but lacks the precision needed for higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of a "sea-foam recollectionist" collecting emotional fossils offers genuine freshness. The transformation of disappeared paths into scattered seeds provides an earned reweighting. However, some elements feel derivative (crystal cave setting, memory-as-physical-objects trope) without sufficient transformation.</comment>
