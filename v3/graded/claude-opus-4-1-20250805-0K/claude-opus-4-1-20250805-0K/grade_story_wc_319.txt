<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guardian's feral transformation is embodied through concrete details (clicking growls, bare feet, vertical pupils) and her contradictory impulses between isolation and homesickness act simultaneously throughout. The final choice to trust uncertainty is earned through her established relationship with it ("befriended uncertainty. It lived in her bones"), though the scholar's rapid trust strains slightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as details of the guardian's transformation layer toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where she chooses uncertain retrieval over certain isolation. Cost is visible in what she leaves behind (the frozen garden that has become her skeleton) and risks ("not knowing if you'll arrive whole"). Opening orientation is slightly delayed but pays off thematically.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen garden functions as both external setting and internal state ("bringing the garden's endless winter inside herself until ice crystals formed in her thoughts"), constraining choices through its sealed nature. The library's impossible geometry and the pendant's boundary-revealing properties directly shape the final decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from defending texts to personal rescue when the scholar arrives seeking help for a trapped sister, forcing the guardian to choose between safe isolation and risky return. The pendant's warmth recognizing "another traveler between worlds" tightens pressure effectively, though the scholar's quick trust reduces some tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of boundaries—physical (monastery walls), dimensional (pendant's visions), and personal (feral transformation)—culminating in dissolution of all three. The final image of stepping "into luminous uncertainty" resonantly answers the central question of isolation versus connection without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature tracks the guardian's devolution through sensory details (frost and fear replacing coffee and paper) and her unique way of seeing boundaries. Voice modulates effectively from lyrical opening to spare middle to hopeful ending, though dialogue occasionally feels slightly formal for the stress level.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong moments ("The monastery's walls had become her skeleton, its sealed windows her eyes") with good information density. Some figurative density in early paragraphs ("hollow spaces in her ribs," "frozen exterior world") clusters without full payoff, and occasional filter constructions ("she could feel," "she could sometimes reach") dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a feral library guardian defending texts from dimensional parasites offers a fresh angle on portal fantasy. The specific synthesis of physical devolution with dimensional awareness ("pupils gone vertical from too much time seeing in library darkness") feels earned, though the resolution mechanism is somewhat familiar.</comment>
