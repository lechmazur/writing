<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elsa's reticent nature and Jonas's spectral loneliness create genuine contradictory impulses that drive the closure choice to become the new keeper. The transformation from supply captain to lighthouse guardian feels earned through her established comfort with isolation versus loneliness. Minor deduction for the ghosts' somewhat convenient emotional clarity in their final state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elsa accepts the keeper role, transforming isolation into purpose with visible cost (her former life). The accumulative/textural lens holds as anonymous letters, stone messages, and ghostly revelations build to reweight the lighthouse's meaning. The "tears falling like sea glass" provides conceptual cost linking safety and sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse's dead eye, phosphorescent foam, and breathing stairs create atmospheric pressure that shapes Elsa's ascent. The lantern room's glass walls and brass housing become tools for the transformation. Setting constrains choice when the darkened lamp requires intention rather than oil, though some descriptive passages lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from mysterious letters to discovering Jonas is dead to understanding all keepers are trapped souls, each revelation narrowing Elsa's options. The dominant stake—preventing loneliness from consuming both living and dead—crystallizes when she must choose to tend the light. Cost is visible in forsaking her boat captain life.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the distinction between solitude and loneliness, with the sea glass holding "memories of feeling safe" becoming a concrete vessel for abstract safety. The final stone message "You are not alone" resonantly answers the central question without moralizing. Slight deduction for the overly neat ghost resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elsa's selective perception (reading stone messages, preferring waves to people) creates a distinct POV signature. Voice modulates effectively from terse observation to the lyrical "tears falling like sea glass." Some filter verb accumulation ("She'd always been," "They'd developed") dulls immediacy in the middle section.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong opening and closing lines with varied sentence structure throughout. Information density is high in the stone message decoding and lamp-lighting sequences. Deductions for paraphrase loops ("loneliness is worse than death"/"solitude consumed us"), some filter verb stacks, and the slightly purple "phosphorescent foam" description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of lighthouse keepers becoming ghosts who write anonymous letters to combat loneliness offers a fresh angle on the haunted lighthouse trope. The stone message system and lamp responding to intention rather than oil provide specific innovations. The synthesis of isolation-as-gift feels earned though not groundbreaking.</comment>
