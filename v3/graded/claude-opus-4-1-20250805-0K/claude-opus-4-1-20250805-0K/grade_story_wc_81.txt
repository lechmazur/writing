Looking at this story through the lens of a demanding editor, I'll evaluate it as an Accumulative/Textural piece where pattern detection and revelation build toward a Conceptual Repricing about historical truth.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and embodied through her physical interaction with books, detecting frequencies through touch and bone conduction. The contradiction between her role as mere "indexer" and her deeper mission to preserve truth creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("tranquilly perceptive purpose") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where the revelation about falsified water rights treaties reweights the entire submersion narrative. The cost is legible—truth can only be preserved in fragments during rare blackouts, and Mira must work against constant technological interference. The accumulative pattern of frequency detection builds effectively to this repricing of history.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The submerged library setting directly constrains Mira's work—she can only detect forgeries during blackouts when electromagnetic interference ceases. The phosphorescent algae provide both the specific light wavelength needed for her ink and create atmospheric pressure. The environment shapes every tactical choice, from timing to methodology.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the ticking clock of the backup generators cycling, forcing Mira to work with "practiced efficiency." The deepening revelation about systematic historical alteration raises the stakes from individual document verification to exposing corporate conspiracy. Cost is visible in the limited windows for truth preservation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between analog permanence (brass stamp, ink) and digital fragility. The final image of algae protecting "secrets written in honest ink" resonantly answers questions about truth's survival without stating a moral. The pattern of forgeries revealing corporate profit from the city's drowning adds thematic depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical precision appropriate to Mira's expertise, with selective perception focused on frequencies and resonances. Some register elevation in places ("tranquilly perceptive purpose") slightly strains the POV. The controlled, methodical rhythm effectively mirrors Mira's systematic work.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("tranquilly perceptive purpose," "dappled resolve"). Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor template cadence in the middle section with repeated "She [verb]" constructions reduces variety.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh angle on document authentication through frequency detection and the concept of truth surviving only in technological blind spots. The specific detail about bone-conducting earpieces and vacuum-sealed volumes creates originality. The revelation about water rights treaties transforms what could be generic dystopia into specific corporate critique.</comment>
