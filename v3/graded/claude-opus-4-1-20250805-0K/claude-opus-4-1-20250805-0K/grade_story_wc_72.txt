<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thessaly's contradictory impulses—choosing genocide of thousands to prevent genocide of millions—act powerfully in scene with visible cost. Marina's nuanced response avoiding simple judgment feels earned. Minor deduction for slight therapy-speak ("roiling emotions") and the somewhat convenient ease of telepathic communication establishment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Thessaly's "settling" from absolute judgment to witnessed complexity, with Marina as conduit for truth's nuanced telling. The cascading memory structure drives causally through revelation to moral repricing. Cost is legible in "weight of her secret creating structural weakness." Slight deduction for the mildly abstract final line about "stone animate with possibility."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drowned garden with kelp threading through marble effectively constrains the story—Thessaly literally frozen as statue, Marina descending in diving bell. The foxglove ampoule's "purple residue glowing faintly" provides specific visual anchor. Setting doesn't quite reach higher bands as it could pressure choices more actively beyond the basic underwater constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through cascading revelations: garden keeper's refusal → forced paralysis → telepathic flood-calling → Marina's career/reputation crisis. The moral calculus between "terrible choices" lands with weight. Deduction for Marina's acceptance coming slightly too easily without more resistance to losing her life's work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the purple poison metaphor—"mixed from red necessity and blue grief"—avoiding simple hero/villain binary. The ending reweights the garden from forgotten ruin to "monument to the complexity of choice." Marina's offering of nuance rather than judgment provides the non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thessaly's telepathic voice reads distinctly "incisively kind despite centuries of solitude." Some elegant touches like "bubbles escaping her regulator" ground the underwater POV. Deductions for occasional register elevation ("algae-covered form," "eternal sentinel") and the somewhat generic phrasing of emotional states ("roiling emotions").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("kelp forests thread through marble archways"). Several template phrases weaken impact: "surprising herself with," "nearly dropped," "hands trembled"—stock physical reactions. The abstract ending about stone being "animate with possibility" and "every shade of gray" dulls the closure's specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The telepathic statue garden-keeper who destroyed her own city to prevent genocide offers fresh moral complexity. The purple poison as metaphor for mixed necessity and grief shows originality. Deduction for somewhat familiar underwater lost city setting and the convenient mind-reading resolution mechanism.</comment>
