<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orin's prism-mind gift creates genuine internal complexity through contradictory perception streams in the grotto, and the final choice to continue the vigilance tradition lands with clear sacrificial cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "seeds of vigilance" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through layered discoveries to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Orin accepts the keeper role, with visible cost in the blood-ink tradition. The gravity inversion creates effective temporal pressure, though the sealed wing revelation feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto's transformation during gravity inversion creates vivid sensory detail ("water droplets fell upward like silver rain"), and the crystalline nodes function as constraining elements for the final choice. The prism-mind's triple perception of the grotto enriches atmosphere meaningfully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the gravity timer and deepening revelations about dangerous knowledge, culminating in Orin's acceptance of the keeper role. The cost is legible in the blood-ink tradition, though middle-section pressure could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between preserving and suppressing dangerous knowledge, with the doodles serving as both warning and map. The final image of Orin drawing new luminous warnings effectively reweights the opening without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signature through the prism-mind concept, particularly strong in the grotto sequence. Some elevated diction ("metastasize," "clandestinely luminous") occasionally strains against the medieval setting but serves the archival voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("water droplets fell upward like silver rain"), but some abstract phrasing dilutes immediacy ("seeds of vigilance," "latent blaze"). Minor template cadence in the crystalline node revelation sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prism-mind concept offers a fresh take on multiple realities perception, and the gravity inversion as discovery mechanism feels inventive. The blood-ink tradition and dangerous knowledge archive avoid standard fantasy tropes through specific detail.</comment>
