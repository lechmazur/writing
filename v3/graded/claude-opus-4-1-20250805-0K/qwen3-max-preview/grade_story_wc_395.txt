<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's obsessive pursuit and her final acceptance of the crew's liminal state shows strong internal consistency. Her lies to various parties reveal layered motivation. The transformation from hunter to anchor is earned through accumulated discoveries, though the crew themselves lack individuated presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught recursion (0707) that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she becomes the crew's anchor. The cost is visible in her isolation and perpetual vigil. Minor orientation wobble around "temporal coordinates" but recovers through concrete action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive-as-mausoleum and server resonance chamber create atmospheric pressure. The Helios-7 patch constrains her final choice to wear it as signal. Some technical descriptions drift toward abstraction ("de-referenced from reality's index") but the physical details of screens flickering and drives spinning ground the supernatural elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation follows discovery pattern from numbers to coordinates to ritual restoration, with each revelation narrowing her options. The final cost—eternal vigilance as their anchor—is legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the crew exists in system gaps rather than being deleted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of digital persistence versus erasure emerges through concrete server details and the patch's physical presence. Her lies create a resonant pattern about truth existing in gaps. The ending reweights deletion as transformation rather than absence without stating this moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent close-third with selective perception focused on digital archaeology details. Some register elevation in peak moments ("de-referenced," "resonance chamber") strains against the corporate setting. The repetitive "She lies" structure in the ending creates purposeful rhythm though risks becoming mechanical.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences advancing discovery or atmosphere. Some conceptual abstraction ("temporal not spatial," "resonance not record") requires re-reading. Template cadence appears in the final "She lies" sequence but serves rhythmic purpose. Minor metaphor strain with "mausoleum" servers that also "hum."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of digital ghosts in server architecture offers a fresh angle on haunted technology. The specific detail of 07:07 as temporal coordinates and the crew becoming system latency transforms familiar missing persons material. Risk-taking with the supernatural tech fusion mostly succeeds.</comment>
