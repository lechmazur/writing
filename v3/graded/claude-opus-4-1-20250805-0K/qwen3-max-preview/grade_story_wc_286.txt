<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The potter's motivation flows from consistent philosophical stance through concrete micro-choices (pouring water for the bee, choosing not to fire the clay). Internal consistency strong, though the epiphanic understanding of the oasis's nature edges toward convenient insight rather than fully dramatized discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught time fractures paying off in resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands through Earned Stasis (leaving the pot unfired) with visible cost in choosing porosity over permanence. Minor orientation delay in opening but recovers through concrete anchoring by second paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of micro-setting where lantern glass, clay pot, and bee movements constrain choices and charge the final image. The oasis functions as both physical space and temporal anomaly, with sensory details (thrum in marrow, smoke flattening) filtered through zen-minded perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes emerge through accumulation rather than causal escalation - each discovery deepens understanding of temporal resistance. The dominant stake (understanding why places resist change) tightens through the bee's arrival and glass's response to kindness, though agency remains primarily observational until the final choice not to fire.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of resistance/surrender, with the pot-as-vessel metaphor earning its resonance through prior clay work. The final image of light passing through fractures delivers non-literal answer to the central question without stating moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature maintained through zen-filtered observations ("like liquid regret," "palimpsest of summers"). Lyric compression serves the temporal fracture concept, though occasional elevation ("truncated cathedrals") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs. Minor figurative density in places ("dunes that shifted like liquid regret") but pattern-taught and purposeful. Clean propulsion through varied syntax, no loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-fracture concept with beekeeping imagery creates non-obvious resonances. The phototropic kindness mechanism and choice to leave clay unfired show genuine risk-taking that heightens meaning without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
