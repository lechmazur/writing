<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with contradictory impulses (carrying 27 souls while drumming rebellion). The transformation from passive subject to active "weaver/drummer/dreamer" is earned through concrete micro-choices. Loses points for some diagnostic label-speak ("fractured psyche," "entangled memories") and the final emotional resolution feels slightly too neat for the horror of the premise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through drumming that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she transforms from victim to creator. The cost is visible in "auroral sorrow that clung to her—not as grief, but as grace." Orientation anchors clearly (experimental subject, sound garden, 27 souls). Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the final transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sound garden functions as active setting that responds to and amplifies her drumming, constraining and enabling her transformation. Vivid sensory detail ("liquid light swirling," "harmonic chimes that spiraled upward"). The auric lagoon serves as both mirror and transformative medium. Slightly abstract in places but the environment actively shapes the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes clear from opening (managing 27 grafted consciousnesses). Escalation through drumming rebellion that transforms the garden and herself. The cost is felt in the weight of carrying others' memories. However, the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off—she achieves wholeness without losing anything concrete, which softens the impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of collective consciousness versus individual identity emerges through concrete action (drumming as rebellion/creation). The final image of shared rhythm between her, garden, and universe offers a non-literal answer about integration versus isolation. Strong subtext in the drumming itself as both protest and communion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("each beat was a rebellion: not loud, not violent, but persistent"). Perceptual signature clear in how she experiences the entangled memories. Minor register elevation in places ("auroral sorrow," "braided into one") but it serves the piece's heightened reality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied syntax and rhythm. Information density high in most passages. However, some overwriting in figurative language ("auroras trapped in glass," "iron to a magnet") and occasional template cadence in the "She drummed for..." sequence, though it builds purposeful momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on consciousness-merging through the specific frame of sound/drumming as resistance and creation. The experimental treatment survivor who transforms trauma into art is earned through specific detail. The concept of drumming rhythms "only the dead would recognize" is particularly striking.</comment>
