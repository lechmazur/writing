<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mystic's motivation to prove objects absorb emotions drives consistent choices through prism-frost communion, with embodied sensory work ("fingers numb but steady") and internal contradictions between scientific rigor and spiritual openness. The driver's complex emotional state—guilt, love, relief in surrender—creates layered characterization despite his absence. Minor deduction for some abstraction in lines like "Emotion is mass. Memory is gravity" that edges toward diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through frost-vision revelations, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the mystic chooses silence over publication (Earned Stasis with visible cost). The progression from communion attempt to vision to deliberate withholding tracks causally. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (arbor location unclear) and the conceptual cost of silence being more implied than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The quartz arbor and frost-covered windshield function as active setting elements that enable the central communion, with strong sensory work ("mist curling like breath," "velvet" mist). The prism-frost interface constrains the mystic's method effectively. Slight deduction for vague spatial relationship between arbor and car, though the micro-setting of frost patterns carries significant weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving emotional absorption—escalates through progressive revelations (faces→gestures→driver's moments→final relief), with the mystic's choice to withhold proof creating meaningful cost. However, the escalation lacks sharp tightening moments; the visions accumulate rather than forcing trade-offs. The "shifted hush" functions more as atmosphere than active pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of communion: the tension between scientific proof and spiritual truth, culminating in the choice of personal certainty over public validation. The final image of rainbow light on the kitchen table resonates without moralizing. Strong subtext in the mystic's silence and the driver's preserved peace. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "Emotion is mass" line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and distinctive perceptual signature ("reading braille left by forgotten gods"). Voice modulates effectively during the vision sequence. Some elevated diction ("communion," "resonance") fits the mystic character but occasionally drifts toward purple prose ("mist parting like a curtain for an actor exiting stage").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery and varied sentence structure, particularly in the vision sequence. Information density is high in key passages. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("truthful lie," "wore briefly then returned with reverence"), some filter-verb clustering ("She felt," "She saw," "She knew"), and purple-prose moments that slow momentum without pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise of proving emotional absorption through frost patterns offers a fresh angle on psychometry/object memory. The specific synthesis of scientific method with mystical practice, culminating in the choice of silence over fame, avoids typical resolution patterns. Execution is competent but doesn't fully transform the base concept beyond its prompt-like framing.</comment>
