<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal contradiction between seeking forgiveness from herself while teaching/breaking others creates genuine complexity. The fidgeting fingers that trace phantom chess boards while winnowing threads shows embodied habit under stress. Minor deduction for the boy's shattering being told rather than shown through specific remembered detail.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where "forgiveness had not come from decree or deed, but from winnowing the past until only truth remained" with visible cost in the mirror scene. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through tapestry work to the mirror's acceptance. Orientation anchors effectively by line 2 with "time-frozen village."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth's warming walls and the tapestries' frayed threads constrain her actions and methods throughout. Setting actively shapes choice through the "woven hush" that thickens and lifts. Slightly generic village awakening in final third prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through winnowing progression from external threads to internal recognition: "Every thread she traced echoed her own." The mirror scene forces confrontation with her past self, paying visible emotional cost. One meaningful deepening that reweights her understanding of forgiveness through accumulated pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of winnowing—separating "grief from guilt, intention from impact"—without stating morals. The final image of walking through rain that "coaxes seeds from stubborn soil" resonantly answers the forgiveness question. Threads reknitting "stronger at the broken places" earns the wisdom through specific experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with "cobblestones held their breath" and controlled rhythm that varies with emotional intensity. Clean focalization throughout with no head-hopping. Some register elevation ("testament," "irrelevant") in the final section slightly mismatches the established intimate tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and varied syntax, especially in early passages. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs: "The platinum labyrinth waited at the village square, its metallic walls gleaming cold under a sky that refused to move." Minor template cadence in "She didn't... She walked... Her exile..." sequence near end.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The winnowing-as-forgiveness metaphor offers a fresh angle on self-acceptance narratives. Specific detail like "threads dangled like unfinished thoughts" avoids generic abstraction. The chess tutor examining patterns in tapestries creates organic synthesis though the awakening village resolution trends toward familiar territory.</comment>
