<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal journey from searching daughter to understanding sacrifice shows genuine emotional progression with embodied grief ("tears traced cold paths"). The revelation about her father becoming "silent geometry" and her final dissolution into light demonstrates earned transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("featherly determined") that lacks specific embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure - Elara's stepping into light/distance mirrors her father's sacrifice. The cost is legible in her dissolution and the bench's relieved sigh. The revelation of her own handwriting creates temporal paradox that enriches rather than breaks causality. Slight deduction for delayed orientation (who/where clarifies gradually).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prism terrace and fractured valley create immediate atmospheric pressure, with rainbow mist and void establishing otherworldly stakes. Wood grain analysis as micro-setting constrains choice meaningfully - each pattern reveals emotional history that guides Elara's understanding. The corn maze's golden glow through fractured light charges the final image perfectly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative discoveries: bench grief → logbook cipher → father's sacrifice → temporal paradox → final threshold choice. The dominant stake (understanding sacred thresholds) tightens as each revelation narrows Elara's options toward inevitable sacrifice. Cost is visible in her dissolution, though the single continuous pressure could have benefited from one more distinct tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the threshold metaphor - "places where the world hesitated before becoming." The concept of necessary distances ("between a hand and a flame") develops through concrete particulars without moralizing. The final image of dissolution into "the sacred space between before and after" offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical compression ("bleeding rainbow mist," "fractured hush") that maintains coherence. Perceptual signature strong in how Elara reads wood grain as emotional chronology. Some elevated diction ("fossilized," "consecration") occasionally drifts from character register but serves atmospheric purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose maintains high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("silence here wasn't absence, but compression"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful rhythm shifts. Deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("featherly determined") and some filter-heavy passages ("She intuited," "she understood") that could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of maze architecture, wood grain analysis, and threshold metaphysics creates non-obvious conceptual framework. The idea of becoming "silent geometry that held the world's fraying edges together" transforms sacrifice trope through specific invention. Risk-taking in temporal paradox and dissolution ending heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
