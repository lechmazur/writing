<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's dual allegiance creates genuine internal conflict that drives choices throughout, with her reorganization tactics revealing consistent character traits under pressure. The foundation stone chip functions as both talisman and conscience, grounding her motivations. Deduction for some abstract phrasing around "hopeful desperation" and occasional diagnostic language ("dual allegiance aching") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the final compass image crystallizes options with "postponed" rather than defeated privatization showing visible cost. The accumulative lens holds as graffiti messages build community resistance through pattern and density. Minor deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the raft city's nature.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The raft city setting actively constrains choices—"salt-stained wood and rusted railings" create precarity, while carnival spaces enable covert organizing. Sensory detail filters through Lira's professional eye ("zoning overlays," spatial patterns). The foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting that charges the final compass image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal navigation of gentrification to collective action, with Lira's graffiti campaign forcing community crystallization. The "privatization stalls. Not defeated—postponed" shows clear cost and ongoing tension. Deduction for the corporate scouts section feeling slightly disconnected from the main pressure line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions—graffiti as counter-narrative, reorganization as resistance—without explicit moralizing. The final compass pointing "not north, but home" resonantly reweights the entire struggle between ownership and belonging. Strong subtext in "unowned, ungoverned, unbroken" trinity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends carnival imagery with urban planning vocabulary, creating Lira's unique perceptual signature. Strong rhythmic control in lists ("cotton candy stalls aligned with wind direction"). Deduction for occasional register drift into academic territory ("sustainable luxury housing") that slightly breaks the lyrical flow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and purposeful rhythm variations. Information density high in descriptive passages. Deductions for repetitive "she [verb]" constructions in the middle section and some synonym churn around "reorganize/redirect/salvage" that could be tightened.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The culture shock absorber navigating gentrification through graffiti art offers fresh specificity. The carnival-on-water setting transforms familiar displacement narratives. The "hopeful desperation" tone authentically captures community resistance without easy resolution.</comment>
