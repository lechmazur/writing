<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The meteorologist's grief-driven motivation is embodied through concrete actions (cataloging clouds by emotion) and internal contradictions ("quietly explosive"). Her transformation from scientific observer to emotional archivist is earned through the violin string memory. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("resigned acceptance") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with the closure landing as Resonant Reconfiguration—her smile represents acceptance that "empty spaces remember," with cost visible in months of isolation. The gondola setting and cloud cataloging accumulate texture toward this reweighting. Deduction for slight orientation delay (who/where crystallizes slowly) and the cost being more conceptual than visceral at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sky gondola functions as micro-setting that enables and constrains her observations, with brass telescope as tool-setting that "absorbs secrets." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("wicker floor dusted with starlight"). The clouds themselves become setting elements that pressure her emotional cataloging. Minor deduction for some abstract descriptors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving "empty spaces remember"—drives her methodical cataloging with escalation through Altocumulus #112's dissolution forcing acceptance. Her agency manifests through observation and memorialization rather than action. Cost is visible in her isolation and the months without smiling, though the pressure could tighten more dramatically.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of clouds as emotions and the concept that "emptiness is not void, but vessel." The ending reweights all prior cataloging as acts of preservation rather than mere observation. Strong integration of "spooled wholeness" as binding fragments into new wholes. Slight deduction for one instance of stated theme ("empty spaces remember").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through meteorological-emotional fusion and specific voice markers ("Stratocumulus #47"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance shifts during reflection. Some elevated diction ("furious love," "resigned acceptance") fits the character's analytical-poetic fusion. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that borders on purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (description + emotion + memory). Rhythm varies with scene needs—longer contemplative passages, shorter notations. Some figurative density in places ("frayed thread," "powdered memory") but serves the accumulative texture. Minor loops in cloud description patterns and some abstract emotional labeling reduce the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fusion of meteorological observation with emotional cataloging is fresh and specific. "Spooled wholeness" as a method for gathering fragments offers conceptual originality. The transformation of scientific classification into grief processing feels earned and particular. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
