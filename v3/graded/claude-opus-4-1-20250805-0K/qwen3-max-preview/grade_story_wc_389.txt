I'll evaluate this story systematically under the demanding editor lens.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and prophetic fragments toward a resonant broadcast that reweights everything. The pattern of radio frequencies, fragmented messages, and eventual harmonic transmission coheres as textural accumulation rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation as fidelity to the broken and misfit is concrete and consistent, driving her mission to weave shadows into dawn. Her embodied actions (pressing palm to glass, fingers dancing over knobs, singing to trigger harmonic lattice) reveal character under pressure. The final choice to broadcast using Kael's own towers shows earned agency with visible cost - exposure to those finding her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elira's broadcast piggybacks on Kael's signal towers, reweighting the power dynamic with clear cost (exposure to rebels finding her). The accumulative lens holds as fragmented messages build toward this harmonic transmission. Orientation anchors clearly (Elira at observatory), though the "seven winters" backstory and Kael exposition slightly dilute present-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico functions as micro-setting that constrains choice - its "harmonic lattice" enables the crucial broadcast. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("frost-glazed metal grates," "sapphire veins that pulsed"), filtered through Elira's technical perception. The observatory's elevation "above clouds" provides both isolation and transmission advantage that shapes the final tactical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake - broadcasting counter-narrative against Kael's unity-through-surrender - is signaled early and deepens when rebels start finding Elira through fragmented psalms. The tightening from passive listening to active transmission shows agency, though the cost remains somewhat abstract ("not as weapon, but as carrier wave") rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the shadow/dawn dialectic - "shadows held the roots of resilience." The concept that dawn must be "earned—in mud, in static" rather than sterile chrome offers genuine complexity. The final image of "lonely visionaries who knew how to unfold shadows into wings" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with controlled rhythm ("thunder growled like a caged beast," "oracle bones tossed by a drunken god"). The perceptual signature - hearing "truths others dismissed as static" - is character-specific. Minor register drift occurs in exposition about Kael ("firmware updates") that briefly breaks the mythic-technical fusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("cobalt light spiraled outward, not as a weapon, but as a carrier wave"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("The storm wasn't weather—it was a veil" followed by similar metaphorical assertions). Template cadence emerges in the "She [verb]" pattern across multiple paragraphs, though the lyrical texture partially compensates.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of mystical prophecy with radio technology offers fresh specificity - "hymns from dead satellites, sermons from rebel priests." The concept of variant allegiance as "evolution" rather than betrayal transforms expected rebellion tropes. The risk of elevated diction throughout mostly pays off in creating a unique mythic-technical register.</comment>
