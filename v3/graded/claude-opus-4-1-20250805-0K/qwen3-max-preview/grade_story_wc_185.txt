<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ripple-mark's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking stillness as architecture rather than absence—with concrete embodied actions like reading cave floors through bare feet and tracing ice fractures. The transformation of energy beings from chaos to calm shows earned change through her specific method, though internal contradiction could be sharper during the key middle beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the caves transform from screaming to breathing, the energy beings from storms to drifting lights. Cost is visible in the melting ice wall "dripping in slow metronome" and the largest being's transformation to "dawn mist." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The harmonic caves function as active setting that constrains and enables—limestone throats that once amplified winds now scream, ice walls hold memory in fracture patterns, thermal vents meet glacial seepage. The echo chamber stone and ice fractures directly enable the resolution, making environment indispensable to the story's mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding quiet in chaos—escalates through deepening rather than reversal as Ripple-mark moves from avoiding beings to walking among them "like a current through reeds." The cost manifests in the ice wall's release and the energy being's transformation, though the middle section could tighten the pressure between discovery and application.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "silence as architecture" that can be "conjured" rather than found, avoiding abstract statements. The final image of the largest being cradling the stone "like an egg" offers resonant closure without moralizing, reweighting the invasion as potential harmony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice emerges through compound constructions ("ripple-mark," "map-skin"), specialized diction ("cartographic whorls," "thermal vents"), and consistent perceptual signature focused on vibration and resonance. The prose maintains its geological/sonic register throughout without head-hopping or distance breaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"frozen weeping that had formed over millennia" conveys time, process, and emotional register simultaneously. Some figurative density in places ("storms incarnate, dancing in spirals of raw voltage") but serves the accumulative texture. The "hammered repose" image effectively charges the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of using ice fracture patterns as musical scores to counter chaos is genuinely inventive, transforming the invasion narrative into one of tuning rather than banishment. The synthesis of geological, sonic, and energetic elements creates something specific that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the non-violent resolution heightens thematic stakes (+0.3).</comment>
