<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between Jasper's mechanical cataloging and suppressed longing, with embodied details like "throat tightened" and "knees cracking." The transformation from defensive insulation to "ready to strike" the tuning fork is earned through accumulated pressure, though some emotional transitions could be more granular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration as Jasper shifts from "appraising ghosts" to "listening to them," crystallizing in "What's broken still carries song." Cost is legible in his three years of emotional suppression and the risk of reopening wounds. The orientation anchors (quarry trailer, antiques appraiser role) land within the first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The quarry setting functions as both physical and metaphorical space—"terraced scars" and "echo valley longing" constrain and shape Jasper's emotional journey. The speaker cloth's texture changes with light ("threads glowing amber") to mark the internal shift. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure builds through textural accumulation: from mechanical cataloging to holding cloth to ear, to the laptop moment of "Project Echo." The dominant stake—recovering meaning from loss—tightens when Jasper chooses engagement over insulation, with visible cost in his "pulse thudded" and three years of defensive numbness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the speaker cloth's transformation from "calibration" tool to "tuning fork," with "What's broken still carries song" resonating without moralizing. The quarry's "echo valley longing" metaphor deepens through specifics rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in technical precision ("tensile strength, acoustic transparency coefficient") modulating to sensory openness ("Let the valley's echoes brush his skin"). Clean focalization throughout with intentional psychic distance shifts marking emotional progression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "gravel like a beast chewing stone" and varied sentence rhythms. Some filter verb clusters ("he sensed," "he felt") and mild repetition of "he'd" constructions in middle sections reduce immediacy without pattern-teaching purpose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of roadie/appraiser roles creates unexpected emotional territory. The concept of measuring decay while suppressing emotional value offers genuine complexity. "Confidently uncertain" as character trait transcends paradox to become lived contradiction.</comment>
