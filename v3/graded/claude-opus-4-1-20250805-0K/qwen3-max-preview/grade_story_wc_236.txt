<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's sensory loss creates genuine internal contradiction between her past identity and present reality, with micro-choices (touching for dust, mapping through sound) revealing character under pressure. The birthing screw revelation earns its weight through specific embodied details. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("emotional terrain") but the final choice to bow to the couple shows earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered metaphors (broken clocks, fulcrums, ordinary miracles) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts her new form of practice. Cost is visible in her throat tightening and the weight of understanding. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2. Deduction for slight causality softness in the middle third where reflection dominates action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The repair shop's brass gears, glass reservoirs, and fog create atmospheric pressure that mirrors Elara's occluded perception. The birthing screw and broken clock constrain choices and charge the final therapy table image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("dim corners") but setting successfully functions as emotional landscape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding meaning after sensory loss) signals early and deepens through Ren's reframing of the screw and clock. The "fraudulent healer" tension creates adequate pressure but lacks a sharp tightening moment. Cost appears in accepting the broken clock as sacred but escalation remains gentle rather than forcing hard trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete objects (screw as fulcrum not clamp, broken clocks holding time differently) without explicit moralizing. The final image of arranging unscented lavender "with reverence" offers resonant answer to the central question. Subtext operates well in Ren's indirect wisdom. Minor deduction for "ordinary miracles" appearing too literally in dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyric voice maintains consistent texture through selective perception and rhythm modulation ("voice low as a tide pulling back"). Dialogue between Elara and Ren carries subtext and advances understanding naturally. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Some filter verb accumulation ("she remembered," "she asked") slightly dulls immediacy in middle section.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("waiting like lungs between breaths") with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for template cadence runs ("She would..." repeated 4x in closing) and some paraphrase loops around "emotional terrain." No artifacts touch the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The aromatherapist-without-smell premise offers fresh angle on healing and perception, transformed through specific details (grandmother's birthing tool, water clock mechanisms). The synthesis of mechanical grace with human labor feels earned. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
