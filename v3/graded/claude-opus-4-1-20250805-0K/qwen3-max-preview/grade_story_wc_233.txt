<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with feet remembering marble, lungs powering firefly glow, and the queen's transformation from authority to witness. The character's motivation through dreams and her choice to climb despite warnings creates clear causality. Minor deduction for the figure's somewhat abstract presence and the slightly rushed emotional processing in the grotto scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with bleeding starlight as the central metaphor building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the queen becomes "vessel" and "witness." The closure lands with visible cost—she must "unbury what you buried" and descend transformed. Orientation anchors (queen, cliff, dusk) establish early; the grotto revelation reweights her entire history through the pool visions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory specificity: "velvet robes traded for linen that whispered against her skin like regret," "moss and shale" replacing marble, "ozone and old roses." The grotto itself constrains and enables the transformation—its bleeding starlight, liquid night pool, and sealed entrance create a liminal space where "time bent." Setting actively shapes the queen's journey from palace to bare-footed ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (dreams) through physical (dangerous climb) to existential (confronting buried truth). The fireflies' appearance as breathing-synchronized guides and the grotto's revelation about her child create meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in tears creating constellations and the requirement to "unbury what you buried," though the figure's role could apply more direct pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bleeding starlight metaphor—memory and truth leak through attempts at burial. The pool scenes showing her progression from hope to the Edict of Silence to her child's release create layered meaning without stating morals. Final image of fireflies clinging "like living lace" while the grotto seals offers resonant answer: transformation requires witnessing, not ruling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled compression: "dusk curling its fingers around the kingdom's spine," "cobwebs dipped in frost." POV remains stable in close third with clean free indirect style. The figure's dialogue maintains appropriate distance ("You chose power over pulse. Rule over resonance.") while the queen's perceptual signature shapes every image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong sentence-level propulsion with varied rhythm matching emotional beats. Information density high: "her crown long pawned for bread" does multiple jobs efficiently. Some elevated diction ("astral light pooling in hollows like mercury wine") serves the lyric mode. Minor deduction for occasional density in metaphor clustering and slight repetition in the grotto description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis combining fairy tale frame with psychological depth—dreams as literal bleeding starlight, fireflies synchronized with breathing. The pool showing scenes rather than reflection and the child sent through a starlight portal offer non-obvious angles. The transformation from queen to witness/vessel avoids expected redemption arcs while maintaining emotional truth.</comment>
