<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The luminous skeptic's internal contradiction between doubt and curiosity drives genuine choices, particularly in her testing methodology (copper/ozone/honey) and final shift from skepticism to trust. The man's characterization as archive rather than victim adds depth. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract handling of her "luminous" quality and some therapy-speak around "surrender" in the resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the skeptic's shift from doubt to trust as she learns to "carry less, taste more." The forest election system and convergence points establish consistent world rules. Cost is visible in the man's dissolution and her surrender of certainty. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of "terrestrially cosmic" which never fully crystallizes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lavender bluff setting and aurora actively shape the narrative through the convergence point mechanics. Exceptional sensory work through taste-as-navigation (copper/ozone/honey progression). The mycelial network voting system creates a lived-in world where setting constrains and enables choices. The final image of lavender "forgetting the storm, remembering the rain" charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why people carry weather—escalates through the taste progression and culminates in the man's absorption by the forest. Agency manifests through her choice to trust rather than doubt. Cost is legible in his dissolution and her surrender of skepticism. Minor deduction for the slightly passive nature of her role in the central transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the forest's democratic absorption of human weather as archive, not punishment. The concept of surrender versus solving resonates without preaching. The "terrestrially cosmic" notion—Earth-scaled to human longing—offers fresh perspective. Final image of "forgetting the storm, remembering the rain" provides non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism and consistent POV distance. The perceptual signature through taste-sensing is unique and maintained. Prose modulates effectively between description and action. Some register elevation in phrases like "terrestrially cosmic grace" slightly strains the established voice but doesn't break it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("shimmering aurora that pulsed like a slow, celestial heartbeat"), some abstract phrasing around "emergent compass," and slight register drift in academic terms like "mycelial networks." No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The forest election concept and taste-based navigation system offer genuine freshness. The reframing of personal storms as archives rather than burdens transforms familiar weather-as-emotion metaphors. The synthesis of environmental democracy with human emotional burden creates an original premise executed with commitment.</comment>
