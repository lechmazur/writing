<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The librarian's obsessive pursuit creates clear motivation, with her decades-long search for the runaway dream driving concrete choices. The moment of reunion ("the child, now grown, standing beside her") lands with earned emotional weight, though the resolution's abstract quality ("translucent but solid") slightly softens the cost that should be more visceral at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the piece builds through layered descriptions of light-capturing toward the final reunion. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the dream manifests as presence rather than memory, with cost visible in the decades of searching. However, the exact nature of the transformation ("translucent but solid, real in the way only reclaimed absences can be") remains somewhat conceptually vague rather than dramatically concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The archipelago setting actively constrains the search through "fog-choked coves and tide-locked caves," while the light-palette functions as both tool and setting element that enables the final capture. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("salt-damp sand," "moon-pools," "jasmine and ozone"), with the northernmost jetty providing the specific location for resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming the lost dream—is signaled early and pursued consistently, with escalation through the three-component light formula (blush of first love, gold of loss, indigo of surrender). The cost manifests in decades of searching, though the actual confrontation lacks dramatic pressure as the dream simply "unfurls" once the formula is complete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of longing as tangible pursuit emerges organically through the light-capturing method and culminates in "Longing is the only map that never lies." The final image of closing the palette "not to store, but to savor" resonantly reweights the entire search, though the abstract nature of the reunion slightly diminishes thematic impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines lyrical precision ("whispering archipelago like a tide pulled by unseen moons") with inventive world-building vocabulary ("dream-vellum," "salt-crusted journal"). The perceptual signature remains consistent throughout, with controlled rhythm that accelerates toward the capture moment, though occasional density ("real in the way only reclaimed absences can be") borders on overwrought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose maintains high information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in world-building passages that simultaneously advance plot and atmosphere. Some metaphorical density in peak moments ("luminous absence—filled, at last") approaches overwriting but remains legible. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph structure support momentum throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of a librarian who captures light to vitalize dreams offers genuine originality, with the watercolor palette reimagined as a light-gathering device being particularly fresh. The synthesis of archival work with dream-hunting creates a non-obvious angle, and the risk of sustaining this lyrical-fantastical register pays off through coherent world-building. The specific mechanics of light-capture (dawn at 5:47 a.m., "amber of yearning") elevate beyond template fantasy.</comment>
