<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The embroiderer's motivation to decode hidden truths through thread drives consistent choices, with her disguised wisdom creating internal tension between appearance and reality. Her synchronization with the flame shows embodied response to pressure, and her final choice to intervene carries visible cost through risk and exhaustion. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("not from fear, but from synchronization complete") rather than fully embodied moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with patterns building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where her intervention saves the prince and transforms the observatory's purpose. The eternal flame's resonance with adjacent possibilities provides a persistent constraint that shapes her tactics throughout. Cost is visible in her exhaustion and the risk she takes, though the final transformation could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory and eternal flame function as active constraints—the flame's tremors guide her needle's path and the observatory becomes both workplace and battleground. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("amber leaves scraped...like fingernails on slate"). The silk galaxy charts and aurora tapestries provide tactile, lived-in detail that supports the magical realism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of preventing the coup escalates through the flame's violent shuddering, her discovery of the conspiracy's specifics in the adjacent layer, and her race to weave counter-patterns before the assassins arrive. Her agency drives the resolution through strategic deception. The tightening when conspirators seize the observatory creates genuine pressure, though the resolution feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between perceived foolishness and hidden wisdom, with the needle serving as both literal tool and metaphor for subtle intervention. The final image of her "needle still moves" resonates as continuous vigilance. The story earns its meditation on how wisdom need not shout to win through concrete dramatization rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature focused on textile and cosmic imagery. Some register elevation in peak moments ("echo-chamber of almost-was") fits the magical realism but occasionally strains. The voice maintains its lyrical quality throughout without becoming purple, though some phrases approach overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, but several instances of elevated diction and near-repetitive phrasing ("silent as a shadow slipping between shelves"). Some metaphorical density in high-pressure beats without clear payoff. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting ("frozen tear," "fingernails on slate") doesn't always serve pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of embroidery as divination through synchronization with adjacent realities offers genuine freshness, transforming the typical prophecy trope through textile craft. The specific detail of using aurora strands and flame resonance to navigate parallel possibilities shows imaginative world-building. The quiet victory through perceived foolishness subverts expectations effectively.</comment>
