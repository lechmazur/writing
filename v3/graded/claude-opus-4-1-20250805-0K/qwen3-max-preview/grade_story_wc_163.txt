<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to find belonging through environmental communion is embodied through concrete actions (touching algae, pressing palm to glass, ascending with purpose). The internal journey from disconnection to belonging-with-solitude lands with earned resonance, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("rhythm of belonging"). The firefly encounter crystallizes her values through action—choosing connection over documentation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the protagonist's shift from seeking to carrying belonging upward—a clear before/after with emotional cost paid through solitary descent and patient observation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the firefly convergence that reweights her isolation into purposeful solitude. Cost is visible in the burnt feather's transformation from "ending" to "beginning."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The underwater facility functions as more than setting—its decay patterns, pressure gauges, and shattered observatory dome constrain movement and enable discovery, particularly when fireflies mirror the reactor schematic. Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's astrologer perspective (constellations in algae, stars in saltwater). The environment actively shapes the final choice to surface "slowly" rather than escape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on the protagonist's need for belonging versus isolation, with meaningful deepening when fireflies reveal threshold possibilities beyond logic. The hand-mirroring gesture represents agency through attention rather than action, foreclosing the path of pure observation. Cost manifests in accepting solitude as the price of wonder-bearing witness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the facility's transformation from abandonment to "quiet purpose," with the burnt feather serving as a threshold detector that physically vibrates at world-boundaries. The firefly paradox (impossible yet present) embodies the story's central question about belonging through witnessing rather than possessing. Final image of dawn-water-ascent offers non-literal answer: belonging is "coaxed from thresholds."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through compounds ("shadowseam wonder," "seam-light") and marine-astronomical fusion ("drowned constellations," "submerged stars"). Perceptual signature stays consistent—the protagonist reads environments as texts and charts. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates effectively from wide observatory view to intimate palm-press.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("kelp and coral framing the abyssal sky" = setting + atmosphere + worldview). Some figurative density in places ("shadowseam wonder" appears twice), but rhythmic control during the firefly encounter accelerates appropriately. Minor template moments ("She smiled," "She whispered") but propulsion remains strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of "landscape astrologer" reading underwater ruins as celestial maps offers genuine freshness, avoiding typical diver/explorer tropes. The fireflies-underwater impossibility provides non-obvious angle on belonging through witnessing paradox. Risk-taking in the quiet, contemplative closure pays off by avoiding forced epiphany.</comment>
