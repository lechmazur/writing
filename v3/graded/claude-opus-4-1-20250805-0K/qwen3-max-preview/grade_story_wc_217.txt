<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to find beauty in the incomplete drives consistent micro-choices through concrete actions (gathering torn paper, weaving fragments). The boy's transformation from hollow-eyed to curious shows earned change through specific experience. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around beauty/incomplete that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the boy's acceptance of "differently" flying kite with visible emotional cost (grief acknowledged) landing in laughter. Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases from lagoon description through kite repair to final "gloriously, tenderly, incomplete." Cost is legible in the boy's hollow eyes transforming to curiosity to joy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon and wet sand constrain movement and provide materials (torn paper, bamboo). Drake's feather functions as micro-setting that charges the repair scene. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from shoreline to dunes to water's edge. Setting doesn't quite reach 9+ as environment could more directly shape the tactical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty in brokenness) escalates from Elira's solitary practice to active intervention with the boy. The kite's transformation from broken to "crooked/glorious" deepens the thematic pressure with visible cost in accepting imperfection. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions: weaving fragments into asymmetrical kite, drake shedding feathers to fly lighter. Final image of "jubilant ghost" kite reweights all prior broken/incomplete imagery. The "snapped strings carry wind's memory" line resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elira reads ripples "like braille," hears "breath between waves." Consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm shifts during repair scene. Brief dialogue natural and subtext-rich ("Differently"/"That's enough"). Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("burnished hush") that slightly strains POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (description advancing character and theme). Some figurative density in opening that borders on overwriting ("bruised sky," "spilled ink," "salt-cured silence"). Clean syntax variety and purposeful paragraph lengths. Deduction for elevated register phrases that occasionally drift from POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh angle on broken/beautiful through specific "woven dawns" practice of remaking rather than fixing. Drake's feather as compass for letting go offers non-obvious wisdom. The asymmetrical patched kite as resolution avoids tidy redemption. Somewhat familiar territory of finding beauty in imperfection limits higher scoring.</comment>
