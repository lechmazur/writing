I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds density through layered imagery and pattern recognition rather than strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The copyist's motivation crystallizes through embodied details—ink-stained fingers, tears as catalyst, her progression from scribe to broadcaster. The transition from passive transcription to active transmission earns its emotional weight through accumulated specificity, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("thistled calm settling in her bones").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she becomes broadcaster rather than receiver, with visible cost in her tears and waiting. The accumulative structure coheres through the radio's secret glow as persistent constraint, and the pattern-teaching of dust-to-story resurrection justifies the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ember alcove functions as micro-setting that constrains her work to night hours and provides the embers that respond to her tears. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—the radio's heat rather than light, mist as velvet, dust swirling into miniature theaters—each detail advancing the story-resurrection concept.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from personal rebellion to collective resurrection as she discovers the network of scribes. The radio's increasing heat provides escalation, and her tears as "final catalyst" creates meaningful cost, though the middle section could tighten between discovery and action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete system of dust-memories, pirate broadcasts, and tears as activation. The final image of waiting for another alcove to warm offers a non-literal answer about artistic persistence during cultural famine without stating its moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm ("ember alcove, mist curling") and selective perception focused on tactile/thermal rather than visual. The perceptual signature—tracking warmth, transcribing ephemera—remains distinct throughout, though occasional abstractions ("thistled calm") slightly dilute specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The glow guided her—not with light, but with heat, a secret beacon against the famine's chill"). Some figurative density in places ("mist curling at the threshold like a sigh") but serves the accumulative mode rather than obscuring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The secret radio network of story-resurrectionist scribes offers fresh synthesis of familiar elements. The specific mechanics—tears as activation, warmth as signal strength, dust particles forming story-theaters—create an inevitable-feeling system. Risk-taking in the lyric density pays off (+0.3).</comment>
