<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ghost's synesthetic perception creates distinctive interiority ("the laugh was cerulean with flecks of brass"), and her final choice to dissolve into the orchard shows agency with visible cost. However, the secondary characters remain sketches rather than pressure sources, and some emotional transitions feel summative rather than embodied ("She smiled" lacks specificity during a pivotal recognition).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration—the ghost transforms from seeking encores to enabling others' performances, with clear cost (her dissolution). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks and density increases. Minor deduction for soft orientation ("the business" remains vague) but the mystical setting teaches its rules early enough to support the fantastical logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard's fractured timeline ("blossoms from spring brushed shoulders with autumn's rotting fruit") constrains and enables the ghost's final choice, and sensory details are filtered through her synesthetic lens effectively. The hedge maze and fountain serve as active settings that shape possibility. Slight deduction for occasional generic phrasing ("mystical orchard garden") but the setting-as-character largely succeeds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—luring possibility from despair—progresses through the ghost's discovery of the cerulean laugh thread and culminates in her sacrifice. The tarot coin compass creates genuine pressure by pulling her toward "intersections where hope still whispered." However, the escalation relies more on accumulation than decisive tightening, and the three human echoes feel somewhat mechanical in their parallel structure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the transformation of performance from individual glory to enabling others' courage—the ghost's dissolution seeds future artists. The final image of the silver-bark sapling with chiming blossoms offers resonant non-literal answer to whether art transcends death. Minor deduction for the slightly neat resolution of the three human storylines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic rendering and theatre metaphors ("echoes of applause, gasps, and curtain calls"). The lyrical register maintains consistency and supports the fantastical premise. However, some passages drift toward purple prose ("twilight," "half-remembered aria"), and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("She felt the pull").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, and the prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("her voice turned grief into lilac mist"). However, template cadence appears in the three-echo sequence, some metaphors strain ("threading her essence through time's fraying edges"), and occasional paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("The ghost's form thinned, her edges blurring").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synesthetic ghost-artist who transforms from performer to enabler offers fresh specificity, particularly in how her sensory gift translates into afterlife abilities. The tarot coin as compass rather than currency shows ingenuity. Deduction for the somewhat predictable arc of self-sacrifice and the mechanical parallelism of the three human recipients.</comment>
