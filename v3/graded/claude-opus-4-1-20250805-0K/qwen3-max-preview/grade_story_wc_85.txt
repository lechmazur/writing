<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elira's internal contradiction between guilt over her forgeries and the need to discover truth drives genuine character pressure, with her final transformation from fabricator to truth-sifter earned through the father revelation. The embodied reaction (vomiting into surf) and the physical detail of the watch hand's behavior avoid emotional abstraction. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution where she immediately knows her new path without struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the sieved hush concept organizing how truth fragments wash ashore and must be filtered. The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elira transforms from guilt-ridden forger to truth-sifter, with visible cost in her physical reaction and the weight of carrying her father's sacrifice. The orientation anchors effectively (cobalt terrace, Elira, dusk) and causality holds as discovery leads to transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The driftwood carvings function as micro-setting that constrains choice—Elira must physically sift through them to access truth, and specific carvings (mother with empty cradle, father's figure) charge the discovery. The cobalt terrace bookends the piece effectively, shifting from "cold" to "closure." The shore's mythology of truth washing up in fragments integrates setting with theme rather than mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the weight of withheld truth—deepens through accumulation as Elira moves from general seeking to the specific revelation about her father's sacrifice vs. abandonment. The cost manifests physically (vomiting) and psychologically (carrying truth as "ballast"). While the transformation is meaningful, the lack of active opposition or complication keeps this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sieved hush concept brilliantly emerges through concrete action—truth literally strained through wood grain and tide, making the abstract tangible. The theme of how truth must be "worn down by water, shaped by loss" before souls can hold it develops organically through the driftwood discovery. The final image of Elira becoming the sieve herself resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("cobalt terrace stretched like a bruise") and consistent metaphorical register around erosion/water/crafting. The perceptual signature shows Elira noticing through her genealogist's lens (bloodlines, parchment, forgery). Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction that slightly exceeds the established register ("sea-salt alchemy").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and purposeful rhythm, though some metaphorical density in peak beats ("tiles cool beneath bare feet" followed immediately by "stretched like a bruise"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for repetitive "She [verb]" openings in the final third and slight overwriting in places ("gnawed at driftwood carvings half-buried in salt and sand").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The sieved hush concept offers a fresh angle on truth-telling, transforming the cliché of "painful truth" into a physical process of erosion and filtering. The specific detail of a genealogist who forges family trees finding truth in driftwood carvings feels original. The synthesis of crafting (genealogy/carving) with natural erosion creates memorable specificity.</comment>
