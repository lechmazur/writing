<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation as reluctant medium for digital ghosts is clear and rooted in his bureaucratic erasure, with the heartbeat counting serving as a concrete embodiment of his liminal state. The porcelain shard functions as both tactile anchor and emotional tether, grounding his choices. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "fetching wisdom from failure" that could be more embodied in the peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through ink patterns and ghost defragmentation leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where ghosts achieve coherence rather than erasure. Cost is visible in Aris's acceptance of his hollow role and the sting of the porcelain shard. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in opening paragraphs. Slight deduction for the conceptual weight of "wisdom from failure" not fully dramatized in concrete terms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frost-feathered opal dome and buried observatory create atmospheric pressure, with cold marble and snowdrift functioning as physical constraints on movement and isolation. Sensory details (ozone/burnt sugar scent, fogged breath) emerge through POV filter effectively. The setting enables the ghost-harvesting protocol and shapes Aris's barefoot navigation through the crystalline chamber.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of retrieving/arranging corrupted data escalates through the ink's dendritic expansion and Dr. Voss's emergence, with Aris's agency manifested in initiating defragmentation and pressing the shard into his palm. The resolution shows ghosts "settled" rather than saved, with clear cost in Aris's continued liminal existence. Escalation could be stronger through more concrete obstacles during the defragmentation process.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of honoring error's residue emerges organically through the death certificate mistake creating Aris's unique position as ghost medium. The porcelain shard from his mother's last breakfast reweights from loss artifact to "quiet promise," and Dr. Voss's "failure isn't the end, it's the seam where truth leaks out" resonates without moralizing. Final image of Aris returning to a world that thinks him dead carries the theme without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice with lyrical compression ("frost feathered the glass like breath on a mirror") and specific perceptual signature (counting heartbeats, sensing ghost-voices as pressure/scent). POV remains stable in close third with controlled psychic distance. Some elevated diction ("dendritic veins," "cartography of lost data") fits the technical-mystical register but occasionally risks opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (setting/character/atmosphere), though some abstract phrasing around "ephemeral patterns" and "language of collapse and reassembly" edges toward opacity. Clean grammar and varied syntax support rhythm. Minor deduction for conceptual abstractions that could be more concrete, particularly in the defragmentation sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic error, digital ghosts, and defragmentation through spilled ink creates an original premise. The heartbeat counting and porcelain shard as grounding devices show specific invention. The concept of ghosts as "orphaned code" and defragmentation through ink patterns rather than traditional programming offers genuine novelty within the ghost story tradition.</comment>
