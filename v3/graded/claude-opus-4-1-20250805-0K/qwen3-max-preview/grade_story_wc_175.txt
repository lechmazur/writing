<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's devotion to ephemeral memorial-making is embodied through concrete actions (knotting, threading, bowing) with internal contradictions playing out in scene. The "transiently rooted" paradox drives consistent choices that build toward earned renunciation when she refuses to touch the monarch. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("truth lived in the ephemeral") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with Resonant Reconfiguration closure as the grotto achieves peace through witnessed dissolution. The piece teaches its pattern of temporary creation/dissolution early and pays it off with the monarch's benediction and the structure's planned unraveling. Cost is visible in the certainty of erasure ("By morning, rain would loosen the knots"). Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some abstract passages that momentarily blur the present frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto setting actively participates—ferns "curling inward as if shy," mist enabling/concealing departure, the ancient stump providing the shrine's foundation. The moth wing and monarch migration create temporal urgency (last of their line). Minor deduction for some generic nature descriptors ("verdant," "gold-green") that don't fully exploit the specific ecology.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through the ritual's progression toward completion and the knowledge of imminent dissolution. The monarch's arrival creates a test of her discipline (not touching = preserving sacrament). Cost is legible in accepting erasure over permanence. Deduction for relatively static middle section where pressure plateaus rather than intensifying.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of honoring the ephemeral emerges through concrete action—building to dissolve, bowing without touching, creating without audience. The final image of the grotto "finally, at peace" resonantly reweights the entire ritual as successful precisely through its impermanence. Strong subtext in the moth wing/monarch parallel (ghost honoring ghost).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signature ("blushing stillness," "velvet dark of collective amnesia"). Rhythm modulates effectively between meditative passages and precise ritual actions. Deduction for occasional register elevation that strains against the contemplative voice ("collective amnesia," "sacrament into souvenir").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("embers caught in slow wind," "knot memory into the living world"). However, abstract passages create momentum drag ("truth lived in the ephemeral, in what vanished before it could be claimed") and some template repetition in "She [verb]" constructions. The phrase "transiently rooted" appears three times with diminishing returns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of ephemeral memorial-making through dissolution offers a fresh angle on remembrance rituals. Specific synthesis of ecological observation (monarch migration) with philosophical practice. Deduction for relying on somewhat familiar meditation-on-impermanence territory without fully transforming it through lived detail.</comment>
