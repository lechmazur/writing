I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through lyric accumulation rather than causal plot mechanics, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where courage is reconceptualized as patient waiting rather than bold action.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Characters operate more as archetypal vessels than individuals, but their collective mission reveals consistent motivation through embodied details like Elira's metronome clicking and Torvin's bark-listening. The final reframing of courage as "reserved—for when the leash breaks" earns the closure through accumulated gestures rather than dramatic change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the discovered artifacts (shoe, whistle) that reweight courage from action to patience. However, the orientation remains deliberately vague past 120 words ("veiled ridgeways" never anchors spatially), costing -0.4, though this serves the dreamlike accumulation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("salt and silence on their tongues"), with the ridgeway functioning as psychological terrain more than physical space. The star-punch holes creating "tiny perforations leaking quiet light" effectively transforms setting into spiritual architecture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stakes center on finding "unused courage," which deepens through discovery of the artifacts rather than escalating through conflict. The piece maintains coherent pressure through accumulation, but the abstract nature of the quest ("courage doesn't rust") limits felt urgency compared to more concrete stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through accumulated images—the broken leash, star-punches marking "thresholds crossed in spirit," abandoned artifacts of "halted bravery." The final gesture of punching stars into doorframes offers a non-literal answer about courage's patient persistence without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent mythic-lyric register with controlled rhythm ("not rescue, nor reprimand—it was pilgrimage"). Some elevated diction borders on purple ("moon-bathed ferns," "salt-laced zephyrs") but serves the fable-like tone. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose flows with purposeful cadence and varied syntax, though occasional overwriting appears ("twisted like question marks," "soft, watchful, tender as a mother's hand"). Some template repetition in "They [verb]" constructions (-0.4) but information density remains high through compressed imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The reconceptualization of courage as patience and reservation rather than action offers genuine freshness. The star-punch as threshold-marker and the indirect pilgrimage structure create memorable specificity within the quest-fable frame.</comment>
