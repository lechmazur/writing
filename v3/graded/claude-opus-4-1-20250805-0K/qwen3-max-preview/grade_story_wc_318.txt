<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's grief-driven compulsion is powerfully embodied through specific actions (conducting absence, clutching the pull cord handle) with visible cost. Internal contradiction between hope and loss acts simultaneously in scene, particularly in moments like dropping to his knees when hearing the full-bellied laugh. Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("mournfully eager" repeated) rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Earned Stasis closure - the protagonist's nightly ritual represents endurance with visible cost (neighbors' judgment, emotional toll). The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and builds density through layered imagery. Cost is legible in "refusing to let joy's memory rot in silence" and the ongoing price of grief work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tunnel functions as active setting that constrains and enables - its acoustics literally shape what's possible (echoes, harmonics). Strong micro-setting work with the gutted leaf blower as vessel. Spatial choreography clear throughout, though some description tends toward the abstract rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative deepening - from conducting machines to conducting absence to conducting "the unsung, the unlaughed." The dominant stake (preserving joy's memory against silence) intensifies through pattern and repetition. Cost is visible in his isolation and the emotional price of each nightly ritual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of conducting absence/echo as grief work. The ending offers a resonant answer without stating a moral - "even ghosts deserve lullabies" and "time doesn't end—it echoes." The recurring motif of the pull cord handle as rosary/pendulum meaningfully constrains choice and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression. The perceptual signature is consistent - everything filtered through grief's lens. Some elevated diction ("macerates grief") fits the conductor's artistic sensibility, though occasionally brushes against purple prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with purposeful repetition that builds resonance ("He sings to the walls. He sings to the wind."). Information density high in most passages. Deduction for template cadence in places ("He knows... They see... They hear...") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The leaf blower conductor concept offers a fresh angle on grief narrative. Specific synthesis of suburban mundane (leaf blower) with artistic sublime (symphony conductor) feels non-obvious. The transformation of mechanical tool into spiritual vessel shows genuine ingenuity, though grief narratives themselves are familiar territory.</comment>
