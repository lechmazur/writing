<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and consistent throughout—she seeks to resurrect ruins through "redirected flows" rather than traditional restoration, with this principle driving every action from steam redirection to kinetic tiles. Her internal state shows genuine complexity in how she processes decay as variables in equations, though some passages drift toward abstraction ("stoic wonder" feels more labeled than embodied). The final choice to continue rather than leave demonstrates earned progression with visible cost in her exhaustive dedication.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered interventions (steam redirection, sextant mounting, kinetic tiles) that build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the terminal "learns how to breathe again." Cost is visible in the terminal's persistent decay ("walls still cracked") and Elira's ongoing commitment. The equation H = Σ(ΔI • R) provides conceptual closure but feels slightly forced; the piece would be stronger letting the accumulated details speak without the formula.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The terminal setting actively shapes every choice—from the ruptured geothermal line enabling steam redirection to the skeletal spire housing the sextant. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from upper concourse to Sub-Level 3 to cargo annex, with each location offering specific materials and constraints. The setting evolves causally as interventions accumulate (fogged windows, LED strips, visitor footsteps), though some descriptions edge toward the ornate ("prismatic shards across the marble floor").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether decay can be transformed through redirection rather than restoration—deepens through escalating interventions that each require more complex engineering. The geothermal discovery creates a genuine turn that forces adaptation of method. However, there's no meaningful opposition or risk; everything Elira attempts succeeds without setback, reducing tension despite the conceptual elegance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between "brute force" restoration and Elira's philosophy of "redirected flows," with each intervention demonstrating this principle concretely. The locals' gradual return (astrophysicist, muralist, child) shows community reformation without forcing the point. The final image of "learning how to breathe again" resonates with earned transformation, though the mathematical equation feels like unnecessary thematic scaffolding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent technical-poetic register appropriate to an engineer who "mapped stress fractures like poetry," with specialized vocabulary ("load-bearing ghosts," "kinetic tiles") grounding the voice. The perceptual signature is distinct—Elira sees angles, flows, and variables where others see ruin. However, some passages drift into overwrought territory ("whispered in graffiti by squatters"), and the narrative occasionally tells what could be shown.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is generally high with most sentences advancing multiple layers (character, setting, theme), particularly in action sequences like the steam redirection. However, several passages contain conceptual loops ("maze of intentions" repeated without development) and abstract philosophizing that slows momentum. The prose occasionally strains for effect with mixed metaphors ("breath returned to a corpse") that don't quite land.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of engineering-as-poetry and treating decay as design variables offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic renewal stories. The specific synthesis of technical precision with artistic sensibility feels original, especially in details like using a sextant to measure structural rather than celestial angles. The transformation of abandoned infrastructure through redirection rather than demolition provides genuine freshness, though some elements feel derivative of solarpunk aesthetics.</comment>
