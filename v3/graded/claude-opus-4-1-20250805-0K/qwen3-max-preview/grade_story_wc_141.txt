I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and resonant objects toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the myth buster accepts living beside riddles rather than solving them.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation crystallizes through embodied grief (sister's loss at sea) and her compulsive need to decode meaning through physical rituals. Internal contradiction operates beautifully in scene—she reimagines conversations while knowing they're false, pursuing answers she simultaneously creates. The final choice to stop seeking answers in ghosts shows earned transformation with visible cost (shattering of compass/shell).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost: the myth buster releases her obsessive quest, accepting riddles "to live beside, not solve." The accumulative structure coheres as each ritual layer (shell whispers, cello hums, compass spins) builds toward the revelation that silence itself is what she's buried. Cost is visible in the shattering of her tools and the acceptance of permanent loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned observatory functions as more than backdrop—its "shattered telescope glass" and "cracked domes" mirror the protagonist's fractured pursuit of cosmic answers. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (wind as "choir of forgotten astronomers"). The setting doesn't quite constrain choices at the 9+ level, but it effectively pressures the emotional landscape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding grief's riddle—deepens through accumulative pressure as each ritual attempt (retelling, shell-to-cello transfer, compass reading) fails to provide answers until the revelation pivots inward. The final realization that "What do you bury when you refuse to speak?" reweights all prior seeking. Cost manifests in the destruction of her sacred objects.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of reimagined conversations and physical objects, never stated directly until earned through action. The central question—how we revise memory to bear loss—develops through concrete particulars (painted seashell, half-finished cello). The ending's acceptance of unsolvable riddles offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire quest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains lyric control throughout, with purposeful compression ("gloomy cheerfulness...threadbare but warm") and rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The perceptual signature is highly specific—only this myth buster would describe wind as a "choir of forgotten astronomers" or see dialogue as capable of being "polished by regret." No head-hopping, clean focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the cello balanced between her knees, the painted seashell resting on its bridge like an offering to the void"). Figurative language serves purpose without overwhelming ("sound like cracked bells tumbling down stone stairs"). Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("the riddle breathing") but overall strong propulsion and zero loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief-ritual through reimagined conversations channeled into musical resonance offers a fresh angle on loss. The specific combination of painted seashell, unfinished cello, and ephemeral compass as tools for processing grief feels organic and memorable. The ending's pivot from solving to accepting riddles subverts the myth-buster archetype meaningfully.</comment>
