I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - The piece builds through layered memories, rhythmic polishing, and sensory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where stillness becomes shared light.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma (village burning), with concrete embodied details like "knees creaking like old timber." The internal conflict between exile and service manifests through specific actions (polishing as rebellion). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("pearl of stillness") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where polishing transforms grief into shared light, with visible cost ("knees creaking," years of exile). The accumulative lens holds consistently through memory layers and rhythmic action. The transformation from "earthbound star watcher" to light-sharer lands with earned weight. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The grotto functions as active setting that constrains choice (hidden location enables her work) and charges the final image through prismatic light effects. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("mist curled like sleeping dragons"). The condensation and water actively participate in creating the light display, making environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure as polishing becomes metaphor for processing trauma. The dominant stake (sharing light without fire) intensifies through memory layers. Cost is visible in physical toll and years of isolation. One meaningful deepening occurs as the glass transforms from personal vow to communal healing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the polishing metaphor: transformation through patient erosion rather than violent change. The ending offers a resonant answer without stating a moral - the child's "like holding sky" crystallizes the theme. Subtext operates effectively through the fire/light dichotomy and the grandmother's pearl metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("memories resurfaced—not in shards, but in tides"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains POV credibility ("serpentine grotto," "zephyr bloomed"). Psychic distance shifts are intentional and serve emotional beats, though a few passages lean toward purple prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. However, repetitive phrase structures appear ("She had," "She would") creating template cadence in places. Some metaphorical density in high-pressure beats ("pearl of stillness") without full payoff. The prose maintains momentum but occasional overwriting ("reflectively vibrant" used three times) creates minor drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The central concept of polishing as healing method is fresh, transforming the revenge narrative into patient resistance. The specific detail of sea glass as catalyst for communal healing avoids generic trauma resolution. Minor deduction for some familiar mystical grotto imagery, though the mist-as-breath detail adds originality.</comment>
