<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vey's transformation from bureaucrat to curator of echoes shows clear internal progression with embodied details like the heart beating "only when emotion surged." The final choice to summon rather than sell demonstrates earned character change with visible cost (years of arrhythmic existence).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Vey's shift from counting seconds to curating echoes reweights the entire premise with felt cost. The capsule opening and urn fusion create causal momentum toward understanding time's texture rather than fixing it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald silo's humming walls and salt flat isolation establish immediate atmosphere, while sensory details like "scent of rain and old paper" ground pivotal moments. Setting constrains choice through the silo's resonance with the urn, though some descriptions edge toward ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from personal (Vey's timeless heartbeat) to collective (summoning others through garage sale listings), with the urn fusion forcing irreversible change. Cost is visible in Vey's years of arrhythmic existence, though escalation could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of time as accumulation rather than passage emerges organically through concrete images—the urn's "echoes," translucent moments, garage sale descriptions. The final insight that time "accumulates. Like dust. Like love" reweights all prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice through inventive compounds ("borrowed-time timekeeper") and perceptual signature (numbers whispering textures). Some passages drift toward elevated register ("translucent figures—not ghosts, but moments") that slightly strain the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery like "cracked open the earth like an old book," but occasional overwriting ("grit of joy, the silk of sorrow, the chalk of regret") and template listing in the translucent figures sequence. Information density is high but some metaphor strings edge toward purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Great Recalibration's transformation of numbers into textures offers genuine conceptual freshness, while the garage sale listings as temporal summons demonstrate inventive world-building. The synthesis of time-as-accumulation with physical artifacts feels earned and non-obvious.</comment>
