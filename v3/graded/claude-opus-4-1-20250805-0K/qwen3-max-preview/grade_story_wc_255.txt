<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's colorblindness as synesthetic perception ("green wasn't green to him, but the damp velvet of moss") creates distinctive interiority, and his philosophy of finding beauty in imperfection drives concrete choices like arranging plants by texture rather than color. The barter system reveals character through action, though Marta's transformation feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through plant arrangements building to the courtyard's awakening. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Marta commits to "wake the kiln" with root and rust, showing transformation with clear cost (abandoning traditional glasswork). The reed tongue as resonator creates causal linkage between arrangement and awakening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The courtyard functions as active participant—"slumbering spirit" awakened through specific arrangements where "sage beside stonecrop steadies restless earth." Phoenix ash patterns, birdbath filling with mysterious dew, and shoots pushing through blackened soil create atmospheric pressure that constrains and enables choices throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from salvaging discarded materials to awakening dormant spirits, with the reed tongue discovery tightening pressure toward the courtyard's response. The shift from Elias teaching to Marta taking initiative with sunflower stalks shows meaningful escalation, though the transformation could use one more beat of resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—"bartered awakenings" manifest as actual exchanges that transform both parties, while the recurring motif of broken things "whispering their worth" gains resonance when green shoots emerge from ash. The final image of finding beauty in "what others called ruined" reweights all prior salvaging without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyric compression ("the phoenix had risen hours ago, leaving only ash-patterns") and synesthetic perception creating unique POV texture. Controlled psychic distance shifts between Elias's intimate perception and wider courtyard awareness serve the accumulative design without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("arms crossed, amused by his innocently cunning persistence" characterizes while advancing). Some figurative density in opening paragraph, but rhythm varies purposefully with shorter sentences during action ("The rosemary twitched") creating momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of environmental art, synesthesia, and mystical ecology feels earned through specific detail. The concept of communicating with place through arrangement rather than people transforms familiar "wounded healer" territory, with risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure paying off at closure.</comment>
