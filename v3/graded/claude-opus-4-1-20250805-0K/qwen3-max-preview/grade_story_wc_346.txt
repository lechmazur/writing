<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The adjuster's motivation through duty and compassion is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment through scarred fingers and crystallized tears. The puppet head functions as a meaningful external catalyst that shapes his choices. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("bruised awe swelling") in emotional peaks rather than fully embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the adjuster's completed duty transforms universal death into gentle sleep, with visible cost in the dissolution of everything. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, dusk, spiral stairs) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse constrains the adjuster's actions to its specific architecture and mechanisms, while the puppet head's physical details (cracked porcelain, dangling eye) charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the adjuster's focus on temporal/cosmic perception over mundane details. The nested patterns and clockwork create a lived-in occupational specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—making entropy gentle rather than violent—is signaled early and deepens through the activation of nested patterns that progressively still larger scales (sea, planet, constellation). Cost is visible in the world's dissolution and the adjuster's acceptance of his own ending. The tightening from personal duty to universal consequence forecloses all other options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete juxtaposition of broken beauty (puppet) with tender apocalypse, avoiding abstract statements. The final image of the eyeless puppet smiling into darkness offers a resonant answer about finding grace in endings. Subtext operates through the lullaby as both destroyer and comforter.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature filters cosmic events through musical/mechanical metaphors ("fractal lullabies," "each gear a stanza"). Purposeful compression and lyric density serve the accumulative design. Some elevated diction ("vouchsafe," "entropy's curtain") fits the mythic register though occasionally strains naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with most lines carrying multiple functions, and the prose maintains momentum through varied syntax. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("bruised awe swelling in his chest"), some abstract phrasing ("nested patterns—fractal lullabies woven into clockwork spirals"), and filter constructions that could be more immediate. The closing sequence achieves strong propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic clockkeeper with lullaby-singer offers a fresh angle on apocalyptic fiction, avoiding both nihilism and false hope. The puppet head as witness/catalyst is specific and memorable. Some familiar end-times imagery (frozen gulls, stilled waves) prevents higher scoring despite the original emotional calculus of tenderness in destruction.</comment>
