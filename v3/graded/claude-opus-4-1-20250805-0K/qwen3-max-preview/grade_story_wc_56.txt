<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The seeker's motivation to "understand the architecture of lies" drives consistent micro-choices through water-touching, patient waiting, and locket retrieval. Internal contradiction emerges effectively between his trained stillness and the pull toward discovery. The final renunciation of "chasing legends" for "honoring quiet ruins" shows meaningful change with visible cost—he carries the locket's weight rather than proof.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward the locket discovery and inscription reveal, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where understanding replaces pursuit. The cost is legible in "carrying not proof, but peace"—a foreclosed path to traditional legend-seeking. Orientation anchors clearly (seeker, canal, twilight) and the pattern of patience-over-action teaches early through the sundial consultation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The canal setting constrains choice effectively—the seeker must wait for water to still, angle the sundial just right, reach at the precise moment. Sensory detail filters through his professional lens ("moss-slicked edge," "silt," "violet light"). The locket as micro-setting object charges the final understanding, though broader environmental pressure could deepen.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on understanding versus deception, with meaningful deepening when the locket's inscription reframes lies as "architecture erected to keep love from crumbling." The seeker's agency drives the patient waiting and deliberate retrieval. Cost is visible in abandoning the hunt for legends—"his purpose no longer to chase" forecloses his former path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the locket's inscription "Forgive me. I needed you to be perfect" which reweights all prior material about lies as protective structures. The architectural metaphor (buttresses, vaulted ceilings, stained glass) develops consistently without explicit moralizing. The ending image of "quiet ruins from which [legends] rise" offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows in how the seeker reads angles rather than hours, feels "temperature of forgotten time," distinguishes "not fish, not current, but intention." Voice maintains lyric control with purposeful repetition ("not... but" constructions) that builds accumulative pressure. Some elevated diction ("gloaming," "serene upheaval") fits the contemplative POV though occasionally brushes against over-writing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density strong with lines doing multiple jobs—"brass worn smooth by generations who trusted shadows more than clocks" delivers object detail, history, and thematic setup simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak moments ("cathedral" of quiet, "tuned strings") but coherent to the architectural theme. Minor repetitive stems in "He had..." openings but pattern serves accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on truth-seeking through "architecture of lies" metaphor that develops into protective structures rather than deceptions. The sundial measuring "angles of memory" rather than time shows original thinking. Risk-taking in the quiet, contemplative approach to legend-seeking pays off, though familiar mentor-student dynamic prevents higher scoring.</comment>
