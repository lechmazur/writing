<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inspector's motivation is clear and consistent—dissolving isolation through the pearl's activation—with concrete embodied emotion (weeping from recognition, bones vibrating). Internal conflict manifests through layered confessions that reveal contradictory impulses (envying the dead while seeking connection). The transformation from seeker to conduit is earned through accumulated confessions, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("the fragile pause between fear and surrender").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught spiral confession mechanism that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the inspector becomes a conduit. The pearl's dissolution and the inspector's/caves' glow constitute visible transformation with clear cost (vulnerability through confession). Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words (bunker inspector, crystal caves, seeking pearl).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Crystal caves function as more than backdrop—their "prismatic facets," "amethyst veins," and resonant properties actively participate in the transformation. The nautilus shell serves as crucial tool constraining the activation method. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from entrance through kneeling positions to final rising, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("trembling halos").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through deepening confessions that progressively increase vulnerability and cost—from hoping father didn't die alone to envying the dead. Each confession triggers intensified response (trembling→brightening→harmonic vibration), with the final crowning act foreclosing her previous isolation. The pearl's activation method creates genuine constraint requiring emotional exposure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the spiral confession structure—isolation as "the true apocalypse" reversed through vulnerable connection. The pearl mirrors rather than stores hope, revealed through dramatized discovery not exposition. The ending reweights all prior material: walls dissolving "like salt in warm water" pays off the central metaphor without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and perceptual signature ("the rhythm of the earth's slow breath"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains POV credibility ("logarithmic curve perfect for holding truth"), but compression and patterned repetition serve the accumulative design. The lyric mode maintains consistency through varied psychic distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with most lines serving multiple functions, though occasional overwriting appears ("the fragile pause between fear and surrender"). Strong propulsion through confession sequence with effective paragraph variation. Some metaphorical density in non-peak moments ("cathedral of compression") without clear payoff, and minor register elevation that doesn't fully match the inspector's established voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic and mystical elements through specific mechanism (confessions etched in spiral). The pearl as repository of "abandoned hopes" transforms familiar quest structure. The inspector's bureaucratic role subverted for emotional purpose shows genuine ingenuity, though some conceptual abstractions ("latent radiance") remain somewhat generic.</comment>
