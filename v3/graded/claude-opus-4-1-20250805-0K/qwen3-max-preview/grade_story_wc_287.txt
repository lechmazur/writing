<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's transformation from tending plants to reflecting light demonstrates clear internal progression with embodied emotion ("knees aching, palms smudged"). The backstory about her brother's death effectively motivates her actions without overwhelming the present. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("not wistfully, but with the quiet certainty") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist's act of installing prisms transforms the neighborhood's capacity for wonder, with visible cost in her physical exhaustion and the dying rosebush. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently as density builds through repeated prism placements. Slight deduction for the lockmaster's tooth metaphor taking time to clarify its thematic function.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fire escape setting actively constrains movement and provides the specific architecture needed for prism placement. Sensory details effectively filter through the gardener's professional eye ("cracked planters and stubborn soil"). The prisms transform space into active participant as moonlight fractures into neighborhood alleyways, directly enabling the story's closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen effectively from personal grief to community transformation, with the protagonist's agency driving each prism placement despite physical cost. The "quivering hush" builds appropriate tension that pays off in the neighborhood's awakening to wonder. Minor deduction for the conflict being primarily internal without significant external opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of reflecting light into dark corners, avoiding explicit moralizing. The lockmaster's tooth as measurement tool rather than key provides sophisticated subtext about gentle transformation. The final image of the city exhaling into dawn resonantly answers the story's question about finding beauty in fragility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature with the gardener noticing in botanical and mechanical terms ("bitting gauge tooth," "sagging awning"). Prose rhythm effectively modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in the oar-stroke metaphor. Some filter verb accumulation ("She knew," "She'd found") slightly dulls immediacy in places.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with effective variation in sentence structure and purposeful imagery. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("protected vulnerability" concept repeated, "quivering hush" reiterated without advancement). Some overwrought metaphors ("spilled mercury," "crimson sigh") approach purple prose without quite crossing into confusion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of a gardener becoming a light-reflector offers a fresh angle on urban renewal and grief processing. The specific synthesis of locksmithing metaphor with gardening creates non-obvious resonance. Slight deduction for the somewhat familiar "healing through helping others" arc, though the execution through prisms is distinctive.</comment>
