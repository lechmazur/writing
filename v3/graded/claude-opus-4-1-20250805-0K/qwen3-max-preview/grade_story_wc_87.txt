<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with contradictory impulses ("salt wind tangling her hair like unresolved equations," compass "mocking her"). The protagonist's transformation from precision-seeking navigator to acceptance of "imperfect motion" shows earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("merrily melancholic surrender") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where she becomes "the source of direction." Cost is legible in the forsaking of celestial precision for "imperfect motion." Deduction for late orientation (kayak launch clear, but temporal "when" arrives obliquely) and some causality softness in the middle transition from poles to kayak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Utility poles as makeshift stars effectively constrain choice and charge the final image. Strong sensory work ("salt wind," "boots crunched gravel," "crow dropped a rusted washer"). The kayak and compass function as micro-settings that shape tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding direction after collapse escalates through accumulation—naming poles, pocketing washer, finally paddling out. The pressure coheres under the textural lens with meaningful deepening when "compass needle finally stilled—not pointing north, but pointing toward her stern." Cost visible in accepting imperfect navigation over precision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of precision versus presence emerges organically through poles-as-stars metaphor and compass transformation. Strong resonance in final image where she needs "imperfect motion" rather than "perfect stars." Minor deduction for explicit thematic statement ("This was navigation by feeling, by fracture, by faith") that slightly over-articulates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("salt wind tangling her hair like unresolved equations"). Consistent perceptual signature of navigation metaphors throughout. Strong rhythmic control, particularly in the list structure of pole-naming and final crescendo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Deductions for repetitive "She [verb]" structures in several passages and some overwriting in metaphorical density ("merrily melancholic," "pilgrim," "barnacles shaken loose"). Information density high but occasionally tips into purple prose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on navigator-as-lost-soul with utility poles replacing stars. The specific detail of naming poles and the crow dropping a washer elevate beyond generic crisis narrative. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation pays off, though not groundbreaking.</comment>
