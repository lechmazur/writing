<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fiddler's transformation from playing bridge-songs to stepping forward "into the disbelief" shows earned change through specific action (playing for the hitchhiker, interpreting the glass flake, releasing attachment). Internal contradictions manifest through his dynamic observation versus his own frozen state, though peak moments lean toward abstract introspection rather than embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery layers (glass flake, scaffold flutters, pixelated amnesty) build toward the fiddler's permission to be remade. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he steps forward with "never" transformed from sentence to sculptable space, cost visible in "years" of stasis broken. Opening orientation is deliberately atmospheric but who/where/when anchors by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mountain pullout functions as more than backdrop—its mist swallows the hitchhiker, its granite face receives the fiddler's music, its ridge catches the shattered glass flake. Sensory detail filters through the fiddler's artistic perception (notes "spiraling upward," mountain "exhaling"). The scaffold flutters as physical map-fragments constrain interpretation and enable the final release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the fiddler's need to move beyond "never" into possibility, which deepens through accumulation rather than reversal—from playing for the hitchhiker through interpreting signs to releasing the glass flake. Cost appears in "years" of holding still and the "bridges he'd burned," though agency remains primarily observational until the final step forward.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of "pixelated amnesty"—forgiveness rendered in fragments rather than wholesale—emerges through concrete imagery (fractured glass, scaffold flutters with cryptic directions, shattered light). The ending reweights earlier static observation into active participation without stating a moral. The hitchhiker's transformation mirrors what the fiddler must accept for himself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lyric voice maintains consistent mystical register through selective perception ("silence pooled around him, thick as resin") and musical metaphors. POV control is clean with no head-hopping, though elevated diction occasionally strains ("dynamically observant," "pixelated amnesty"). The perceptual signature of a musician-mystic reading signs in fragments holds throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("mist like smoke through pine needles," "Permission to begin again, even if the beginning was cracked, fragmented, half-developed") but accumulates abstract loops around concepts of forgiveness and amnesty. Template structures appear ("He thought of...," "He felt...," "He knew...") and the extended reflection on pixelated amnesty in mid-story paraphrases rather than advances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of musical performance, photographic artifact, and construction debris into a system of fragmented forgiveness offers fresh inflection on redemption narratives. The scaffold flutters as cryptic wisdom-fragments ("Where the third note bends, turn left into silence") and the wet-plate collodion's ghostly incomplete image create specific texture beyond generic mysticism.</comment>
