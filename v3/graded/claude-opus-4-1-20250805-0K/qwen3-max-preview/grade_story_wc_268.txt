I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and recursive patterns toward a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist refuses the throne.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's contradictory impulses between justice and withdrawal manifest throughout, particularly in "She felt no triumph—only the hollow echo of justice delayed too long." Her final renunciation carries genuine cost as she refuses what her mission aimed to restore.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis when she refuses the throne with "I move where truth is forgotten, and leave before it is worshipped," foreclosing her path with visible cost. The accumulative structure coheres but the middle exposition about weeks passing dulls momentum between the library setup and the font revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The temple library functions as both setting and method—"Books lined the walls like tombstones" grounds the cryptic messaging system. The iron gall ink's chemical reaction with ancestral sigils provides specific, consequential detail that drives the revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual exile to systemic revelation as her distributed messages converge into collective witness. The pretender's unmasking through dissolved ink rather than force demonstrates agency through patience, though the weeks-long gap reduces immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The central metaphor "Truth is not a weapon. It is a mirror" crystallizes through action rather than assertion. The final line "The crown is not worn. It is carried" reweights sovereignty as burden rather than power, earned through her renunciation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice sustains mythic register with controlled rhythm: "crownless, voiceless, yet never powerless" uses triadic structure effectively. Perceptual signature emerges in how she reads the library: "each spine a silent sentinel."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose density serves the accumulative mode well: "She moved like ink bleeding through parchment" layers metaphor with plot mechanics. Some repetitive structures appear ("She did not..." patterns) but rhythm generally propels.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of truth-as-erosion rather than confrontation offers fresh angle on usurper narratives. The protagonist's refusal to rule after achieving justice subverts expectations, though the pretender remains somewhat generic.</comment>
