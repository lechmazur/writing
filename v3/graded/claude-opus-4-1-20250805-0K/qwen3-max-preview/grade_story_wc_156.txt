<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's methodical playfulness manifests through concrete actions (measuring decibel decay with a grin, humming counter-melodies) and her motivation evolves from professional restoration to personal transformation. The nested awakening sequence embodies internal contradiction as each layer strips away certainty, though the emotional progression could deepen further between revelation stages.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Elira literally absorbs the mural's frequencies, transforming from restorer to vessel. The cost is legible (loss of fixed identity, dissolution of professional certainty) though the middle section could tighten the discovery sequence for stronger causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden functions as active setting—brass petals tuned to specific frequencies, stone benches that amplify whispers—directly constraining how Elira must work. The synesthetic transformation (sound→shape→scent→story) grounds the fantastical in sensory specificity, and the garden's final rearrangement shows environmental response to character change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through the accumulative pattern: silence→single note→spiral→pressure waves→full absorption, with the hobo nickel's transformation marking the decisive shift. The stake (preserving certainty vs. embracing dissolution) crystallizes when Elira must choose to press the nickel into the mural, though middle beats could sharpen the cost of each awakening layer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The nested awakening concept operates both literally (the mural's layered revelation) and thematically (Elira's surrender of fixed identity), with the final image of the garden "waiting, in the pause between question and reply" resonating without stating a moral. The hobo nickel→river stone transformation embodies the theme of exchange and uncertainty replacing mastery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistent lyrical control with purposeful compression ("She didn't watch. She let the stories move through her") and selective perception that reflects Elira's professional focus shifting to wonder. Some passages edge toward elevated register ("the wild, trembling curiosity") but the perceptual signature remains distinct through synesthetic description.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The nickel's grooves, worn by thumb and time, caught stray sunlight and threw it sideways—not as light, but as sound"), though occasional abstract phrasing ("the self beyond self") could ground more concretely. Sentence variety and rhythm support the accumulative structure effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of sonic restoration that transforms the restorer inverts expected power dynamics, while the hobo nickel as tuning device offers fresh specificity. The synesthetic cascade (sound becoming shape, scent, story) and the garden's active participation create memorable texture beyond standard magical realism.</comment>
