<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal emptiness and performative grief create compelling contradictory impulses, particularly in the whittling-as-erosion metaphor and the calculated compliance performance. The final whispered "I miss you" reveals genuine feeling beneath the void, earning the closure with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through repetitive whittling, turbine imagery, and compliance theater, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where "perfectly compliant" carries the full weight of survival's cost. The orientation anchors early (farmhouse, porch, turbines) and the closure lands with undeniable emotional price in the gap between performance and truth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The turbines' "remade hush" and "mechanical lullaby" constrain every scene, creating engineered silence that shapes the protagonist's tactical choices. The farmhouse's "dust and damp insulation" and maintenance pauses provide stolen moments of true silence that enable resistance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates from initial retreat to Compliance Officer visits to the calculated box-presentation performance, each tightening the noose of mandated happiness. The cost is visceral in "Tomorrow, they'd begin again — lighter, emptier, perfectly compliant," where survival requires progressive self-erasure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ending's "perfectly compliant" reweights the entire narrative without stating a moral, revealing how grief becomes artifact and survival requires hollowing oneself. The dried bouquet's transformation from witness to sealed evidence to ghost resonates through every subsequent whittling stroke.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in the flat narration style ("Now, the knife meets grain. Resistance is minimal.") that mirrors emotional numbness. The POV maintains consistent distance and the rhythmic control heightens during compliance performances versus the brief break in true silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong information density, though some repetitive structures appear ("They whittled," "They'd," "They knew"). The "remade hush" and turbine descriptions effectively layer meaning, but occasional abstract phrases like "morally ambiguous, emotionally void" lean toward telling rather than embodying.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The Happiness Decree dystopia transforms grief-as-resistance through specific details like "Happiness Quotient uploads" and "Model Citizen Bulletin." The whittling-as-erosion metaphor and performance of mundane narration create fresh angles on emotional suppression.</comment>
