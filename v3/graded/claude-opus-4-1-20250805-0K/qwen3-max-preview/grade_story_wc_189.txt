<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tidal-pool chronicler's motivation crystallizes through embodied contemplation and micro-choices (placing the jade cicada, offering presence over answers). Her companion's hesitation creates genuine relational pressure. The "warmly observant" trait manifests in concrete perception rather than labels, though the final exchange edges toward mild emotional tidiness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Charged Poise closure lands cleanly—both characters crystallize in "the pause" with options legible and cost felt through the companion's "long and slow" exhale. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as impressions layer toward the insight about transition periods. Cost appears in "hesitation, human" and the unresolved migration question, though it could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The grotto's sensory detail (metronomic drips, wind's minor chord vibrating in molars) creates atmosphere while subtly constraining the scene to intimate observation. The jade cicada functions as micro-setting that charges the final understanding. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from pool to entrance to shared stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding time's texture through transition periods—deepens via the companion's arrival, forcing application of insight to their unresolved conflict. Escalation occurs through accumulation rather than reversal. The "warmly observant gaze" applied to him represents meaningful pressure, though cost could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images (paper boat, white rose, closing textbook) that embody threshold moments without stating morals. The jade cicada's metaphor of emergence/decay resonates without becoming heavy-handed. "Time...measured in the quality of attention" offers genuine insight earned through scene work rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice employs measured, lyrical cadence with sophisticated syntax ("cosmos wheeled in patient arcs"). Perceptual signature shows in how she processes through texture and periphery. Some elevated diction ("liminal," "metronomic") fits the chronicler's contemplative register, though occasionally risks purple territory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs (description advancing both atmosphere and character state). Rhythm varies purposefully between long contemplative sentences and short declarations. Minor repetition of "pause/transition" concepts and some abstract phrasing ("quality of attention") slightly dulls momentum without breaking it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tangential approach to understanding—"grazing destiny's periphery"—offers a fresh angle on prophecy/foresight. The grotto as contemplative space avoiding "human words" provides specificity. However, the resolution toward accepting transition feels somewhat expected given the setup, missing a truly surprising synthesis.</comment>
