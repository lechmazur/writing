<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's grief-driven motivation is powerfully embodied through concrete actions like polishing gems with whispered confessions and folding origami cranes with "unspoken names." The transformation from detached shadow to glowing crane represents earned change through accumulated cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("luminous torment") that could be more embodied, though the final choice to let the sapphire fall demonstrates clear agency with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure—Silas transforms his vessel of grief, releasing captured dreams to reunite with/transform the shadow into presence. Cost is visible in the shattering of all his work and the final letting go. Deductions for delayed orientation (floating isle context arrives late) and some causality softness in how exactly the shadow "drank dreams greedily" enables transformation, though the pattern coheres at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass basilica and floating tea garden create a vivid dreamscape where "gravity wept and time curled like steam." Setting actively constrains choices—the basilica's "central nave where ceiling opened to sky without stars" enables the final ritual. Strong sensory work with "cups that never cooled" and "paper wings catching thermals that flowed contrary to world's logic" charging the surreal atmosphere that supports theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on transforming grief, with one meaningful deepening when the basilica hums in a new key, forcing Silas's decisive action. The shadow's ascent into "hollows of memory" creates pressure that narrows options. Some softness in how the transformation mechanics work (shadow drinking dreams), but the cost is clear—destroying all his preserved memories to achieve presence rather than memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of grief from preserved/trapped (dreams in lanterns) to released/transformed (shadow becoming presence). The final image of inner light warming "more than glass" resonates without stating a moral. Strong subtext in "polishing not for beauty but to capture dreams" and the paradox of descending cranes that ascend. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("luminous torment") that could trust the imagery more.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with poetic compression ("fingers stained with soot and eyes that held glow of trapped embers") and controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The lyric mode is consistent, teaching its pattern early with paradoxes like "descended while ascending." Strong perceptual signature in how Silas notices through craft metaphors. Minor moments of elevated diction ("prismatic silence") that slightly exceed the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "gravity wept and time curled like steam from a teacup." Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("luminous torment—a glow that warmed nothing"), some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete, and slight register drift in peak moments ("satiation," "translucent"). The clarity at closure remains strong despite these minor frictions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-craft-transformation with specific details like polishing gems with "fingertip pressure calibrated to weight of a teardrop." The inverted physics (cranes falling upward, descending while ascending) create memorable non-obvious angles. The shadow as detached soul that transforms into presence shows genuine originality. Risk-taking with surreal logic heightens stakes while maintaining coherence through the accumulative pattern.</comment>
