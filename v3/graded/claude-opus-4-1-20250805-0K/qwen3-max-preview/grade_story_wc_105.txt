<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and deeply personal (sister's death driving the quest), with concrete embodied emotion throughout ("tears blurred her vision," "body thin from hunger"). The final choice to leave after harvesting the silence shows earned resolution with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority that could be more embodied ("marrow-deep instinct").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught synesthesia and absence-forging that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she creates the memory-catcher. The closure lands with felt cost ("weary but unbroken") and the final image of her departing with purpose reweights the opening quest. Slight deduction for delayed orientation anchors (greenhouse location clarified gradually) and some causality opacity around the forge mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse-forge-shipwreck setting actively constrains and enables her work, with the forge burning "absences" being essential to the story's logic. Vivid sensory detail filtered through her synesthetic perception ("violet of twilight as a whispering hum"). The environment participates in the closure as the "wrecks shifted—not physically, but sonically" when she succeeds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (capturing trust's breaking sound before others suffer) is signaled early and deepens through the forge work culminating in success. The cellular countdown adds time pressure ("every division a narrowing window"). The cost is visible in her physical state and the irreversible departure, though the middle lacks a sharp reversal or tightening moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of forging silence into guidance, avoiding abstract statements. The memory-catcher as "compass" rather than healing device shows mature thematic complexity. The final image of her leaving to help others reweights the entire piece without moralizing, though some passages edge toward abstraction ("alchemy of grief turned into guidance").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature with synesthesia consistently rendered ("colors faintly—the violet of twilight as a whispering hum"). Voice maintains poetic control without sacrificing clarity, with rhythm modulating during the forge sequence. The prose texture is specific and character-bound throughout with no head-hopping or distance breaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>High information density with most lines doing multiple jobs, strong rhythmic variation, and vivid specific language ("skeletal ribs of shipwrecks"). Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from the established register ("alchemy of grief," "harmonic dissonance"). No significant loops or scaffolding, though a few abstract phrases could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthesia, forge-of-absences, and memory-catching creates a genuinely fresh angle on grief and prevention. The specific detail of burning "hollows left by vanished laughter" and the sonic transformation of shipwrecks shows committed imaginative vision. Risk-taking in the conceptual forge mechanism heightens rather than obscures meaning (+0.3 within band).</comment>
