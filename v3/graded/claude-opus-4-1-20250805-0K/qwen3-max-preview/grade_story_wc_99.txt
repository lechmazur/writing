<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elio's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking the color of unspoken apologies through a ritualistic diffusion process. His internal state is embodied through physical gestures and sensory perception rather than labels. The final choice to continue his mission shows earned commitment with visible cost (the weight of absorbed regret).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where diffused regret transforms both the islet and Elio. The lace instructions create causal linkage between gesture and effect. Cost is visible in the "bruised indigo bleeding upward" and the juniper's new growth, showing transformation with price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The islet functions as active setting—its "shallow hollow" and "wind-sculpted pine" provide specific locations for the ritual. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("salt-laced wind," "damp stone and distant brine"). The juniper's new leaves directly respond to the diffusion, making environment inseparable from the closure's charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding/diffusing the color of regret) is signaled early and tightens through the ritual sequence. Escalation occurs through the lace instructions building to color manifestation. The cost is legible in the transformed landscape and Elio's acceptance of carrying this burden to other islets.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central image of "unspoken apologies" having color and weight that can be redistributed rather than erased. The final line "not to forget, but to breathe" offers a non-literal answer to handling regret. The juniper's response creates resonance without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm ("moved like silt settling") and perceptual signature (Elio notices botanical details, traces patterns). POV remains stable in close third. Diction matches the contemplative tone without register drift, maintaining consistency through the ritual's pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("brass tarnished by centuries of spectral salt"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("liturgical stole") that slightly exceeds necessity, but no loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a compass pointing toward regret rather than north is fresh. The lace as coded instructions for emotional diffusion transforms a domestic object ingeniously. The specific synthesis of bonsai master with grief cartographer feels non-obvious and earned.</comment>
