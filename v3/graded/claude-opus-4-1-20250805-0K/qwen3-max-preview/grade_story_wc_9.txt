<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer's internal journey from grief to grace shows strong embodied emotion ("fingers trembling," "breath ragged") and meaningful transformation. The motivation to recover lost time after her daughter's absence is clear and drives every choice. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in middle passages ("willingly perplexed" reads more as authorial label than lived experience).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with strong closure—the mother's descent and return creates a Resonant Reconfiguration where she transforms regret into active presence. The cost is visible: surrendering her grip on what cannot be held to regain what still can be. The orientation anchors (midnight glade, after the birth of silence) establish the metaphysical space early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The midnight glade above clouds functions as both literal and psychological space, constraining the ritual and enabling transformation. The saucer crack becomes a portal—setting as active participant. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("moss," "amber air," "silver mist") though occasionally tips toward the ornate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking lost time to confronting the archive of "unspent kisses" and "postponed lullabies," forcing the choice to release rather than reclaim. The transformation from "cartomancer" to "mother" shows clear cost. Slight reduction for the convenience of the child's voice appearing at the exact closure moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the central metaphor of time as something that accumulates rather than vanishes—"drawn upward by grief's quiet magnetism." The tracing ritual transforms from ward against oblivion to active blessing. The final image of setting the tea set again with presence rather than absence resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression, though occasionally strains toward elevated register ("choking beauty," "cloudbound repentance"). The perceptual signature is consistent—a grieving mother seeing through mystical lens. Some passages drift into overly ornate territory that slightly obscures immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, but figurative language appears too frequently in peak beats without clear payoff ("spectral hands," "roots rose like veins"). Some register drift into elevated diction ("archive of evaporated seconds") that doesn't fully match the intimate POV. The prose maintains momentum despite occasional overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of lost time accumulating in celestial spaces offers a fresh angle on grief and parental regret. The specific detail of birthday tablecloth tracings as family ritual feels authentic and particular. The transformation of a mystical quest into simple maternal presence shows originality, though some metaphysical elements feel familiar from literary fantasy.</comment>
