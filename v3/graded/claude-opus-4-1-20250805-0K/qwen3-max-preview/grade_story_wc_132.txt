<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal contradiction between scientific detachment and spiritual yearning drives genuine tension, with embodied emotion ("wept, quietly") and micro-choices revealing values under pressure. The transformation from observer to participant is earned through prior causality, though some interiority edges toward therapy-speak ("stop dissecting and start belonging").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the protagonist releases control and transforms from owner to participant, with visible cost (torn journal pages, abandoned scientific method). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks and cadence shifts that reweight the dominant stake. Minor deduction for slightly abstract phrasing around the metamorphosis concept ("reluctant in her").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mossy trellis and rain create atmospheric pressure that shapes choices (bringing microscope in storm, lying in mud). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("rain mingled with her tears," "emerald light"). The setting constrains the final transformation, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("bruised clouds").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as scientific observation fails to decode Lindy, forcing the protagonist to release intellectual control. The cost is legible (abandoning career identity, destroying research) and the final transformation reweights all prior observation. One meaningful deepening that changes knowledge occurs when Lindy glows in response to her surrender.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of metamorphosis applying to observer rather than observed. The final image of "conversation compatibility" and braided vines offers a non-literal answer to the question of human-nature relationship. Subtext operates through Lindy's persistence and the protagonist's "circuitously sincere" naming, avoiding direct moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in botanical observation ("chlorophyll-green defiance," "vegetal will") with controlled psychic distance shifts during the transformation sequence. Some register drift into academic abstraction ("photosynthetic sentience") that doesn't fully match the emotional arc. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with most lines advancing multiple layers, though some paraphrase loops appear ("stopped trying to fix"/"stopped dissecting"). Rhythm varies naturally between technical observation and lyrical transformation. Minor template cadence in the "She stopped" sequence, though it creates intentional accumulative effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The reversal of subject/object relationship (plant waiting for human transformation) offers fresh perspective on familiar nature-communion themes. Specific details like "conversation compatibility" and plants arranged by dialogue potential show originality. The piece commits to its premise without retreat, though the transformation follows somewhat predictable emotional beats.</comment>
