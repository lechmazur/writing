<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's internal conflict between breaking and healing manifests concretely through the kintsugi ritual, with each pockmark matched to specific trauma. Her final choice to embrace "the version of me I abandoned" carries genuine cost through tears-turned-lacquer. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("weight of kintsugi intentions") and occasional therapy-speak ("quilts memories together") that briefly distances from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the matching of wounds to memories, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the workshop transforms from "raft on oblivion" to "altar." The cost is viscerally felt through the alchemist's tears becoming golden lacquer and her acceptance of brokenness. Slight deduction for minor orientation wobble (the statue's sudden appearance could be better anchored).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The acid sea and deteriorating workshop create persistent pressure that shapes every choice, from the urgency of completion to the final transformation. Vivid sensory detail ("hissed like a chorus of dying serpents," "green fumes curling through grated vents") grounds the fantastic elements. The environment actively constrains action and charges the final altar image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each matched wound deepens the ritual's cost, with the workshop's deterioration ("seam split near the starboard gear shaft") creating a ticking clock. The dominant stake—conjuring meaning from ruin—tightens as personal cost increases. The resolution through transformed perception ("no longer felt like a raft on oblivion—it felt like an altar") carries clear emotional price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The kintsugi metaphor organically shapes both action and meaning, with the "gild fractures" concept driving the concrete matching of wounds to memories. The final transformation from survival space to sacred space offers a resonant answer about finding meaning through acknowledged brokenness. Theme emerges through accumulated images rather than stated morals.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("clattering dark," "quilts memories together") and strong perceptual signature focused on texture and decay. Some register elevation in peak moments ("crucible of collapse, gilded by grief") slightly strains the established voice. Psychic distance modulates effectively from external description to intimate confession.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong image-making. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("crucible of collapse, gilded by grief, held together by intention") and some template phrasing ("She stood," "She took," "She knelt"). The extended metaphorical runs occasionally slow momentum but generally serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy and kintsugi creates an original emotional landscape where healing requires acknowledging rather than hiding damage. The specific matching of stone wounds to soul scars offers a non-obvious approach to trauma and transformation. The risk of lyrical density pays off through coherent accumulation toward the altar image.</comment>
