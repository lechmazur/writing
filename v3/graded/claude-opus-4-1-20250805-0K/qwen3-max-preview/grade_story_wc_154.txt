<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" drives concrete action through the decryption scene, with her shrewdly innocent translator persona enabling empathetic connection. The child's cast discovery triggers embodied response ("knelt, the coral fragment pressing into her thigh"), and her final choice to witness rather than fix shows earned understanding with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered imagery (coral/cast/scribbles) building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira transforms from grief to kinship. The orientation anchors (anesthetic/atrium/twilight) establish liminal space by ~60 words, and closure lands with felt cost ("lotus-hearted ache... kinship"). Minor deduction for slight abstraction in final paragraphs ("symbiosis" feels elevated beyond POV).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium creates atmospheric pressure with "glass ceiling dripped with condensation, refracting the bruised twilight," and the coral fragment constrains choice as tactile anchor throughout. Setting actively participates when "the atrium exhaled" after the decryption. Slight dock for generic "pillars into sentinels" metaphor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on witnessing versus erasure, with meaningful deepening when decrypted phrases reveal "they lied but the sea didn't." The coral's warmth increasing during decryption shows accumulative pressure, and Mira's shift from translator to witness carries emotional cost. However, external pressure remains purely internal/memorial without active opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing versus fixing emerges organically through the decryption act and coral/cast pairing, culminating in "learned to carry it with grace." The transformation of "grief" to "kinship" reweights all prior imagery without stating a moral. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "symbiosis" terminology.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with translator's precision ("parsing ceasefire whispers and coded grief") and lyric compression ("lotus-hearted ache"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance, though some elevated diction ("calcified into something that could still hold light") occasionally drifts from established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variation and purposeful repetition ("Let it breathe. Let it be witnessed.") creates momentum. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("bruised twilight into liquid gold") and one register drift ("symbiosis" feels academic for this POV).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of war trauma and coral reef imagery, with the translator-as-witness angle avoiding typical PTSD narratives. The decryption method transforms expected healing narrative into acceptance of "carrying with grace." Specific details like "fractured radius" and "refugee smoke" ground the concept.</comment>
