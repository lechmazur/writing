I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through rhythmic repetition and sensory accumulation rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bell tuner's motivation crystallizes through embodied action—her methodical walking becomes both character trait and narrative engine. Her "infinite patience" manifests concretely in metronomic steps and deliberate non-interaction with the emerging townsfolk. The final choice to leave the tuning fork creates meaningful renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the town's revival via accumulated rhythm, with clear cost in the bell tuner's departure and the "wild hush" that remains. The accumulative structure coheres—each footstep builds toward the fountain scene where she deposits the fork. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting functions as active participant—cobblestones become instrument, archway frames transformation, fountain serves as fulcrum. The sensory hierarchy (vibration over sound) reflects the bell tuner's specialized perception. The environment constrains her method absolutely: "via the rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through deepening resonance: shutter creaks→candlelight flickers→children peek→rain falls. The dominant stake (restoring Virelle through rhythm) tightens as each footstep accumulates effect. Cost manifests in her silent departure—she gives her instrument and method to the town.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concept of "shared balance between what was lost and what might yet echo." The tuning fork's transformation from personal tool to communal anchor offers non-literal resolution. The ending reweights "wild hush" from absence to "presence holding its breath."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—the bell tuner experiences the world through vibration and rhythm rather than conventional senses. Voice maintains lyric consistency with purposeful repetition ("not... but" constructions) that mirrors the methodical walking. No head-hopping; clean focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and information density, but some figurative density in peak beats ("roots seeking water," "dust motes in slanting sun") without full payoff. Minor template cadence in the "She..." openings mid-story. The prose achieves propulsion through accumulation rather than variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of tuning a town into existence through footsteps offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of musical, architectural, and temporal elements feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the non-causal structure heightens rather than obscures meaning (+0.3 within band).</comment>
