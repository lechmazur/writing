<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arlen's curiosity drives genuine discovery through the hopscotch cipher, with his motivation rooted in the world's "blank spaces whisper[ing] to him like half-remembered lullabies." His transformation from apprentice to "maestro" conducting luminance shows earned growth with visible stakes. Minor deduction for some tell-heavy passages about his traits rather than fully embodied demonstration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural lens with the hopscotch cipher discovery creating a decisive change that transforms the ship's capabilities and Arlen's role. The closure lands with Arlen "whisper[ing] back" to the world's blank spaces, showing earned mastery with clear cost (three nights of obsessive work). Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The airship setting with its "stranded luminance" and "brass fittings [that] groaned like old bones" directly enables the discovery—the luminance becomes manipulable through the hopscotch pattern. Sensory details like "starling murmurations...like living inkblots" create atmosphere while serving the plot's luminance-bird connection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to ship-wide transformation as Arlen proves his theory, with the crew chalking larger grids and ships altering course to witness. The cost is visible in his "trembling hands" and three sleepless nights. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the external conflict could intensify further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of play (hopscotch) into discovery and communication—Arlen finding "a language" in patterns others overlook. The ending reweights earlier isolation as "sociable isolation" where connection comes through shared discovery. The blank phrasebook page awaiting his own contribution resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with evocative phrases like "stranded luminance—light caught mid-flight, never quite landing" and controlled rhythm that modulates with discovery beats. POV remains stable in close third. Minor deduction for occasional overwriting ("luminous ballet") that slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure, but some figurative density in non-peak moments ("murmurations...like living inkblots...like miniature dunes") and occasional redundancy ("diligently curious" stated rather than shown). Information density is high and momentum sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The hopscotch-as-navigation-cipher concept offers genuine freshness, transforming children's play into arcane knowledge. The synthesis of birds, light, and chalk patterns feels organic rather than forced. Slightly derivative steampunk airship setting prevents higher scoring.</comment>
