<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The witness's dissolution of self and memory creates genuine internal contradiction between seeking clarity and surrendering identity, with the final transformation earned through accumulated cost. Her journey from observer to lens shows credible endurance that forecloses paths, though some interiority veers toward abstraction ("consciousness expanding like a lung made of spacetime").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught spiral arbitration paying off in the witness becoming "the hush after"—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear conceptual cost. The universe's hiccups bracket and punctuate the transformation effectively. Orientation anchors (temple library, witness role) establish early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library's impossible architecture (domeless sky, spiraling shelves, resonant frequencies) constrains choices and enables the spiral arbitration, with books aging millennia per page-turn creating temporal pressure. The dictionary and regret-bound volume function as micro-settings that charge the final dissolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation through deepening layers of surrender—from reading her future handwriting to letting the library read her to ceasing distinction between seeker/sought—with each phase foreclosing return. The cost manifests as dissolution of language and self, though the abstract register slightly dulls visceral impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the spiral arbitration's resolution of contradictions and the witness's transformation from observer to "the hush after," offering a non-literal answer about meaning existing in silence beneath words. The dissolution of the dictionary's definitions into light perfectly embodies the unraveling of linguistic illusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("wanderingly exact—never lost, never rushed"). The perceptual signature remains consistent through increasingly abstract territory, though peak moments like "consciousness expanding like a lung made of spacetime" risk register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the cosmic scope descriptions. Some abstract constructions strain clarity ("the still point around which all meaning orbits") and occasional template cadence in the "She'd seen/She'd done/She called it" sequence, but propulsion remains strong through varied syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of spiral arbitration as a method "older than language" where contradictions coil inward rather than clash offers fresh synthesis. The witness as "end of history" figure who becomes the silence after reality's dissolution transforms familiar transcendence narratives through specific mechanics.</comment>
