<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The violinist's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—playing "resonantly soft" music to awaken dormant life. Internal conflict manifests in physical detail: "bow trembling," "fingers blistered," yet she persists. The transformation from guardian to gardener in the statues represents earned change through protagonist agency, with visible cost in her physical exhaustion and the spent locust shell.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught transformation: music as tactile force that "uproots" mechanical obedience "note by note." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the orchard's reawakening with visible cost (violinist's blistered fingers, dust of the locust shell). The before/after is legible: from "metallic tang" and "metronomic precision" to "bees returned, buzzing drunkenly."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint and enabler—the sky-bridge positions her above the guarded orchard, statues serve as both obstacle and eventual transformed allies. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "apples glowed with cold luminescence," "moss cracking along its collarbone." The locust shell amplifies "not volume but texture," making music a tactile force that constrains how she can act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake clearly signaled: breaking the "silence strangling this place." Escalation follows textural deepening—from single trembling note to statues freezing, then weeping dew, finally transforming into gardeners. Cost is visible in the violinist's physical deterioration ("bow arm ached, her fingers blistered") and the consumption of her grandmother's gift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the locust metaphor: "Beauty hides in husks" becomes literal as mechanical guardians molt into organic gardeners. The final line "The tarnished wonder of the world wasn't broken. It was molting" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through physical transformation—statues don't surrender but become curious, then nurturing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and selective perception ("where the clouds frayed into mist"). Some elevated diction risks register drift ("metronomic precision," "resonantly soft timbre") but serves the mythic tone. Voice modulates effectively with pressure—shorter, more visceral sentences during peak performance ("She didn't stop").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some ornamental phrases approach overwriting ("wind-chimes woven from moonlight"). Template cadence appears in middle sections ("She played...She shifted...She walked"). Information density is high when focused on transformation scenes, but some descriptive passages could compress further without losing effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of music as physical force that can "uproot" obedience through resonance rather than volume offers fresh angle on familiar awakening narrative. Specific detail of "resonantly soft" playing that seeps "into cracks in their programmed vigilance" transforms expected confrontation. The locust shell as amplifier of texture rather than volume shows originality in execution.</comment>
