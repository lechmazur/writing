<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's "quietly deliberate" trait drives consistent choices throughout, from recording observations to stepping through the threshold. Her motivation to find where shadows go is concrete and persistent, not metaphorical. The final choice to maintain equilibrium with shadows shows earned character development with visible cost (becoming "keeper of thresholds").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elira becomes the threshold keeper, with clear cost (transformation of self). The accumulative/textural lens holds as nightly rituals build toward understanding. Who/where/when anchored early ("floating isle of Vaelis," "observatory," post-spoon world). The seventeen-night progression creates coherent escalation toward the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating observatory setting constrains choices (must use the orrery, must work at night). Sensory details like "brass, cold as lunar frost" and vibrations "up her spine like a struck tuning fork" are specific and purposeful. The spoon-bent reality creates consistent world rules that shape all action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes clearly established: finding where shadows literally go at noon. Escalation through seventeen nights of ritual builds pressure. The cost is visible when Elira transforms into "keeper of thresholds," forever changed. One meaningful deepening as she discovers shadows are "sealed" not destroyed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the literal quest becoming metaphorical understanding of balance and partnership. The final image of noon casting "a shadow—not on the ground, but on time itself" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral. The loop/recursion motif accumulates meaning throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with consistent register ("quietly deliberate," measured observations). Controlled psychic distance maintains scholarly tone even during threshold crossing. Prose rhythm modulates with discovery moments. No head-hopping, stable POV throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some repetitive phrasing ("quietly deliberate" appears 3 times, "closing loops" repeated). Information density generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs. Clear propulsion through the seventeen-night sequence. Minor template cadence in middle section listing what she learned reduces momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of reality-bending spoons with shadow mechanics creates non-obvious premise. The concept of shadows as "sealed awakenings" with consciousness transforms expected physics. Specific world-building details avoid generic fantasy. Risk-taking with the abstract concept pays off through concrete dramatization.</comment>
