<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The knight's transformation from withdrawn mechanical duty to organic surrender is earned through concrete physical unsnapping and pattern-work, with internal contradictions (allegiance to threshold vs forgotten oaths) acting simultaneously. The cost of his transformation is visible in the dissolution of his armored identity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "shape of possibility" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the knight transforms from withdrawn/armored to unfolded/permeable, with visible cost in surrendering mechanical control. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the marionette sequences, building to the threads-as-conduits payoff. Orientation anchors (knight, greenhouse, night) establish by ~100 words. Minor deduction for slightly abstract handling of "possibility" as concept rather than fully dramatized stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse functions as active setting—mercury roots, phosphor-bark, and glass boundaries all respond to and enable the knight's transformation. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through his movements. The setting literally dissolves and reforms in response to action, constraining and enabling choices. Deduction for some ornamental mystical details early that don't return to constrain later choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (capturing possibility through surrender of control) escalates through physical unsnapping, pattern-work, and final harmonization with cosmic threads. Cost is visible in the dissolution of armor/identity. The reversal from control to surrender meaningfully tightens options. Some deduction for the stake remaining somewhat abstract rather than viscerally embodied in specific losses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of liberation through surrender emerges organically from the knight's physical transformation and the marionette metaphor's evolution from puppeteer control to conduit harmony. The ending reweights mechanical duty into organic flow without stating a moral. Strong subtext in the abandoned theater program as cipher for forgotten agency. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("shape of possibility") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric register appropriate to the mystical setting, consistent POV distance, and purposeful rhythm variations that mirror the knight's transformation. Strong perceptual signature in how mystical elements are noticed. Deduction for occasional register elevation ("liturgy of limbs," "syntax of becoming") that slightly exceeds the established voice without clear pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm control, particularly in the transformation sequences. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for scattered template phrases ("not to X, but to Y" appears 5+ times), some abstract/elevated diction in peak beats ("liminal space," "syntax of becoming"), and minor paraphrase loops around the unsnapping concept.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knight/marionette/alchemical elements creates an original angle on transformation narrative. The specific detail of "unsnapping" joints and becoming a conduit rather than controller offers genuine innovation. Risk-taking in the lyric/mystical register heightens stakes effectively. The integration of puppet theater with cosmic possibility feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
