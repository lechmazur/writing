<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to "thaw mistrust with transparency" drives meaningful choices through lens placement and vulnerable exposure, with the child's touch crystallizing trust at closure. Internal states are embodied through physical details (lens cool against ribs, arms loose) rather than labels, though some keepers lack distinct traits beyond their isolation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through collective harmony emerging from silent vulnerability, with the lens cracking upon "completion" marking transformation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases from individual isolation to communal humming, with mistrust thawing through exposure rather than speech.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt's quartz veins and rain-pooled glyphs constrain movement and enable the lens's light-focusing function that catalyzes change. Sensory hierarchy privileges sound/silence ("metronomic rhythm," "resonant hush") over sight, matching the post-verbal world where "words became unnecessary."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from Elira's solitary placement of tickets, to keepers emerging, to tactile connection (Tannis tracing, Vorr grounding), culminating in collective humming. The lens's warmth absorbing "withheld truths" provides tangible cost, though the transformation feels slightly too smooth given seven seasons of isolation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "ambiguously clear clarity"—transparency achieved through cryptic doodles rather than words. The lens breaking from "completion, not strain" and the tickets fading "no longer needed" create a resonant answer about vulnerability transcending articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with purposeful compression ("not to read, but to listen to the air itself") and selective perception focused on silence's weight. The perceptual signature privileges spaces between things—breaths, glances, light bleeding sideways—though occasionally edges toward precious ("liquid stars").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the lens caught the beam and threw it downward—not as an image, but as a trembling circle of silver"). Some elevated diction strains POV credibility ("metronomic rhythm," "resonant hush"), and repetitive "No one spoke/No one needed to" structure briefly stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The post-verbal world where memory travels "like scent" and archives exist for listening rather than reading offers fresh speculative grounding. The specific synthesis of projection technology with emotional transparency through "cryptic doodles" that must be "felt" rather than decoded shows genuine invention.</comment>
