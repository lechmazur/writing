<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's patient observation evolving into active learning demonstrates clear motivation rooted in preservation. The internal shift from "collecting seeds" to "collecting hands" lands with earned weight. Minor deduction for some abstraction in early philosophical framing ("ancient methods as living rhythms") that lacks immediate embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern teaching through knot-learning building to the resonant "collecting hands" reconfiguration. Closure lands with visible cost—the commitment to return "when fog rolls again." The fulgurite-as-offering initiates trust; each knot deepens connection until the final promise crystallizes the relationship's future.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The golden dock, snow, fog, and rope become active constraints shaping interaction—fog creates intimacy, cold tests endurance, rope carries history. Sensory hierarchy reflects the collector's focus: tactile rope details over visual fog. The fulgurite's "sky's broken tooth" metaphor and final sun-shaft piercing fog charge the ending with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on preserving vanishing knowledge through embodied learning versus documentation. The tension between "photograph/frame/forget" and "carry/weave" creates meaningful pressure. The protagonist's patient sitting, mimicry, and failure before success shows agency foreclosing the easier path of mere observation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the knots themselves—each pattern encoding survival wisdom and loss. The fulgurite symbolizes "chaos leaves behind beauty, if one knows how to hold it," paid off in learning to hold knowledge through hands. The shift from seed-collecting to hand-collecting reweights the preservation mission without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in the protagonist's philosophical framing and patient observation. Havel's voice effectively contrasts through clipped, practical speech ("Most want to photograph. Frame. Forget."). Some filter-verb clustering in middle sections ("knowing," "letting," "feeling") slightly dulls immediacy during the learning sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("fingers gnarled like driftwood," "pebbles rolling in a receding wave"). Template cadence appears in the knot-learning section with repeated "The [name]" structures. Some paraphrase loops around patience and waiting concepts. Information density high in dialogue exchanges but occasionally diluted in transitional passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The knot-patterns-as-stories concept transforms a craft preservation narrative into something more resonant. Specific knot names and meanings ("widow's braid," "moon's sigh," "whale's turn") create authentic texture. The philosophical seed collector learning rope-work offers a non-obvious angle, though the wise-elder-teaches-patient-youth frame is familiar.</comment>
