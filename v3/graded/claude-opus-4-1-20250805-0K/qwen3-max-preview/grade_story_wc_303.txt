<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's conflicted stance between empire and dream drives authentic choices, particularly her decision to use the violin despite knowing it will melt. The Chancellor's transformation from authority to reverence feels earned through the plant-mediated revelation. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "perforated destinies" that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and plant communications build toward the Resonant Reconfiguration where the Chancellor kneels in "dawning reverence." The cost is visible: the empire's collapse implied through his transformation and the violin's destruction. The "perforated destiny" concept effectively structures the accumulation of silenced histories into the final garden image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The velvet observatory functions as more than setting—its textures (velvet, moss, mycelium) become conduits for Elira's telepathy and the story's resolution. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elira's plant-attuned perception. The transformation from cosmic observation chamber to "terrestrial truth" garden directly constrains and enables the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from authenticating an artifact to choosing between empire and ecological truth, with the Chancellor's arrival as pressure point. The violin's melting into seeds that root in the Chancellor deepens rather than reverses, forcing transformation rather than confrontation. Cost is legible in the empire's dissolution and Elira's acceptance of her telepathic burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ice violin as "accumulated witness" and the plants as carriers of suppressed truth, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final garden replacing the empire offers a non-literal answer about how truth propagates through organic networks rather than imperial structures. "Mulberry ache" resonates in the "sweet, bruising sorrow of endings that make room for roots."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through botanical awareness ("constellation...like bruised mulberries," "mycelium...thrumming with dread"). Voice maintains lyric density under pressure without becoming opaque. Minor filter-verb clustering ("she watched," "she felt") in middle sections slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and information density, with lines like "perforations in the empire's story now a conduit for truth" doing multiple jobs. Some metaphor density in peak beats ("gilded cage," "stolen relics," "silenced histories") and occasional abstract phrasing ("propagated," "resonance") that could be more concrete. No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of plant telepathy with imperial collapse through an ice violin that melts into seeds feels non-obvious and earned. The "perforated destiny" concept transforms from abstraction to concrete image. Risk-taking in the lyric density and botanical resolution heightens rather than obscures the stakes.</comment>
