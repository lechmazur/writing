<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Prophet's motivation "to turn obstacles into instruments" drives consistent choices throughout, from transforming the blackening sea into an obsidian drum to passing the mallet to Kael. Internal consistency holds as he maintains euphoria over fury when overwhelmed. The transformation of Kael from passive scribe to active participant earns its arc through specific action (catching and using the mallet).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with escalating density—from cloud interpretation to wave-xylophone to fruit-seed percussion—culminating in Kael's transformation that alters the generating algorithm. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as "the tide turned—not away, but inward," showing irrevocable change with felt cost (exhaustion). Orientation anchors firmly by ~100 words with Prophet, orchard, blue hour established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The orchard-as-instrument constrains every choice, from mallet strikes on roots to fruit bursting as percussion. Sensory hierarchy reflects the Prophet's sonic worldview: "cumulus swell a fermata, each cirrus streak a staccato cue." The blackening sea's transformation into "obsidian glass" then "translucent again, humming with afterglow" tracks environmental evolution through action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through sonic accumulation: cloud-reading → wave-playing → sea darkening → fruit-seed percussion → Kael's golden helix altering reality. The Prophet's agency drives each escalation, with visible cost in his exhaustion. The transformation isn't reversed but internalized as "the tide turned inward," showing permanent change.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central action of transforming obstacles (darkening sea, fractal clouds) into instruments without stating the moral. The golden helix spiraling from Kael's strike offers a non-literal answer about apprenticeship and transformation. Subtext operates through the Prophet's euphoria versus Kael's overwhelm, revealing different relationships to power.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature pervades: the Prophet perceives through musical metaphor ("each cumulus swell a fermata"), while prose rhythm accelerates during the playing sequence through shorter, percussive sentences. Voice maintains consistency even under pressure, with specialized diction ("subsonic pulses," "resonant imprinting") fitting the world's logic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The black sea softened, lightened, became translucent again, humming with afterglow" tracks transformation while maintaining sonic focus. Some figurative density in peak beats ("fractal generating spirals... recursive and urgent") but serves the pattern. Minor template cadence in "The Prophet smiled... Kael stared... The orchard sighed" sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of music-as-magic through specific mechanics: "dubs" as emotional frequency recordings on waxed kelp, waves forming liquid xylophones with different overtones per crest. The transformation of natural phenomena into playable instruments feels inevitable given the established world-logic. Risk-taking in the density of invented concepts pays off through coherent execution.</comment>
