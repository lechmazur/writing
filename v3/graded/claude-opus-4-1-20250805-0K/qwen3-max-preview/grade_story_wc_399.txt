<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to preserve wisdom drives consistent action through ritual and peripheral awareness, with internal contradiction between discipline (masked side) and acceptance (exposed side) embodied throughout. The final choice to walk on after consecration shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("whisperfield calm") that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through conjured clearings that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the pavilion achieves sanctity through surrender. The orientation anchors (pavilion, after prophet, desert setting) establish by ~100 words. Cost is visible in "muscles humming with spent focus" and the permanence of preservation. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of some causal links between clearings and preservation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The pavilion's architecture ("lattice of petrified vines and wind-sculpted arches") and the buried kinetic parapet constrain the ritual's method and enable the consecration. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (warm stone, dry sage, ozone). The setting actively shapes the protagonist's choices through its "murmuring" response and the parapet's mechanical alignment, charging the final image of hovering clearings.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving wisdom's echo) deepens through accumulation as each clearing forms and stabilizes, with the parapet's response creating reciprocal pressure. The protagonist's agency drives the ritual through peripheral awareness rather than force. Cost is legible in physical exhaustion and the irreversible nature of consecration, though the conflict lacks a sharp tightening moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of preservation through absence and surrender rather than force, embodied in the mask's asymmetry and the conjured clearings that hold "not sound, but essence." The final image of invisible clearings carrying whispers offers a non-literal answer about wisdom's transmission. Minor deduction for occasionally abstract phrasing ("strangely honest") that verges on theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through selective mystical awareness ("felt the parapet stir below, a pulse answering her presence"). The prose maintains controlled rhythm that mirrors the ritual's measured pace. No dialogue to evaluate. Clean focalization throughout with purposeful psychic distance shifts during the ritual's peak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptions that advance both setting and emotional state. Some repetitive phrasing around "clearing" and "echo" creates minor loops. Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions across 3-4 consecutive sentences. The prose maintains momentum despite these artifacts, with strong syntactic variety overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of consecration through peripheral awareness and psychic clearings offers a fresh angle on preservation rituals. The half-mask as embodied duality and the kinetic parapet as responsive architecture show specific invention. However, the mystical desert setting and prophet figure draw on familiar spiritual journey templates without sufficient transformation.</comment>
