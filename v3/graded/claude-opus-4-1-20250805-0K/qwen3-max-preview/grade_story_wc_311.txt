<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reaper's transformation from heartbreak to "heart-carrier" is earned through concrete action (naming the monsters, crystallizing grief) with visible cost. Internal contradiction between duty and regret drives the central choice. Deduction for some abstract phrasing around grief and memory that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught crystallization method paying off at closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration (from heartbroken to heart-carrier) lands with felt cost through the naming ritual. Orientation anchored early (reaper, observatory, dusk). Minor deduction for the "echo of sacrifice" remaining somewhat abstract despite the Her/storm backstory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choice through its broken prism and specific architecture that enables the crystallization ritual. Sensory detail filters through POV's grief-state effectively. The atlas page functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Deduction for some generic atmospheric phrases ("violet sky," "amber light") that don't fully earn their space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming grief into bearable form) escalates through the naming sequence with each monster receiving witness-status. The cost is legible in his centuries of carrying this weight and the choice to become "heart-carrier." Missing stronger mid-story tightening; the ritual proceeds without significant complication or reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of naming fears to reduce their power emerges organically through the concrete act of transforming sea monsters into witnesses. The final image of the reaper as "heart-carrier" offers a non-literal answer about grief's transformation. Slight deduction for the somewhat explicit "to give names to nameless fears" that edges toward stating the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful repetition ("echoes forgotten phrases") that serves the accumulative design. Clean focalization throughout with appropriate psychic distance shifts. Deduction for occasional register elevation ("cathedral of solitude," "frequency of forgotten fears") that strains against the intimate grief-voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is moderate with most lines advancing atmosphere or emotion. Deductions for repetitive "echo" constructions, some abstract grief-language that could be more concrete, and occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages ("broken teeth biting into twilight").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of death-figure-as-healer with the specific mechanism of naming monsters to transform fear. The crystallization-through-light method and atlas-as-memorial are non-obvious choices. The ending transformation to "heart-carrier" reweights the reaper archetype meaningfully.</comment>
