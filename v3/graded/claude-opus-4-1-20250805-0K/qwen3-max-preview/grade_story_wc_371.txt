<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal journey from grief-carrying routine to quiet rebellion is well-embodied through concrete actions (kneeling, bread-breaking, seed-planting) rather than declared states. The "uncloaking" moment physically manifests her internal shift, and her choice to garden without permits shows agency with visible risk. Minor deduction for some abstraction in lines like "patience is the grammar of absolution" that edge toward diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through the Resonant Reconfiguration of uncloaking and guerrilla gardening, with cost visible in the "armor she didn't know she carried." The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and pays off with the water stirring from hidden springs. Slight deduction for delayed orientation anchors (who/where clarifies gradually) though this serves the meditative discovery mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard functions as more than backdrop—vines swallowing statues and moss muffling footsteps create atmosphere while the tea house and fountain provide spaces that constrain and enable choices. The hidden spring stirring at closure directly charges the final transformation. Setting actively participates in meaning-making through decay becoming fertile ground.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on finding "tenuous absolution" through small acts of defiance, with escalation reading through accumulation: bread offering → uncloaking → seed planting. The cost manifests in "shedding armor" and accepting uncertainty ("doesn't know if they'll grow"). One meaningful deepening occurs when she shifts from passive noticing to active rebellion, though pressure could tighten more decisively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through concrete particulars—the vanished bakery, untouched bread, seeds in cracks—without stating its moral. The final realization that "the sacred isn't in grand cathedrals" but in "quiet courage to uncloak when no one is watching" offers a resonant answer through image and action. The bread transforms from loss-marker to offering to lingering presence, accumulating meaning without forcing symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm that modulates from meditative ("heuristically gentle") to more urgent during the uncloaking. The perceptual signature—noticing "creeping normality," feeling "ghosts of laughter"—creates a specific consciousness. Prose maintains consistency without head-hopping, though occasional abstractions ("grammar of absolution") slightly dilute the embodied texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful variation in sentence length and structure, creating natural rhythm. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme simultaneously. Some abstract phrases ("grammar of absolution," "quiet rebellions") edge toward purple prose but don't overwhelm. The closing image effectively recharges earlier motifs without overexplaining.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "creeping normality noticer" offers a fresh angle on grief and resistance, transforming the familiar lost-place narrative through specific details like "guerrilla gardening" as quiet rebellion. The synthesis of observation and action, passivity and agency creates non-obvious complexity. The piece commits fully to its meditative mode without retreating to conventional resolution.</comment>
