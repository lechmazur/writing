<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's transformation from neutron star researcher to dust phenomenologist is well-motivated through concrete micro-choices (stopping wearing gloves, sleeping beside the slide). Her internal journey from viewing cataclysms as "punctuation, not plot" to finding cosmic patterns in dust shows genuine character evolution with visible cost (abandoning her prestigious field).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elira's final statement "I found them here, in the dust" crystallizes her transformed understanding with professional cost visible. The piece teaches its pattern early (dust as lens for reality) and pays it off through the logarithmic spiral discovery that mirrors her neutron star models.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as more than setting—its broken panes and evolving decay constrain Elira's experiments while charging the final image of transformation. Specific sensory details (wet rot and ozone smell, dust forming hexagons near humidifier) create lived-in texture that reflects POV priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: dust patterns self-organizing into cosmic symmetry, culminating in the logarithmic spiral that forces Elira's weeping recognition of universal patience. The dominant stake—finding meaning in gradual change versus dramatic cataclysm—tightens through each observation until she must choose between careers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the dust-as-temporal-lens metaphor without explicit moralizing. The final image of finding neutron stars "here, in the dust" offers a resonant answer to the central question about scale and significance, reweighting all prior material about decay as refinement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with scientific precision filtering everyday observations ("tracking how morning dew gathered differently on dust-coated leaves"). Voice maintains consistent register through emotional peaks, though some passages edge toward elevated diction ("kindled humility") that slightly strains the POV's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, but occasional overwriting in figurative language ("Poetry, after all, was just physics with fewer equations and more awe") and some filter-verb clustering in observation passages. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, particularly in the greenhouse description sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of astrophysics and ecological phenomenology through butterfly dust offers genuine freshness—not surface novelty but earned transformation of scientific observation. The risk of abandoning dramatic narrative for patient accumulation pays off, though some scientific metaphors lean toward expected comparisons.</comment>
