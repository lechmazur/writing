I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through sensory layering and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's face blindness becomes a lens for perception rather than deficit, with her tactile reading of the coin driving the central action. Her internal realization about blindness-as-lens arrives through embodied discovery, not epiphany. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract formulation of "essence in texture" rather than more embodied language.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the protagonist sitting beneath her painted sky as demolition begins—cost is visible in the imminent destruction. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward this crystallized moment. Slight dock for the cost being more implied than viscerally felt in the final beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The hollowed tree trunk library constrains action throughout—its impending demolition creates urgency, its curved walls shape the painting, its atmosphere of "old paper and damp wood" grounds the ending. Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's tactile primacy. The coin's micro-geography functions as setting that enables the central act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from preserving knowledge to transmuting it through art, with the revelation about her blindness-as-lens deepening the pressure. The demolition countdown provides external urgency while internal stakes shift from deficit to gift. Cost appears in the acceptance of destruction—her art "was never for display."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between seeing faces/surfaces and feeling truth/contours, culminating in "they saw faces and called them whole; she felt contours and called them truth." The transformation of limitation into method resonates without moralizing. The final image of sitting beneath painted heavens as destruction approaches perfectly embodies the theme of ephemeral creation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout—the protagonist experiences the world through pressure, grain, and texture rather than sight. Voice modulates from meditative precision to urgency ("painted faster now") while maintaining coherence. Slight deduction for occasional register elevation ("fractally precise gradations") that doesn't fully align with the tactile POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong syntactic variety and information density, with lines like "each groove translated to a brushstroke" doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in places ("ghost-light of dead astronomers") that borders on overwrought but serves the heightened tone. Minor repetition of "fractally precise" without full payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The central conceit of a face-blind portrait artist who reads texture rather than features offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of disability-as-ability with art-as-translation feels earned through specific detail. The ending's acceptance of destruction without witnesses shows conviction.</comment>
