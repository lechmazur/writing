<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The illustrator's motivation to find where echoes are born drives concrete actions throughout, with the pendant's heat and time-borrowing creating embodied stakes. The character makes micro-choices under pressure (sculpting time to cushion the chime, choosing to draw in the chamber despite risk), though internal contradiction could be more visceral during peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the illustrator's work transforms potential echoes into real birdsong, with cost paid through the pendant's searing heat and borrowed time from the giant's dreams. The orientation anchors solidly (rooftop canals, sleeping giant, natural history illustrator), and causality holds as each discovery builds toward the chamber of unborn sound.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system functions as more than backdrop—channels amplify whispers, stone glyphs store sound, and the chamber of unborn echoes constrains the final choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (moss-slicked stone, mercury-pooled echoes, singing marble), with the environment actively shaping tactics as she navigates acoustically-charged architecture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through time-borrowing's increasing cost (fatigue to searing pendant) and the giant's near-awakening, forcing riskier choices. The dominant stake—finding where echoes are born before borrowed time collapses—tightens when she overborrows and must sculpt time to prevent catastrophe, though a second reversal or deeper complication could strengthen the middle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete action of "midwifing memory"—giving form to what hasn't yet been lost. The final image of birdsong awakening the city offers a non-literal answer about preservation and possibility, with the pendant's heat fading to whisper providing resonant closure without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through the illustrator's attention to resonance and temporal texture ("temporal erosion," "embryos in amniotic silence"). Voice modulates effectively under pressure, though some elevated diction ("amniotic silence," "midwife memory") occasionally strains against the established register without quite breaking it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the canals carry both physical navigation and acoustic properties). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("embryos in amniotic silence," "midwife memory") approaches oversaturation but maintains clarity at closure; occasional template cadence ("She moved...She climbed...She pressed") creates minor drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of natural history illustration with temporal mechanics and acoustic architecture creates a non-obvious world where extinct creatures persist as echoes. The concept of "uncaging moments" and drawing creatures into existence transforms familiar creative act into something stranger, with risk-taking in the premise heightening stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
