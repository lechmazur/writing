<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to uncover the withheld truth is clear and consistent, driving her through the parallel universe with embodied sensory details ("fingers tracing the oily floor"). The revelation about her mother's sacrifice creates genuine emotional weight ("wept, not for loss, but for the unbearable lightness of knowing"). Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of her initial quest and limited concrete micro-choices under pressure in the middle section.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elira discovers the truth reweights her entire existence ("some truths don't set you free—they make you responsible"). The cost is felt through her tears and the weight of knowledge. Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore linkage from shard discovery to universe crossing to truth revelation. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of the "withheld truth" concept before its reveal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay effectively contrasts between universes (cold/metallic vs. warm/maintained), with sensory details like "oily floor" and "dust motes drifted through shafts of fractured light." The green shard functions as micro-setting that constrains choices. Deduction for limited spatial choreography within scenes and some generic sci-fi elements that don't fully leverage the specific setting's potential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal discovery to existential revelation about Elira's very existence being an "accident of divergence." The cost manifests in her non-existence in Universe Sigma-7 and the weight of responsibility. One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers her mother's sacrifice. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the conflict until the final revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the concrete discovery that "some truths don't set you free—they make you responsible," avoiding moral platitudes. The green shard's transformation from compass to fulfilled purpose creates resonant imagery. The mother's sacrifice across universes embodies the theme of truth's weight. Exceptional integration of theme with plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic precision ("viscous, like stepping through syrup made of memory") and controlled psychic distance. The perceptual signature focuses on sensory mapping unique to Elira's abilities. Minor deduction for occasional drift into elevated register ("cathedral of silence") that slightly strains the POV's established lexicon during non-peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The green shard flared, then dimmed—not broken, but fulfilled"). Varied sentence structures and rhythmic control. Deduction for occasional overwriting in metaphorical density ("film peeling from reality's surface") and some register drift into abstract philosophical territory that occasionally slows momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh angle on parallel universe travel through sensory mapping rather than technology, with the specific detail of charting "thresholds...sensed through scent, vibration, and the faint electric hum." The mother's cross-universe sacrifice to anchor her daughter's existence offers genuine emotional complexity. The "accidental existence" concept transforms familiar multiverse tropes.</comment>
