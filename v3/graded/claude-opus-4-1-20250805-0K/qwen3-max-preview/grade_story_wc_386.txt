<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ghost whisperer's motivation to salvage emotional echoes rather than material wealth drives clear, consistent choices throughout, with her careful truth-weaving creating genuine internal tension. The child ghost's characterization through dream cameos and the final "You'll be safe" memory effectively embodies preservation instinct under crisis. Minor deduction for some abstraction in describing her methods ("weaves truth carefully") rather than showing the cost of that carefulness in more embodied moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where the melted snow globe transforms into a crystalline window, releasing the child's purpose and rippling into strangers' lives with visible emotional cost. The piece teaches its dream-cameo pattern early and pays it off through specific examples (fisherman, librarian, widow) that reweight the central preservation theme. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the shrine setting and the ghost whisperer's role.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine carved with ice windows creates a liminal space that perfectly mirrors the story's thematic concern with transparent thresholds between living and dead. The melted snow globe's physical transformation—glass softened by pressure, miniature town slumped—embodies the story's central metaphor of preserved love despite destruction. The ice responding to the globe by forming "miniature streets in crystalline relief" demonstrates setting as active participant in the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—salvaging uncorrupted emotional echoes from drowned objects—intensifies through the revelation of the child's final protective act and culminates in the ghost whisperer's choice to create a permanent window rather than exorcise. Cost is visible in the released sigh and the ripple effects on strangers who must confront their own losses. The escalation through dream analysis to shrine ritual to release works under the accumulative lens, though the protagonist's agency could be more contested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The window metaphor evolves from literal glacier carvings to dream appearances to the final "window within a window" that refracts meaning into strangers' lives, avoiding heavy-handed symbolism through concrete particulars. The child's message—that even in drowning she protected something—resonates through specific dream actions (fisherman calling daughter, widow scattering ashes) without moralizing. The theme of preservation through transformation emerges organically from the melted but still-warm snow globe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive lyrical voice with controlled rhythm that modulates between meditative passages ("truth, when mishandled, shatters like ice underfoot") and concrete scene work, maintaining the ghost whisperer's perspective throughout. The prose texture shifts appropriately from the mystical shrine descriptions to the mundane dream cataloguing to the emotional release. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("ancient, blue-veined ice") that slightly exceeds the established voice's natural range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong sentence-level propulsion with varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm, particularly in the dream-cameo listings and the final ripple effects. Information density is high with most lines serving multiple functions (character, atmosphere, theme). Deduction for two instances of mild overwriting ("bleeds violet over the glacier's crown," "ancient, blue-veined ice") and one paraphrase loop ("windows of connection—that's what the ghost whisperer calls them").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diving, ghost whispering, and dream analysis creates a genuinely fresh angle on grief and preservation, with the glacier shrine as unexpected but perfect setting for this liminal work. The specific detail of analyzing "cameo appearances in strangers' dreams" rather than direct séances transforms the familiar ghost story into something memorably particular. Risk-taking in the quiet, ripple-effect ending pays off by trusting accumulative resonance over dramatic confrontation (+0.3 within band).</comment>
