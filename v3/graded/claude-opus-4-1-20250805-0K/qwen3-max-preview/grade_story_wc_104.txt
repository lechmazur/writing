<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's patient methodology and internal resolve create consistent motivation through concrete actions (decoding keys, planting spores, scattering seeds). Her choice to plant the arrow as a marker rather than use it as a weapon reveals character through restraint. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("quiet, inevitable, and utterly transformative") rather than fully embodied states in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with seeds as the dominant through-line, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where scattered seeds promise transformation against the falling wall. The piano key cipher provides solid causality for vault access. Cost is visible in her chains, the weight of seeds "heavier than any iron," and the stakes of tomorrow's wall demolition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting constrains movement (chains, dusty gloom) and provides the specific piano-lock mechanism that shapes the central action. Sensory details like "dust motes that danced like pollen" and "the scent of dry soil and distant smoke" are POV-filtered and purposeful. The decaying arcade atmosphere charges the contrast between past entertainment and future survival.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on breaching the seed vault before the wall falls tomorrow, with clear time pressure. The protagonist's agency drives the decoding sequence and seed scattering despite her chains. The escalation from solving the cipher to filling every available space with seeds shows meaningful deepening, though the raiders' threat remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of planting seeds in hostile conditions—literal seeds becoming hope and resilience. The arrow transformed from weapon to marker, the acorn-key placed in its shaft, and seeds scattered "where they think nothing can" all build thematic resonance without stating morals. The final image of inevitable green reweights all prior actions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("soil remembers every drop of blood") and selective perception focused on seeds, growth, and transformation. Some register elevation in phrases like "staggering grace" and "dignity of a falling monarch" slightly strains the established voice. Clean focalization throughout with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong moments like "Each step cracked the earth. Each breath carried spores" show excellent compression. However, several instances of elevated diction ("the staggering grace of someone who knew," "dignity of a falling monarch") create register drift. Some paraphrase loops appear ("She wasn't just opening a door. She was planting resilience") that reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The seed vault as musical cipher and the arrow repurposed as marker show creative transformation of expected elements. The specific seed varieties (millet, teff, amaranth) and mycorrhizal spores demonstrate authentic knowledge. The fusion of carnival decay with botanical hope creates a memorable juxtaposition, though some metaphors lean toward the expected.</comment>
