<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is clear and rooted in her decades of preservation work, with concrete embodied emotion ("tears carving paths through the salt on her cheeks"). However, internal conflict lacks simultaneity—her transformation from academic to spiritual witness happens without visible struggle or contradictory impulses acting together in scene. The final acceptance of being "retrocognitively trapped" as witness shows earned endurance with cost, but the journey there needed more embodied resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the archivist becoming "the living ledger" and accepting her role as witness, with visible cost in "sleeps little now." The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through debris arrangements, phosphorescent revelations, and the final "We are not gone. We are waiting." However, the midpoint stretches thin with summary ("Scholars arrived with scanners") rather than dramatized pressure, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices through the lagoon's selective responsiveness—it "remained mute" until proper offerings, only glows on massacre anniversaries, requires specific tidal conditions. The floating library's physical swaying ("shelves swaying with every gust") and the lagoon's obsidian surface create vivid atmosphere. Beach debris becomes micro-setting that drives action through arranged messages, meeting the 9+ gate of environment constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on uncovering suppressed truth, with one meaningful deepening when the lagoon reveals submerged faces and the archivist realizes she's "retrocognitively trapped." However, escalation relies heavily on accumulation rather than active pressure—the archivist experiments with arrangements but faces minimal opposition or cost until the revelation. The final acceptance carries weight but the middle lacks tightening choices that would elevate the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between official records and "the body's unspoken archive," with the diary requiring souls rather than machines for decryption. The final line "We are not gone. We are waiting" offers resonant closure without moralizing. However, some passages veer toward abstraction ("truth thrives in tension") rather than staying grounded in particulars, and the piece occasionally tells its theme directly rather than letting it emerge purely from events.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose has distinct texture with evocative phrases ("salt-scarred dunes," "spilled ink under moonlight") and controlled lexicon fitting an archivist's perspective. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction in peak moments ("unbearable, searing reverie of standing between what was and what must be") that doesn't match the established voice. No dialogue to evaluate, but the internal voice maintains consistency except when it reaches for profundity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery ("obsidian lagoon," "corroded copper") but severe template cadence issues: "She had spent...She had tried...She knew then she was..." runs throughout. Abstract philosophical assertions ("Truth, she learned, thrives in tension") replace concrete scene work in multiple beats. The piece tells about scholars arriving and visitors seeking reckoning rather than dramatizing these pivotal moments, creating momentum drag that obscures the closure's impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of a diary requiring "souls retrocognitively trapped in loops of injustice" rather than machines offers genuine freshness, as does the lagoon responding only to arranged debris messages. However, execution relies on familiar civil rights archive tropes and the floating library feels ornamental rather than essential. The synthesis of supernatural history with archival work shows originality but doesn't fully escape genre conventions.</comment>
