I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inferred: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered imagery and recurring motifs (moss, amber, patterns) toward a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist transforms trauma into sanctuary.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction between vulnerability and resilience plays out through concrete actions (offering nectar, burying the confession). The transformation from wound to sanctuary is earned through accumulated gestures. Motivation remains consistent and embodied through specific choices like bringing seeds tomorrow.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly through Earned Stasis - she's "not fixed" but "becoming," with visible cost in the public confession's transformation. The accumulative lens holds as moss patterns, drip marks, and amber echoes build toward the final image of "protected vulnerability." Orientation anchors clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The moss-consumed data center functions as both setting and metaphor, constraining choices (she moves "quietly proactive") and enabling transformation. Sensory hierarchy reflects POV priorities - noting "honeyed hush" over visual decay. The icicle patterns become method and meaning, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming agency after viral exposure) deepens through accumulation rather than reversal. The shift from hiding to "grafting new meaning" shows agency through micro-choices. Cost is visible in placing the confession under moss - transformation requires accepting rather than erasing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the moss/technology fusion metaphor without stating morals. The final image of walking "beside" the past rather than outrunning it offers a non-literal answer to trauma's question. "Protected vulnerability" as beating heart resonates without explaining.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout - she notices textures, patterns, and transformations others wouldn't. Voice modulates from observational to intimate without losing consistency. No dialogue to evaluate, but interior voice maintains specificity under emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good information density, though some figurative density in early paragraphs ("moss-choked threshold," "steel-gray ruin," "emerald moss"). Minor template cadence in "She had... She moved... She knelt" sequence. Strong final line recharges earlier motifs effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data center decay with natural reclamation creates non-obvious metaphor for trauma recovery. The specific detail of icicle drip patterns as healing method shows originality. Avoids therapeutic clichés while exploring vulnerability, though the moss-as-reclamation trope is somewhat familiar.</comment>
