<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—cataloging drowned memories through ritual note-placement—with embodied emotion in her silent weeping and the physical lightening she feels after emptying the inkwell. The bride's letter discovery creates genuine internal conflict between her stoicism and sensitivity. Minor deduction for some abstraction in "archeologist of abandoned dreams" not fully grounded in concrete action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered note-placements building to the bride's letter discovery and Elara's transformation. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with visible cost—the emptied inkwell and Elara feeling "lighter—not hollow, but clarified." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion functions as active setting—its "beams groaning under invisible currents" and "tiles shifting like teeth" create resistance that shapes Elara's ritual. Vivid sensory detail ("silt swirling like ghosts," "barnacle-crowns dangling") filtered through her surveyor's eye. The environment constrains choices (drawbridge sealing, water rising) and charges the final image of lights beneath waves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving memory against entropy) established early and deepens through accumulating note-placements to the bride's letter discovery, which forces Elara's emotional breakthrough. The pavilion's physical resistance ("resisted her—not with hostility, but with entropy") creates coherent pressure. Cost is visible in the draining inkwell and Elara's transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of witnessed absence versus presence emerges organically through concrete actions—each note countering oblivion. The bride's letter reweights all prior note-placements as parallel acts of choosing memory over forgetting. Final image of refilling the inkwell from "river, rain, tears" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("ghosts around her ankles," "barnacle-crowns," "brackish water and memory"). POV distance modulates effectively from external observation to intimate interiority during the weeping scene. Perceptual signature strong—Elara notices structural details befitting a surveyor while investing them with emotional weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("drawbridge rose with groan of rust and resolve"). Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("interlaced absence," "layered silence") and slight overwriting in metaphorical density, though it serves the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archaeological preservation with emotional cartography—placing notes as counter-entropy ritual. The specific detail of copying the bride's letter while returning the original shows originality. Some familiar elements (submerged ruins, lost memories) prevent higher score despite strong execution.</comment>
