<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's ability to taste memories drives concrete choices throughout—pruning with intention, planting the seed, allowing crooked growth. Her internal experience of swallowing memories and rewiring grief feels embodied and specific, though some moments edge toward abstraction ("letting synaptic plasticity rewire her own grief"). The final choice to tend rather than harvest shows earned wisdom with visible cost in her ongoing commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's transformation of the greenhouse from decay to "quiet potential," with visible cost in her nightly commitment to tend. The accumulative lens holds as memories layer and the knowledge fruit grows sideways, creating resonance rather than resolution. Orientation anchors clearly (chef, greenhouse, celestial alignment), and the piece teaches its pattern of memory-as-taste early, though some causality around synaptic plasticity remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as both setting and metaphor—its rust, broken glass, and overgrown vines constrain Elara's movements and choices throughout. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("iron rot and damp earth," "moonlight like stained cathedral windows"). The knowledge fruit's sideways growth along rusted beams demonstrates how setting shapes outcome, earning the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming ruin into potential—escalates through Elara's pruning choices, seed planting, and decision not to harvest. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as memories flood her tongue with each cut. The celestial alignment provides time pressure, though the actual cost of her ongoing commitment could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the central metaphor of "gentle rebellion"—not overthrowing but reweaving. The knowledge fruit growing "crooked but true" and neighbors tasting their own memories in tea creates resonance without stating morals. The final image of stories "waiting to be tasted, shared, and rewoven" offers a non-literal answer to questions about memory, wisdom, and renewal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("She could taste memories—not just flavors, but the echoes"). The prose modulates effectively between action and reflection, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("monument to decay," "gloriously"). No dialogue appears, so those criteria are waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The vines weren't enemies—they were archives"). Some figurative density in peak moments edges toward overwriting ("stars stitched silver threads"), and occasional abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("letting synaptic plasticity rewire"). No major loops or scaffolding, but register occasionally drifts academic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The central conceit of a chef who tastes memories while transforming a ruined greenhouse offers genuine freshness. The knowledge fruit that grows sideways and bears sensations rather than letters transforms expected tropes. While "gentle rebellion" risks abstraction, its execution through specific acts of pruning and tending grounds it in particularity.</comment>
