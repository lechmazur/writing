<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Molt's sardonic persona and subsequent molting into "something softer, fiercer" shows genuine character transformation with embodied details like "breath fogging in the chill" and specific actions (planting seeds, singing). The friendship with Elias provides concrete motivation for her shift from cynicism to revolutionary hope, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("gardener of the impossible").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Molt's transformation crystallizing through layered actions (pinning poem, lighting candle, planting seeds, singing) that build to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she becomes "exactly what the world needed." The cost is visible in grief over Elias's transfer and her shedding of protective cynicism, though the closure could be tighter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rusted library setting actively shapes choices—its "shattered skylight" and "cracks between floorboards" become sites for planting seeds, while moonlight "flooding the ruin with cold, luminous fracture" charges the final transformation. Sensory details like "wax pooled like liquid starlight" and spatial choreography remain clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether beauty can bloom from anarchy—deepens through Molt's progression from reading smuggled poems to actively planting seeds and singing, with Elias's transfer forcing her final stance. The cost appears in her shed cynicism and grief, though escalation could tighten further in the middle section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete actions: "They call us broken. We call us seeds" gains resonance through literal seed-planting and Molt's transformation. The final image of "a vagrant poet planting revolutions in tin cans and floorboards" offers a non-literal answer to whether resistance can bloom in ruin without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent texture with phrases like "sharp as a snapped pencil" and "silver[ing] the library's corroded gutters," modulating effectively from sardonic observation to lyrical transformation. Some passages lean toward elevated diction ("cathedral," "luminous fracture") but remain within the poet-narrator's plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments like "words stuck like burrs in her coat lining" and varied sentence structures, though some passages accumulate figurative language densely ("moonlight stitching the fractures"). Minor template cadence appears in the seed-planting sequence but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a vagrant poet smuggling prison poems and transforming a ruined library into a revolutionary garden offers fresh synthesis of familiar elements. The specific detail of Elias's charcoal poem on a laundry list and Molt's monthly personality molting creates memorable particularity.</comment>
