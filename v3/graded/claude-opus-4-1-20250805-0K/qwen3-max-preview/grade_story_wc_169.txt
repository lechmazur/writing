<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dreamer's motivation is clear and consistent—transforming despair through mathematical precision rather than emotion. Her micro-choices (arranging patterns, launching balloons, recalibrating) reveal layered values with visible cost. The piece earns its Earned Stasis closure through accumulated choices, though interiority occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("serene upheaval humming in her marrow") rather than embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly with pattern-building that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration—the resonance cascade that realigns timelines. Cost is visible in the "0.7 degrees of emotional latitude" and the specific changes in adjacent timelines. The grotto-as-convergence-point anchors orientation early, and the repetitive pattern-launch-observe cycle creates coherent pressure toward the final multiverse exhalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto functions as active setting—a convergence point where timelines brush together, constraining the dreamer's work to this specific location. Sensory details (moonlight fracturing, salt hexagons, bioluminescent anemones) are purposeful and support the mathematical precision theme. The tide's rhythm structures the narrative time. However, some descriptions lean ornamental ("like silk scarves in a slow wind") without adding pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—revitalizing hope's equations across timelines—is signaled early and deepens through incremental successes. The resonance cascade represents meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens, with visible cost in the specific timeline changes. Agency manifests through pattern-creation and calibration choices. The piece lacks sharp reversals but doesn't require them; the accumulation of small victories creates legitimate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mathematical approach to hope—treating it as "a structure, a scaffold of variables." The final image of the multiverse exhaling "lighter than before" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The recurring gauge-as-resonance-meter and trial balloons accumulate meaning. The piece avoids abstraction through specific timeline outcomes (child laughing, ceasefire holding).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance with controlled interiority. Voice shows distinct texture in technical-mystical fusion ("logarithmic spirals," "hydrodynamic script"). However, register occasionally elevates beyond the established voice ("serene upheaval humming in her marrow") and some constructions feel artificially literary. The perceptual signature—seeing equations in natural phenomena—is consistent but sometimes over-explained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong moments ("tide-polished," "trial balloons—tiny, glowing orbs of speculative intent") but suffers from periodic overwriting. Mixed metaphors appear ("hope had different densities" vs. "scaffold of variables"). Template cadence emerges in the pattern-launch-observe sequences ("She began again," "She watched," "She placed"). The piece maintains momentum but occasionally loops conceptually, restating the mathematical-hope connection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—hope as solvable equation across parallel timelines—offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of mathematical precision with emotional stakes avoids both pure abstraction and sentimentality. The specific detail of the altitude gauge measuring "resonance" rather than height shows inventive transformation. Risk-taking in the conceptual approach (+0.3) elevates without obscuring clarity.</comment>
