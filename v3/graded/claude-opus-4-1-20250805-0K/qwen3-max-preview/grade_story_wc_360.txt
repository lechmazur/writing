<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's transposed empathy drives concrete choices throughout—borrowing the widow's grief to create "The Arithmetic of Absence," pressing the halo to the skeptic's forehead. Her method of deliberate ambiguity as pedagogy shows consistent motivation, and the final walk into darkness with "empathy still transposed" demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost (the dimming halo, her lost name).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught density increases building to a Conceptual Repricing where the final glyph means "beginning/ending/bridge" depending on the reader's heart. Orientation anchors clearly (letterpress operator, topaz workshop, vanishing stars), and the cost is legible through the halo's dimming light "siphoned into the pamphlets." The piece teaches its pattern of borrowed identities early and pays it off when she walks away "her name still unsigned."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The topaz workshop with its amber glow and spectral equations creates atmospheric pressure, while the vanishing stars provide temporal urgency. The halo fragment functions as micro-setting that constrains choices—its dimming light limits uses and forces the final departure. Sensory details like "violet ink that smelled of ozone and tasted...like salt and static" are POV-filtered through someone who experiences emotion mathematically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on mapping emotion through borrowed personalities, with escalation through increasingly intense borrowed identities (widow→mad mathematician). The halo's dimming creates resource scarcity that forces the final choice to walk away. The warlord's transformation demonstrates concrete cost, though the protagonist's agency remains primarily observational rather than confrontational.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the mathematics of emotion concept—"grief could be graphed, joy differentiated, love integrated"—without explicit moralizing. The final glyph that means different things "depending on the reader's heart" offers a non-literal answer about empathy's nature. Subtext operates through the pamphlets' effects on recipients and the protagonist's erosion from "empathy without boundaries."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric density with mathematical metaphors ("asymptote of longing," "integral of a sob") that reflect the protagonist's perceptual signature. No dialogue appears, focusing entirely on interiority and description. The prose modulates effectively between technical precision and emotional resonance, with controlled psychic distance throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but some paraphrase loops appear ("deliberate ambiguity" concept restated multiple times). Template cadence emerges in the "She never.../She didn't..." constructions. The mathematical metaphors occasionally strain coherence ("collapsed empathy-space"), though the final image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of transposed empathy as mathematical equation offers fresh synthesis, with the halo fragment as dimensional shard rather than divine artifact. The letterpress operator who borrows personalities to create transformative pamphlets avoids template plots. Risk-taking through the dense lyric mode and abstract concepts mostly succeeds, though some mathematical metaphors feel forced.</comment>
