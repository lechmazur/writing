<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to decode through "borrowed memories" creates a consistent, particular worldview that drives his investigation through sensory echoes rather than conventional methods. His choice to keep the boutonnière and later pin it beside Elara's photograph demonstrates agency with implied cost (protecting their secret). The internal logic of memory-as-residue is embodied through concrete sensations (gravel crunch, pine resin, laughter) rather than abstract reflection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through layered discoveries—body, flower, memory-flash, photograph connection—culminating in Silas's decision to preserve rather than report. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Silas chooses to guard the secret, foreclosing the path of official investigation with the felt cost of "witnessed isolation." The orientation anchors clearly (dock, lighthouse keeper, three nights prior) and causality traces cleanly from flower to memory to revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The opal dock's "pearlescent planks slick with salt" and nautical twilight's "sky bled indigo" create atmospheric specificity that mirrors the story's liminal investigation. The Edelweiss's texture ("brittle as old parchment") and the memory's sensory details (pine resin, iron, mountain pass) ground abstract concepts in physical experience. The lighthouse beam "cutting through mist like a blade through gauze" serves the thematic function of selective revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the flower's meaning—escalates through the memory-flash that reveals the alpine connection and culminates in discovering Elara's photograph, forcing Silas's choice between reporting and protecting. The cost manifests in his acceptance of "witnessed isolation," though this price could be more viscerally felt. The investigation method through "gaps" and sensory echoes provides coherent pressure under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of memory-as-inheritance emerges through concrete particulars: the dried flower's journey from alpine promise to coastal death, the photograph linking two disappeared people, Silas's collection of "echoes." The ending reweights all prior elements—the deliberate gesture, borrowed memories, the lighthouse's guidance of "ghosts"—without stating a moral. "Some truths belong to the sea" crystallizes the story's meditation on private witness versus public record.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains elegant control with distinctive rhythm ("slick with salt and silence," "gap to speak") and a perceptual signature focused on intervals and absences. The prose modulates from atmospheric description to the compressed intensity of the memory-flash, then settles into contemplative resolution. Focalization remains cleanly with Silas throughout, filtering all observations through his particular attention to residue and echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions—"collar turned up against the damp, eyes fixed on the water's edge" establishes character, atmosphere, and focus simultaneously. Some figurative density borders on overwriting ("opal dock," "pearlescent planks") but serves the story's ethereal tone. The closing image of Silas as "keeper of lights and losses" resonates without becoming precious.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of investigating through sensory gaps and borrowed memories offers a fresh angle on the detective story, while the choice to protect rather than expose transforms expectations. The specific combination of alpine flower on a drowned man investigated by a lighthouse keeper who collects echoes feels organic rather than assembled. The ending's refusal of resolution in favor of witnessed isolation takes a meaningful risk.</comment>
