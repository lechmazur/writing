<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The painter's insomnia-driven obsession and "wryly earnest" defense mechanism create genuine internal contradiction, particularly in her whispered apologies to the brooch. Her final choice to trade her art for sleep shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("haggard awe") rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught rain trails leading to discoveries that reweight meaning. The exchange ritual creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (giving up her best work and favorite brush for sleep). The amber-to-seaglass transformation and "changed hands" creates clear before/after. Slight deduction for cost appearing mainly in gesture rather than felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tidal island functions as active setting—rain trails guide discovery, the well defies logic, locals avoid "the place where the tide forgets to leave." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("glowing like a trapped sunset"). The environment directly enables the core action sequence. Missing the full constraint on choice that would elevate to 8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: three found objects, seventeen sleepless nights, then the journal discovery that recontextualizes everything. The protagonist's agency drives the exchange decision with clear cost (her best canvas and favorite brush). Pressure coheres but lacks the sharp tightening or foreclosed option that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concrete: "The moment when grief becomes legacy, when loss calcifies into artifact." The exchange ritual embodies this without stating it. The seaglass transformation and "convergence...changed hands" offers a non-literal answer about how human presence persists through objects.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature with selective attention ("silver veins," "fractal shadows that resembled maps"). Voice maintains wry earnestness throughout pressure. Some register elevation in places ("thresh meaning from experience," "calcifies into artifact") slightly outside the painter's established lexicon but not enough to seriously harm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong images ("librarian of loss," "bruised clouds"). Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("haggard awe"), some filter constructions ("she'd seen it"), and minor template patterns in the middle section listing discoveries.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The amber-preservation-of-emotional-imprints concept offers a fresh angle on memory and loss. The specific synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with art-making and object archaeology feels earned. The exchange ritual and seaglass transformation avoid predictable resolution. Slightly derivative "after the water wars" frame costs some points.</comment>
