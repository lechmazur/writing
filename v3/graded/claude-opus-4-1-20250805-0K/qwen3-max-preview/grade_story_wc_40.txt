<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scholar's motivation is beautifully rooted in "weathered innocence" and her method of listening to architectural echoes reveals character through specific action. Her final spoken response "I don't know...And that is where growth begins" represents genuine change from silent observation to voiced participation. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of her internal experience during the crystal work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with density increasing through layered descriptions of decay, method, and memory until the crystal's question triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration. The scholar's shift from transcriber to participant lands with clear cost—abandoning years of silent method. The who/where/when anchors establish cleanly in the opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library functions as active setting—its "sonically reflective surfaces" and "vaulted ceiling" enable the scholar's method while the dust, silence, and architectural decay constrain her work. The crystal-as-micro-setting drives the central choice. Vivid sensory work: "silence pooled like ink," "dust motes drifting through slanted light."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding growth through decay—builds through accumulation until the crystal's question forces the scholar to abandon her detached observation. Cost is visible in her setting down the stylus and breaking years of silence. The escalation is subtle but appropriate for the textural mode, though a stronger mid-story tightening would elevate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pattern/pause dialectic, culminating in "The pattern was not in the past. It was in the pause." The scholar's method of reading echoes becomes metaphor for cultural memory and growth. The final realization that uncertainty enables growth reweights all prior certainty-seeking without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout—the scholar notices "dust-thick spines," "hollow knock of floorboards," architectural acoustics. Voice modulates perfectly from meditative observation to trembling speech "thin and unused." The prose rhythm mirrors the story's concern with pauses and intervals.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "She transcribed them not in letters, but in glyphs of pressure and pause" advances method, character, and theme simultaneously. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph rhythm. Minor repetition in "weathered innocence" phrase but serves thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The acoustic archaeology method and crystal-as-recording-device offer fresh angles on familiar post-apocalyptic library tropes. The synthesis of sound, architecture, and linguistic decay feels inevitable yet surprising. Risk-taking in the quiet, contemplative approach pays off through specificity.</comment>
