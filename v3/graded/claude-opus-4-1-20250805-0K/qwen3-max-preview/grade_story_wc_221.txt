I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered reflections and sensory details toward a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist's act of witnessing grants the temporal anomaly "peace."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("breath misting," "fingers traced"). The protagonist's choice to remain and witness shows clear motivation rooted in curiosity over fear. Loses points for some abstract phrasing ("confusion had become her compass") and limited internal contradiction in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when her sketching "grants peace" to the temporal anomaly, with visible cost (isolation as "pariah"). The accumulative structure coheres through the sketching ritual. Deducted for slightly abstract cost articulation and some causality softness in how sketching affects the anomaly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail ("stars wheeled overhead in slow, silent arcs," "hollow resonance...like frost"). The temporal distortion constrains perception and action throughout. The observation deck functions as more than backdrop, enabling the discovery of the time filament.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on choosing presence over normalcy, with escalation through discovering the violet filament. Cost is visible in her isolation as "blessed pariah." The deepening from personal ritual to cosmic witness works, though the middle lacks sharp pressure points.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between anchors/currents and the family sketching tradition. The final image of granting the anomaly "peace" through witnessing resonates without stating a moral. Strong integration of "true north" as internal compass rather than external destination.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signature ("temporally stretched," "chronal charge"). Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from character voice ("companionable" silence). Strong control of psychic distance during the sketching sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Deducted for repetitive "stretched" imagery, some abstract constructions ("confusion had become her compass"), and occasional overwriting in metaphors ("frozen fire"). The "echoed silence" repetition feels purposeful but becomes slightly heavy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh angle on time dilation with the sketching-as-witness concept. The "blessed pariah" paradox and family custom feel specific. Some familiar post-apocalyptic elements ("after the shutdown") prevent higher scoring, but the temporal anomaly resolution is non-obvious.</comment>
