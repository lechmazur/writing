<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to "unbind" beauty from the incomplete drives consistent choices through playing specific musical phrases for lost individuals. Her internal consistency holds as she maintains focus on unfinished stories rather than resolution, with the child's petal offering providing earned validation of her approach.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the child's emergence and petal offering crystallizes Lira's work's value with visible cost (the burned world, the losses memorialized). The pattern of musical unbinding accumulates through specific played stories until the greenhouse itself responds, teaching its logic early and paying off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively constrains and enables choices—the acoustic properties guide Lira's playing, the mendicant's bowl's water ripples map vibrations only she can hear, and the shipwrecks echo back melody. The vivid sensory palette ("glass panes fogged with salt and memory," "moss swallowing her boots") creates lived-in specificity that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether Lira's music can unbind trapped beauty from devastation, with escalation through the greenhouse's progressive response (vines stir→glass hums→beam groans→child descends). The cost is legible in the catalog of losses she plays for, though agency remains primarily observational rather than forcing harder choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between destruction and persistent beauty, with the mendicant's bowl transforming from offering vessel to hope repository to final receiver of the scorched petal. The ending's non-literal answer—beauty persists in the incomplete—reweights all prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature emerges through acoustic hypersensitivity ("the silence between notes," "vibration only she can hear") with controlled rhythmic variation matching emotional intensity. The lyric compression and purposeful elision of dialogue serves the meditative tone while maintaining clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The note trembles outward, brushing the panes, nudging the rusted ribs of shipwrecks"). Some repetitive structures appear ("She plays..." sequences) but serve accumulative design; occasional overwriting in metaphorical density ("chronic hush," "glass-lit gloom") creates mild opacity without harming closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with musical healing through "unfinished beauty" offers genuine freshness, avoiding both disaster-porn and redemption clichés. The specific detail of playing stories rather than speaking them, combined with the acoustic perception trait, creates an inevitable-feeling yet non-obvious approach. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens resonance (+0.3).</comment>
