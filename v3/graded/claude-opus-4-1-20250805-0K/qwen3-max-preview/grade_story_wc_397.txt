<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's terminal curiosity and her resentment of "miracles" create genuine internal contradiction, embodied through her methodical listening practice with the parasol tip. The transformation from gripping reality loosely to letting it flow through her shows earned change with visible cost—she abandons her death-seeking for hospice work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught listening methodology culminating in the glacier collapse as sonic epiphany. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara reconceptualizes endings as "thresholds that sing," with cost visible in her near-death on the ice floe and subsequent life redirection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina's sensory palette—groaning floes, Arctic brine, calving bergs—creates atmosphere while constraining choices through treacherous ice and isolation. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting, its resonance revealing the approaching glacier collapse and enabling the pivotal choice to drift toward the sound.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding endings) escalates from passive listening to active pursuit when Elara climbs onto the ice floe toward certain danger. The glacier collapse provides meaningful deepening as she discovers endings are "thresholds" not "events," with near-death as the visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the parasol tip's transformation from wedding canopy remnant to tuning fork for mortality, culminating in the insight that endings "sing." The final shift from seeking endings to recognizing "music between heartbeats" offers resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through Elara's acoustic focus—she experiences the world primarily through sound quality and resonance. Some overwriting in metaphorical passages ("rinsed in Arctic brine") and occasional register elevation, but voice maintains coherence through the transformation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with strong moments ("like someone gripping reality loosely, as if it might slip through her fingers like silt"), but figurative density occasionally overwhelms, particularly in opening and climactic sections. Some template cadence in "She'd..." constructions and metaphor clustering reduces momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of acoustic death-seeking through disaster relief volunteering offers fresh angle on euthanasia tourism. The parasol tip as mortality tuning fork and the glacier's collapse sounding "like a mother humming to a child who would never wake" demonstrate specific originality.</comment>
