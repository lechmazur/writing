<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "find the beginning in every ending" drives concrete choices through tuning methods and fragment placement, with internal contradiction between seeking silence versus signals. The final transformation from passive interpreter to active conductor is earned through accumulated understanding, though some interiority leans toward abstraction ("not metaphorically, but mechanically").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as the protagonist transforms from seeker to conductor, with visible cost in the fragment's dissolution and the towers' awakening. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through layered discoveries, though the middle section's Hollywood fragment exposition slightly interrupts pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The radio tower city functions as both setting and instrument, constraining choices through its rusted gantries and frost-glazed surfaces while ultimately becoming the story's resolution. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("boots crunching on frost-glazed metal," "honey-gold moon"), with the environment actively shaping the protagonist's actions and final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of finding true silence/signal escalates through false echoes to the fragment's arrival to the lunar perigee activation, with cost visible in seven cycles of failure and the fragment's dissolution. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as each discovery reweights understanding, though the middle exposition about the fragment's origin slightly diffuses immediate tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete paradox of manufactured Hollywood fame resonating with cosmic frequencies, culminating in "every ending contains the seed of its own genesis." The final image of the awakened city broadcasting genesis to stars offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior searching without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through technical-mystical fusion ("celestial signal interpreter," "serenely electric") with consistent lyrical elevation that matches the protagonist's role. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance, though occasional abstractions ("fantasy practicality") momentarily break the otherwise immersive voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures create momentum, with purposeful fragments and parallelism in the climactic sequence. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("negative space," "fabric between moments") and some repetitive constructions ("She didn't... She...") accumulate to prevent higher scoring despite the vivid final transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of abandoned technology with cosmic listening offers a fresh angle on connection/isolation themes, with the Hollywood fragment as manufactured artifact containing genuine cosmic resonance being particularly original. The transformation of ruins into instruments through tuning rather than repair shows conceptual ingenuity.</comment>
