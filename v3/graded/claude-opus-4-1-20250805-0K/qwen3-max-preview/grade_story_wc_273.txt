<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tracker's motivation to understand time dilation during crisis is clear and drives every action, with her "serene anger" at the universe creating compelling internal tension. Her final choice to dissolve into the ink demonstrates earned agency through prior investigation. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of her transformation lacking fully embodied cost in the final moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with patterns of disappearing ink building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the tracker dissolves into "negative space between moments." The cost is conceptually clear—she sacrifices physical existence for understanding. Minor deduction because the exact mechanics of her dissolution could be more viscerally grounded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment creates a vivid erosion aesthetic that mirrors the story's themes of impermanence. Sensory details like "fingers brushing cracked clay" and "wind funneled through the canyon of tents" ground the abstract concepts. The setting doesn't fully constrain choices at the climax, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from intellectual curiosity to existential choice as the tracker progresses from observation to self-experimentation with the ink. The revelation that "time didn't slow for the world—it slowed for the witness" effectively reframes the conflict. The final dissolution carries clear cost, though the middle section could tighten pressure further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the interplay of permanence/impermanence, with disappearing ink serving as both literal tool and metaphor for consciousness. The ending's insight about choosing "how you vanish" resonates without moralizing. The drone's final calculation adds a chilling counter-perspective on human transcendence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines scientific precision ("titanium wings," "synaptic time") with poetic imagery ("ghostwing," "honey-thick seconds"). POV control remains stable with selective perception reflecting the tracker's analytical nature. Minor repetition in descriptive patterns ("not X, but Y") slightly dulls impact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong moments like "serene anger—not rage, not despair, but a quiet, molten fury" demonstrate controlled prose. However, repetitive "not X, but Y" constructions appear throughout, creating template cadence. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("labyrinth of synaptic time") without full payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of tracking time dilation through disappearing ink patterns offers genuine freshness, particularly the neural collapse parallel. The tracker's albino status and relationship with Ghostwing avoid cliché through specific detail. The dissolution ending takes real narrative risk that mostly succeeds.</comment>
