<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cartographer's quiet drive and obsessive dedication are embodied through concrete actions—etching names in her whistle, refining notation systems for seventeen seasons, climbing the ridge at midnight. Internal contradiction manifests in her electric certainty versus the city's dismissal, though peak moments could show more simultaneous impulses rather than sequential ones.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-breaking closure when the watcher turns—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights all prior observation. Cost is legible in becoming "another name whispered through reed whistles at dusk," though the final choice to climb lacks immediate on-page consequence beyond declaration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city geography constrains movement through the rusted gate and ridge-climbing requirements, while the reed whistle functions as micro-setting that shapes tactics. Sensory hierarchy reflects the cartographer's obsession—"each groove a street, each ridge a district"—with environment actively forcing her midnight ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (breaking the watchers' silence) escalates from theory to proof when one turns its head, narrowing options to direct confrontation. The "electric certainty" and willingness to join the lost expedition shows clear cost, though the final confrontation remains prospective rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the pattern language concept—communication beyond official channels, silence as both oppression and potential. The final image of becoming either decoder or legend reweights the entire system of watching/being watched without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—"spiral-shell cartographer," "each groove a street," perception filtered through mapping consciousness. Voice maintains lyric density under pressure with controlled rhythm, though some passages edge toward purple ("tectonic stone grinding against stone").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The whistle's melody wasn't music—it was a pattern language." Minor metaphor strain in "spirals that collapsed inward like failed lungs" and occasional elevated diction ("electric certainty") that slightly exceeds the established register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography, musical linguistics, and turtle-city worldbuilding creates non-obvious specificity. The pattern language as breath-based code and watchers as salt-and-shadow statues avoid generic fantasy tropes through particular detail.</comment>
