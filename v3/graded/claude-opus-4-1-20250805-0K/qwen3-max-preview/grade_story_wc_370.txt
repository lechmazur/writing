<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's compassionate nature manifests through concrete actions (sensing which volumes "wept, which laughed") and her internal conflict between empathy and the Society's logic-driven values creates genuine tension. The final choice to read aloud to empty chairs demonstrates earned transformation with visible cost—she risks discovery and judgment. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "unorthodox empathy" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elira transforms exile into sanctuary through self-acceptance, with clear cost (seven winters of isolation, risk of Society's judgment at dawn). The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward her stance crystallization. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some opacity around the Society's actual nature/purpose beyond "secret sanctum."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The library setting actively constrains and enables choices—books that "whisper dissent," shelves that "exhale" in response to truth. Strong micro-setting work with the crumpled invitation as physical anchor. Minor deduction for some abstract descriptors ("cathedral," "sanctum") that could be more concretely rendered, though the magical realism register partially justifies this.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Central stake (belonging vs. self-exile) signals early and deepens when the invitation reveals her self-address, forcing confrontation with past choices. The cost is legible—seven winters of isolation, risk of judgment. Slight deduction because the external pressure remains mostly internal until the implied dawn arrival; more concrete opposition would strengthen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the paradox shelf metaphor and "staying while leaving" concept—holding contradiction without fracture. The final image of reading to empty chairs resonantly answers the central question about belonging without stating a moral. Strong subtext throughout, particularly in the invitation being self-addressed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled register ("gilt edges dulled by dust," "wisdom often blooms brightest in the compost of error"). POV remains stable with appropriate access to Elira's interiority. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("enlarged tranquility") but mostly serves the lyrical mode. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density high in descriptive passages. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("liquid silver" moonlight), some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("holding space for stories"), and minor template cadence in the middle section with repetitive "She had..." constructions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-sanctuary with the specific twist of paradoxical texts and self-imposed exile. The self-addressed invitation is genuinely surprising yet inevitable in hindsight. The "staying while leaving" paradox offers a non-obvious angle on belonging. Slight deduction for some familiar magical library tropes, though well-executed.</comment>
