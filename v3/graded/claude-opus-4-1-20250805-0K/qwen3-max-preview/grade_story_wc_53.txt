<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal contradiction between past ambition and present scavenging is embodied through concrete action (collecting fragments, photographing nothing) and culminates in the earned renunciation of regret. The ghost negotiation externalizes internal conflict effectively, though some introspective passages edge toward diagnostic self-awareness ("I regret believing that ambition was a ladder, not a carousel").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the final Conceptual Repricing ("You were never meant to fix the past — only to frame it") landing with clear conceptual cost. The chronological confusion is taught early and pays off through the layered memory contradictions, though orientation of the physical space remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon's suspended carousel creates atmospheric pressure, and the camera becomes a constraining tool that shapes the final confrontation. However, the setting could more actively constrain choices mid-story rather than serving primarily as surreal backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation of collected fragments toward the ghost confrontation, with the camera exchange marking a decisive shift. The cost is conceptually clear (accepting inability to fix the past) though the emotional price could be more viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The framing metaphor (camera/development/exposure) brilliantly reweights the entire narrative at closure without stating its moral. The theme emerges organically from the specific accumulation of fragments and the final realization transforms retrospectively all the collecting and photographing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and strong perceptual signature ("boots crunching on salt-crusted planks that remember music"). The chronological confusion is elegantly handled through parallel contradictory memories, though occasional passages drift toward elevated register ("fractured stillness," "calcified in abandoned ticket stubs").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and purposeful compression, but some overwriting appears ("kinetic lagoon," "resolute scavenger," "calcified laughter"). Template cadence emerges in the "I regret" sequence and the metaphor density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ghost-as-past-self negotiation and the expired camera photographing echoes show genuine originality. The chronological confusion as subjective experience rather than magical effect is fresh, though the ambition-as-carousel insight feels somewhat familiar.</comment>
