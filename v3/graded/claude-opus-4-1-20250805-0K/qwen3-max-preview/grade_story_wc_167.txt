<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glazier's motivation to "illuminate value in the mundane" drives consistent micro-choices throughout, from stone-dropping to prism placement at Widow Hargrove's. His observational nature manifests in embodied perception ("vibrating up through the stone, into his bones") rather than abstract reflection. The choice to consecrate rather than escape the mundane carries visible cost in his isolation ("Others called him odd") and physical wear ("knees protesting").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through layered imagery (prism/rings/light) culminating in the Resonant Reconfiguration of taking the prism to transform Hargrove's view. Cost is felt in his accepted isolation and the ephemeral nature of his work ("rings...faded now, absorbed back into the whole"). The piece teaches its meditative pattern early and pays it off, though the stakes could tighten more decisively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting functions as both constraint and resource: dawn's liminal hour enables his practice, mist softens edges for transformation, the pier's dampness grounds embodiment. The prism-as-micro-setting constrains his method and charges the final image of transforming "laundry lines and cobblestones into a gallery." Sensory hierarchy reflects his glazier's attention to light and fracture patterns throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding sacred geometry in the mundane—deepens through the stone-drop sequence where physics becomes "messages, a dialect of nature's silent ledger." Escalation is textural rather than causal, building through accumulated observations toward the choice to transform Hargrove's window. Cost appears in his acceptance of being "odd" and the transient nature of his reckonings, though a sharper tightening would strengthen impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the glazier's practice: "not to escape the mundane, but to consecrate it." The father's shipwright wisdom about scars telling stories resonates through the glazier's attention to fractures becoming focal points. The ending image of transforming ordinary views into "living stained glass" offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the glazier notices light's behavior, fractures, and patterns others miss ("how light bent around flaws"). Voice modulates effectively from meditative observation to sensory immediacy ("A cormorant landed nearby, shaking droplets"). Free indirect style is clean, maintaining close psychic distance that deepens during the stone-drop sequence without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Pearl Bay at dawn was never silent, but this morning it whispered"). Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("noctilucent reckonings") but remains voice-consistent. Minor template cadence appears mid-piece ("He remembered...He smiled...He rose") but doesn't touch closure. Rhythm varies purposefully between long meditative sentences and short anchoring beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The glazier-as-mystic-physicist offers a fresh angle on the craftsman archetype, finding "sacred geometry" through observation rather than faith. The specific synthesis of light-work, physics, and spiritual seeking feels organic. However, the meditative harbor observer working with light echoes familiar literary territory, limiting higher scoring despite strong execution.</comment>
