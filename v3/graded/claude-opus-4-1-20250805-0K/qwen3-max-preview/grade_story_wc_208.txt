<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "scaffold complexity with simplicity" drives concrete choices throughout, from carving the nested archway to teaching villagers. Her perpetual learning manifests in actions (returning weekly to add figures) rather than labels. The final communal transformation earns its cost through accumulated gestures, though some interior passages lean toward articulated wisdom rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully—villagers shift from GPS-dependence to archway-gathering, with the sculpture becoming a "living archive." The accumulative lens holds as layered meanings build through the magic slide's shifting tableau, Elara's carving, and the community's ongoing contributions. Minor deduction for the slightly extended denouement after the core transformation completes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway functions as both literal shelter and metaphorical frame for the nested carving, with rain needling scalp and wind tugging sleeves grounding the physical struggle. The magic lantern slide's shifting projections constrain Elara's artistic choices. The archway's stone ribs vibrating in molars is particularly visceral, though some passages prioritize thematic resonance over sensory immediacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure builds through the storm's intensification and Elara's internal turbulence ("deadlines, critics, pressure to monetize"), culminating in her choice to leave the sculpture as communal property. The cost is visible in her ongoing weekly returns and additions rather than claiming ownership. The stakes deepen through layered historical gestures, though the external conflict could press harder on her artistic choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the nested archways (physical/carved/projected) and recurring hand-clasps across eras, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of villagers walking to the archway instead of panicking when GPS fails offers a non-literal answer to technology-versus-tradition. "Simplicity is not absence. It is architecture" crystallizes without explaining, letting accumulated imagery carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's voice maintains distinctive texture through compounds like "salt-crusted," "sea-smoothed," and "turbine-hum reverie," with perception filtered through her sculptor's attention to grain and negative space. The prose modulates effectively between action and reflection. Minor voice drift occurs in passages like "timewoven alliances" and "scaffold complexity," which edge toward conceptual abstraction beyond her established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control in storm passages ("Rain needled her scalp, wind tugged at her sleeves") with effective variation. Information density is high, particularly in the magic slide's transformations. Deductions for occasional abstraction loops ("gesture repeated, trust layered like sediment" followed by similar restatements) and some template phrasing in the community response section that dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide showing shifting historical hand-clasps across eras offers a fresh angle on connection-through-time. The nested archway concept (stone containing wood containing light) creates original structural resonance. The transformation from individual artist to communal archive-keeper subverts expected creative ownership narratives, though some elements (storm as emotional mirror) use familiar correlatives.</comment>
