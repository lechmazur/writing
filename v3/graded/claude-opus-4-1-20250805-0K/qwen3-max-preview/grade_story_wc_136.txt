<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to find "the fortress of unspoken truths" drives concrete choices through the vault descent, with her analytical-artistic nature manifesting in how she maps shame "without judgment, only geometry." The transformation from mapper to listener shows earned change with visible cost (the punch dissolving, being "remade"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around internal states ("trembling with certainty") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elira absorbs the chorus of truths and emerges "remade." Cost is visible (punch dissolves, self unravels) though the conceptual nature of the "fortress" being a chorus rather than place slightly dulls the physical stakes. Orientation anchors clearly (Elira, vault, midnight hour).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The vault's "arching ribs of stone" and corridors where "mist clung like regret" create atmosphere that shapes Elira's journey, with the obsidian door providing the crucial threshold. The cracks forming arrows effectively constrain her path and choices throughout. The setting transitions from physical vault to metaphysical space work well within the story's logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on Elira's singular drive to find the fortress, with meaningful escalation when she must "accept whatever truth emerged, even if it unraveled her." The pressure builds through accumulation rather than reversals, appropriate for the textural lens. Cost lands clearly (dissolution of self/punch) but the abstract nature of the conflict limits visceral tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the concrete journey: arrows don't point to secrets but to "readiness," and the fortress isn't a place but a surrender to truth. The final image of the silver needle "waiting for the next soul brave enough" resonantly reweights the entire journey without moralizing. Slight deduction for occasional abstraction ("the hour had not divided bad habits from new starts").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the lyrical mode, with strong perceptual signature in how Elira sees paths "like symphonies: each turn a note." Some overwrought constructions ("the cathedral of mist and starlight") and abstract phrasings ("trembling with certainty") occasionally muddy clarity. POV control remains stable throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("mirrors that reflected not her face, but her doubts") but suffers from overwriting in peak beats with mixed metaphors and elevated diction. Template cadence appears in places ("She'd mapped...She believed...She knelt"). Information density is high but clarity occasionally suffers from abstract constructions and conceptual language that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of mapping emotional/spiritual geography through physical cracks offers a fresh angle, with the phantom punch as memory-tool rather than function creating originality. The transformation of the fortress from place to chorus shows genuine ingenuity. Some elements feel overly abstract or symbolic rather than lived-in, preventing higher scoring.</comment>
