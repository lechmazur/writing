I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and rhythmic breathing toward a resonant capture/integration rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mirror maker's motivation is rooted in craft mastery and personal history ("She had once been that child"), with concrete embodied details like trembling hands and synchronized breathing. The final choice to press glass to dream shows earned renunciation of fear through patient method. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "boundaries" and "thresholds" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where dream flows into mirror "like ink into water," with visible cost in "her final craft" and the fog thickening again. The accumulative structure builds through breathing rhythm, sextant resonance, and apple blossoms to earn the integration moment. Slight deduction for the cost being more stated ("not because she would die") than dramatized in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric specificity with "rust, wet bark, and ozone" and "bruised violet sky." The broken sextant fragments create spatial constraint, apple blossoms emerge through light-touch, and the fog operates as active setting that thins/thickens in response. The environment directly enables the capture method through its "hollows" and twilight frost timing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on capturing the runaway dream with clear escalation through breathing synchronization, sextant levitation, and the dream's descent "not in fear, but in curiosity." The cost manifests in this being her "final craft" and the return of centuries-old fog. Good accumulative pressure though the exact price of success could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the mirror-as-threshold metaphor and the parallel between escaped dream and the child she once was. The final integration "like ink into water" offers a non-literal answer about boundaries dissolving through patient craft. Strong resonance between astronomer's failure and artisan's triumph without stating the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("not from cold but from the weight of her task"). The breathing cadence creates syntactic variation that mirrors the ritual's rhythm. Slight repetition in "She did not..." constructions works as intentional pattern. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("petrified sentinels") that edges toward purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "silver-scaled thing with eyes like molten mercury." Some figurative density in places ("glass mountains...that was the tone she carried in her marrow") and minor template cadence in the "She did not chant. She did not plead" sequence, though it serves rhythmic purpose. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mirror-making craft with dream-capture through the broken sextant as tuning device. The breathing method and "frequency whispered by a sleepwalker" show inventive specificity. The integration of failed astronomer's tool for new purpose and the dream as "nightmare-turned-wish" fleeing expectation demonstrate original angle. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure pays off (+0.3).</comment>
