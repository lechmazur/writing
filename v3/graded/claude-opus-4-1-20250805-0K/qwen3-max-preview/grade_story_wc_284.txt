I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor for a prestigious literary publication, applying the rigorous rubric provided.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece. The story builds through layered imagery and metaphor (burns literal and figurative, seasonal transitions, burial/planting motifs) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elira transforms from "burned spy" to "quiet gardener of justice."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("ache in her ribs where the burns still throbbed"). The transformation from spy to truth-planter is earned through accumulated detail, though some moments edge toward over-articulation ("ghost of justice"). Internal contradiction plays well in her choice to leave truth for uncertain discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost—she sacrifices potential vindication for a gamble on future discovery. The accumulative structure coheres through seasonal/burial metaphors. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the relay station's significance (~300 words).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bluff setting actively constrains choices ("testing footholds, letting the mist veil her"). Seasonal transition metaphor works throughout. The "codes in accumulated snow" method cleverly uses environment as both concealment and eventual revelation mechanism, though some descriptive passages lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize around choosing legacy over survival/revenge. The escalation through burial metaphor ("planted one—an act of quiet sabotage") provides meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in her acceptance that she may never see vindication, though middle tension could tighten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the burial/planting metaphor without explicit moralizing. The transformation of "unused courage" from something sought ahead to something "left behind, entrusted to the thaw" resonates. The final image of her becoming "compost for what would grow" avoids sentimentality while maintaining emotional truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("zephyr bluff in mist held its breath"). POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Some register elevation in peak moments ("vouchsafe the last truth") fits the elegiac tone but occasionally strains against naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("her name no longer ash, but compost"). Deductions for occasional overwriting ("silver hush" appears twice) and some template cadence in middle paragraphs ("She had been... She walked... She had spent"). Information density is good but uneven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spy thriller and nature writing creates unexpected resonance. The concept of codes dissolving through seasonal melt is inventive. The transformation from destruction (burning) to creation (planting) offers genuine insight, though some metaphors feel slightly overwrought.</comment>
