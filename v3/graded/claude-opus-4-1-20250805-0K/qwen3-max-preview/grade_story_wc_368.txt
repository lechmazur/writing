<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dye master's internal journey from seeking external magnetism to cultivating her own fractures shows strong character evolution with embodied details (tracking sun trails with breath and memory). The donor heart creates genuine internal conflict between borrowed courage and authentic existence. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "magnetism" that could be more embodied in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural design with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the dye master shifts from seeking to replicate others' magnetism to cultivating her own fractures as "apertures." Cost is visible in the fabric's effect on patrons (weeping, children whispering). The lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern revelations about light's oblique angles.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating tea house setting directly constrains and enables the protagonist's observations, providing both isolation and proximity to subjects. Micro-settings (wing's scales, silk ropes tethered to belief) function as active elements shaping discovery. The valley mist in the final image charges the closure with atmospheric resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulative discoveries: wing's oblique brilliance → old man's refractive quietness → cultivating personal fractures. The progression from external observation to internal transformation shows clear escalation under the textural lens. Cost manifests in the emotional responses to the final fabric, though the middle section could tighten pressure between discoveries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the morpho wing's structural color (not pigment but lattice) paralleling how story-magnetism isn't painted on but woven in. The final insight about broken places that gleam offers a resonant, non-literal answer to why some magnetize stories. No moralizing; complexity preserved through the paradox of iridescent caution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyrical register and strong perceptual signature (tracking light fractals, mapping with breath). Syntax modulates effectively between meditation and revelation. Minor repetition of "quietly explosive" feels slightly forced; some sentences in the middle stretch toward purple prose but recover for closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specific detail and good information density. Template cadence appears in lines 13-15 with repeated "She [verb]" structures (-0.4). Some paraphrase loops around magnetism concepts in the middle third (-0.2). Final passages achieve excellent propulsion with concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of craft mastery, organ donation, and lepidopteran optics creates an original meditation on authenticity. The concept of "fractures as apertures" and magnetism through oblique angles shows genuine ingenuity. The floating tea house tethered by belief adds imaginative risk without obscuring clarity.</comment>
