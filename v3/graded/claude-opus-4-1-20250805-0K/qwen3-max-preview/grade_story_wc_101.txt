<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is consistently rooted in her doctrine of anonymous care, with internal conflict between revealing herself and maintaining the spell of mystery. The final bell-ringing crystallizes collective agency with visible cost (sanctions deepening, resources scarce). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "intergenerational support" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern teaching (nightly runs, anonymous gifts) that deepens through community adoption of the practice. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the bell transforms from silent promise to voiced declaration with clear cost (sanctions persist, resources thin). The "passed into other hands" ending crystallizes Charged Poise with options legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor functions as anchor point for community gathering and bell placement, constraining movement patterns. Sensory detail selective ("frost feathered the ridge," "steam curling from clay bowls") and POV-filtered through Elira's nocturnal routine. Environment doesn't quite constrain the pivotal choice, keeping it below 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (maintaining anonymous solidarity under sanctions) deepens through others joining the practice, with meaningful tightening as resources dwindle yet distribution expands. Cost is legible in "heavier baskets," rationed fuel, vanished imports. The bell-ringing marks stance crystallization with visible price, though agency could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bell's transformation from smuggled relic to shared signature to final declaration. "Anyone can ring it. Anyone can answer it" offers non-literal answer to survival-through-solidarity question. The three morning baskets with coins pressed into dough create resonant closure without stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance, modulating between Elira's intimate thoughts and wider community observation. Perceptual signature evident in how she notices doorsteps, footsteps, basket weight. Some elevated diction ("terra-cotta arbor," "amplified quiet") occasionally drifts from established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some abstract phrasing ("quiet currency of care," "intergenerational support") dulls immediacy. Information density high in action sequences. Minor template cadence in middle section listing what others began doing. No major artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on resistance narrative through anonymous mutual aid rather than confrontation. The bell's evolution from silent promise to shared signature to singular declaration shows specific synthesis. Risk in choosing quiet persistence over dramatic action, though execution could push further into unexplored territory.</comment>
