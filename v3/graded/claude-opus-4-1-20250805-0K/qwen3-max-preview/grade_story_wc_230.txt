<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to cultivate psychological safety drives meaningful choices throughout, from sharing truffles to releasing the glass eye. Internal contradictions manifest beautifully in her struggle between involuntary truthfulness and learned occlusion. The final transformation from "silence no longer armor but invitation" represents earned character change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through sensory density and pattern shifts to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she releases the relic and transforms her relationship to truth. The cost is felt in her surrender of control—"letting safety grow wild and unowned." Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hanging orchard setting actively constrains choices—bridges sway, branches fall into the gorge, creating genuine physical danger that mirrors emotional precarity. Sensory details like "fruit hung like forgotten chimes, half-rotted from neglect" serve both atmosphere and theme. The mycelium network becomes micro-setting that enables the truffle harvest and metaphorically grounds the story's exploration of connection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on psychological safety in a post-virus world where empathy has become contagion. Meaningful escalation occurs when the three traumatized figures arrive seeking help, forcing the protagonist to navigate her truthfulness curse. The cost manifests in her releasing the glass eye—surrendering her coping mechanism to help others.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mycelium metaphor of underground connection and the contrast between occlusion and truth. The ending's image of foraging "for moments—fragile, fleeting, luminous" reweights the entire journey from survival to surrender. Subtext operates beautifully in gestures like placing the eye in the hollow tree.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines scientific precision ("amygdala's scream") with lyrical imagery ("orchard sighing behind her like a lung finally emptied of grief"). POV control remains steady throughout with selective perception reflecting the forager's expertise. Dialogue effectively shows the visitors' trauma through indirect speech: "Please, wrap it in shadow. Say it slant."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The glass eye, cool against her thigh" simultaneously provides sensory detail, object tracking, and emotional state. Some minor repetition in "occluded" variants but serves thematic purpose. Strong rhythm variation supports the contemplative pace.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of an empathy virus creating involuntary truthfulness offers genuine freshness, executed through specific world-building rather than abstraction. The transformation of truffles from luxury food to neural medicine shows creative reconfiguration. Risk-taking in the lyrical, non-traditional structure heightens rather than obscures meaning (+0.3 within band).</comment>
