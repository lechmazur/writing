<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cartographer's motivation to discover "what walls dream about" and whether stone can forgive creates a compelling internal drive that propels her actions. Her inheritance of sensitivity manifests concretely through listening "with the hollow behind her ribs," and her choice to leave her sketch with the diaries shows meaningful renunciation with cost. The character lacks sharp internal contradiction in peak moments, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the cartographer's decision to leave her sketch with the diaries, passing on rather than carrying the burden alone. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently as density increases through diary fragments and wall-listening, culminating in the final exhale of the passage. Cost is visible in "her satchel lighter, her heart heavier."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage creates atmospheric pressure through tactile details like "cold flagstone" and "moss and shattered brick," with the environment constraining choices (locals avoid the bent corridor). The fireplace discovery and moonlight beam through the broken roof directly enable the story's closure. Some sensory details remain generic ("bruised twilight sky") rather than POV-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what walls remember—deepens through the diary discovery, forcing a choice between recording and witnessing. The cartographer's decision to leave her work behind forecloses her original mapping purpose with clear cost. Escalation could be stronger; the middle lacks a sharp tightening moment that would elevate the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of passing on burden "lightly, tenderly, like a secret whispered into the ear of stone." The diaries' fragments about mapping "not the land, but the loss inside it" resonate without moralizing. The final image of walls dreaming alongside the cartographer offers a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a distinctive lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("not by choice, but by inheritance") and purposeful compression. The perceptual signature shows in selective details like feeling walls "vibrate in your bones." Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("bruised twilight sky," "curled like unborn birds") without full POV grounding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs ("The ivy here was older than the passage itself"). Minor figurative excess appears ("curled like a sleeping serpent," "curled like unborn birds" creates repetition) and some abstract phrasing ("legacy's burden") lacks concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of a "corridor echo cartographer" who maps emotional resonance in walls offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic exploration. The specific detail of half-burned diaries as offerings rather than discards shows original thinking. The execution relies on some familiar post-climate-disaster tropes without fully transforming them through lived detail.</comment>
