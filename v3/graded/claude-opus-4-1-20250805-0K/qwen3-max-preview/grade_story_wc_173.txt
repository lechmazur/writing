<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The courtesan's motivation—returning echoes to break conformity's lullaby—drives consistent action through the untangling sequence with clear internal stakes. Her choice to wear "armor woven from solitude" and work with "alarming serenity" shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final renunciation (stepping back, leaving no prints) carries visible cost as she gives up the harvest she unlocked.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure as the harvest of echoes spills outward, transforming the courtyard from silver silence to "alive with murmurs." The cost is legible: she unlocks voices but steps away without claiming them, becoming "keeper of the defiant hum." Early orientation anchors who/where/when clearly ("chaste courtesan stood barefoot in the silver courtyard under snow").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary constrains her method (must untangle threads with patience/rhythm) and the silver courtyard's snow becomes active participant (settling "like benedictions," trembling midair when echoes release). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("breath curling like script," "threads of silver and shadow coiled like sleeping serpents"). Setting directly shapes the final transformation as the courtyard glows "not from starlight, but from memory given motion."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through thread-untangling as each release builds pressure—from a sigh to a giggle to the final knot "weighted with a thousand suppressed confessions." The dominant stake (liberating suppressed voices) tightens when she must whisper "I remember you" to dissolve the final barrier. Cost is visible but the conflict relies heavily on symbolic resistance rather than active opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the harvest metaphor without stating a moral: silence can be "reaped and stored," echoes are "spectral seeds." The final image of the courtesan as "poet of the unsaid, weaver of the unraveled" offers a non-literal answer about art's role in preserving what authority silences. Her smile "not of triumph, but of homecoming" resists tidy resolution while maintaining thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout ("breath curling like script," "fingers pale as moonlit parchment") with consistent lyric elevation that matches the courtesan's poetic nature. Psychic distance modulates effectively from external description to intimate revelation ("She wished to return the echoes to the wind"). No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice remains coherent through metaphorical perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, but abstract phrasing occasionally dulls immediacy ("alarming serenity was her mantle now"). Some metaphor density in high-pressure beats without clear payoff ("threads were not merely obstacles; they were guardians"). Opening and closing lines strongly anchor voice and recharge motifs. Template cadence appears briefly ("She had come here... She had never taken... She defied them...") but doesn't pervade.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of harvesting echoes as physical threads offers a fresh angle on memory/voice preservation. The courtesan as both chaste and defiant transforms the archetype through specific details (barefoot in snow, armor of solitude). Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens meaning, though some symbolic elements (prism as frozen tears) lean toward familiar territory.</comment>
