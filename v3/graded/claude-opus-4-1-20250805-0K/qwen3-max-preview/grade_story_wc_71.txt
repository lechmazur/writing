<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to understand living houses and sanctify architectural memory is consistently rendered through concrete action and embodied ritual. Her internal conflict between tracking normality's creep versus honoring it creates genuine tension. The final choice to "walk beside it" rather than defeat it represents earned character evolution with visible cost—the vanished cottage finally releases its grip.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered sensory detail until the orris root's placement triggers a resonant reconfiguration—the cottage's ghost unclenches. Closure lands through Earned Stasis as she accepts her role as perpetual sanctifier. Cost is visible in the dissolved shard and the cottage's release, though the exact stakes of "creeping normality" remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bay setting and orris root shard function as micro-settings that constrain the ritual—placement on wet stone, dissolution by dawn's tide. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "salt-kissed air," "moss-slick stone," though some descriptions edge toward overwrought ("butter-yellow glow"). The vanished cottage's ghostly presence effectively layers temporal settings.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sanctifying forgotten architectures—deepens when the protagonist senses the specific cottage "pulsed" with unresolved presence. The ritual's completion releases the cottage's grip, a meaningful if quiet resolution. However, escalation relies more on accumulation than active pressure, and the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of placing displaced objects to honor vanished spaces—memory as physical architecture. The final image of continuing to sanctify "not to preserve, but to honor" offers a non-literal answer to why houses feel alive. Subtext operates effectively through the orris root's "ghost-notes" and the cottage's persistent swing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm and selective perception fitting the protagonist's role as "noticer." Phrases like "silence pooled like spilled ink" and "hushed blaze" create distinct texture. Some passages drift toward purple prose ("breadcrumbs for the soul"), and occasional filter constructions dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty—"reeds whispered secrets to the tide"—with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, overwrought figurative language appears too frequently ("butter-yellow glow," "pollen to the inside of her ribs"), and some phrases edge toward template mysticism. The closing suffers from slight redundancy in restating the sanctification mission.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of a "creeping normality noticer" who sanctifies thresholds through displaced objects offers a fresh angle on memory and place. The specific synthesis of perfumery, architecture, and ritual creates originality. However, the mystical threshold-keeper archetype is somewhat familiar, and the resolution's wisdom about honoring rather than preserving feels earned but not surprising.</comment>
