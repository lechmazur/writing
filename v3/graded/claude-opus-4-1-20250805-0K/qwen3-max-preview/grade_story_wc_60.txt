I'll evaluate this story through the lens of Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds meaning through layered imagery and sensory accumulation rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The luminous skeptic's characterization succeeds through consistent internal logic—her method of "plausible miracle" and "scientific ghost" creates genuine complexity. The moment at Fountain Twelve where she kneels and uses the key shows embodied agency with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("sidereal patience") that occasionally replaces concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the first fountain's single drop crystallizes the city's transformation. The accumulative structure coheres well—each fountain visit builds toward liberation with clear cost (the city's "defiant hush" replacing absence). Orientation anchors by ~120 words. The lens holds consistently as textural accumulation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains and enables—the dry fountains aren't backdrop but the mechanism of memory storage. The brass key "tarnished green, half-buried in silt" exemplifies selective, purposeful detail. The final fountain's gurgle directly results from environmental interaction, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on liberation of trapped memories with clear escalation from individual fountain to city-wide transformation. The "slap of bare feet on wet stone" and weeping old man show concrete cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when memories pour out "as scent, warmth, vibration." Slightly limited by the protagonist's lack of personal risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between forgetting as "fate" versus "failure." The stained glass box as memory container and the fountains as "dry throats" create resonant imagery without explicit moralizing. The ending's single drop offers a non-literal answer about renewal through remembering.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"fountains were dry throats choked with moss and silence." The perceptual signature remains consistent: she sees breadcrumbs others miss, maps acoustics where others see ghosts. Rhythm modulates effectively between meditative passages and active moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong figurative control with purposeful imagery ("trapped auroras," "sidereal patience"). Information density high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, and concept simultaneously. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("liberation was not hers to claim") and slight register elevation in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The "luminous skeptic" who believes in "realistically imaginative" solutions offers a fresh take on the mystical liberator trope. The specific synthesis of scientific method with magical result feels earned. The breadcrumb trail of "cobalt paint," "chalk arrow," "scent of lilac" creates memorable specificity.</comment>
