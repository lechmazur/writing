<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The deckhand's resilient positivity drives genuine choices under pressure (whistling while scrubbing despite witnessing vanishings, descending alone into the grotto). His motivation crystallizes clearly ("every soul aboard deserved a single, solid world") and the final renunciation of permanence ("permanence was never the goal—transience was the truth") carries visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("patterns, once understood, could always be reknit") that lacks full embodiment in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the merging of seven ferries and the deckhand's acceptance of "permanent transience" reconfigures the entire premise with felt cost. The pattern accumulates through vanishings, grotto discoveries, radio tuning, and harmonic beacons, each deepening understanding. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (the supernatural premise takes time to clarify) though this serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The spectral grotto functions as active setting—phosphorescent pebbles, coral arches pulsing with forgotten tides, stalactites dripping liquid starlight that enable the solution. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("ozone and memory," "bioluminescent eels swam in synchronized orbits"). Deduction for some abstract descriptors ("permanent transience") and occasional vagueness in spatial transitions between ferry/grotto/surface.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate clearly through accumulation: seven vanishings → discovering the radio → mapping patterns → leaving harmonic beacons → final convergence. The deckhand's agency drives each deepening ("he tuned it by instinct," "began leaving messages"). Cost is visible in the ferries' passengers' "bewildered relief" and the deckhand's acceptance that "timelines would fray again."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the hourglass's "sand finally trickling upward" and the paradox of "permanent transience"—stability requires accepting instability. The final image of "ghostly ripples only he could see" offers a non-literal answer about hidden connections between worlds. Minor deduction for occasionally abstract phrasing ("transience was the truth") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with strong perceptual signature ("salt spray misted his sun-browned face," seeing patterns others miss). Purposeful compression works well for the accumulative design. Deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't fully match the deckhand POV ("temporal pressure peaked," "oscillating between parallel timelines") and some abstract constructions in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Strong moments like "bioluminescent eels swam in synchronized orbits above his head, tracing equations he didn't need to solve—only to feel." Deductions for abstract phrases ("permanent transience" appears multiple times), some template constructions ("He didn't X. Didn't Y."), and occasional register drift into technical language.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of maritime work with quantum mechanics creates genuine originality—ferries "oscillating between parallel timelines" transformed through a deckhand's patient labor. The hourglass with sand trickling upward and the radio tuning "frequencies that vibrated not in sound but in sensation" offer specific, memorable details. The commitment to "permanent transience" as resolution shows conceptual boldness.</comment>
