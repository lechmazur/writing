<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal journey from shattered courage to reconstituted purpose drives meaningful change through concrete embodied details like the crystal warming in her palm. The character's motivations are consistent and deepen through specific memories (the girl hiding in libraries) that earn the final stance. Minor deduction for some abstract passages about peace/violence that edge toward therapy-speak without full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist transforms from enforcer to witness, with visible cost in accepting brokenness ("It wasn't whole. It never would be. But it was enough"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as mirrors accumulate glimpses that reweight her understanding of peace. Orientation anchors (lighthouse orchard, ice floes) establish by ~120 words. Deduction for some causality softness in how mirror-glimpses mechanically work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice creates atmospheric pressure that mirrors internal instability, with ice groaning "like ancient beasts" effectively charging the environment. Mirrors hung in skeletal apple trees provide concrete spatial choreography. The setting actively participates in closure when ice reveals "hidden channels, new paths." Minor deduction for some generic coastal details that don't fully leverage the unique setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconstituting courage through witnessing humanity—escalates from personal healing to collective possibility as she prepares to carry this practice forward. The ice shifting from threat to possibility provides meaningful deepening. However, external pressure remains somewhat abstract; the conflict is primarily internal without concrete opposition testing her methods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the crystal fragment as "lens for seeing humanity" and mirrors holding "courageous anomalies." The final question "What if we choose differently?" resonates without moralizing, reweighting all prior glimpses. The concept of peace as "presence of choice" rather than "absence of violence" provides genuine complexity. Slight deduction for one instance of abstract philosophizing about mercy/vengeance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong lyrical voice with distinctive texture in phrases like "shadow-laced peacekeeper" and "weighted breath before reply." POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. The prose rhythm effectively modulates between contemplative passages and sharper sensory moments. Deduction for occasional register elevation that strains against the established voice ("reconstitute," "anomalies").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery like "frost crunching," "mirrors caught the light, each one holding a fragment of courage." Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("map empathy onto action," "reconstitute purpose") and repetitive use of "weighted breath" formula reduce clarity. Some template cadence in the mirror-glimpse sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The conceit of a peacekeeper using mirrors to witness humanity's micro-moments offers a fresh angle on post-war healing. The specific detail of vintage store mirrors and the lighthouse-as-beacon-for-reflection transforms familiar elements. However, the core peace/war dichotomy and healing-through-witnessing arc follow recognizable patterns without sufficient transformation.</comment>
