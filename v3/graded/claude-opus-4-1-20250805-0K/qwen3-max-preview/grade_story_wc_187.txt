I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and reflection toward a resonant reconfiguration where the archivist becomes an archive herself.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation to "sculpt identity from experience" drives consistent choices through examining shadows and measuring grief. Her preemptive nostalgia creates genuine internal contradiction, especially in "preemptively nostalgic for her own eventual erasure." Minor deduction for some abstract emotional states ("heart ached") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the archivist transforms from recorder to archive ("the deepening hush now inside her — not as emptiness, but as archive"). Cost is visible in her acceptance of eventual erasure and the weight of carrying others' memories. The piece teaches its pattern early through shadow-measuring and memory-reading.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of setting as active force — the crystal forecourt literally holds and whispers collective memory, shadows reveal emotional duration, solid fog creates isolation. The observatory functions as altar, the Arch of Unfinished Questions' impossibly short shadow suggests "time itself had flinched." Environment directly shapes her method and final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from measuring one shadow to many, from recording facts to embodying memories, from observer to vessel. The dominant stake — preserving/resurrecting lost civilizations — deepens as she physically absorbs their memories ("vibrations climb her calves, up her spine"). Cost visible in her acceptance of erasure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the central metaphor of shadow-lengths measuring grief duration. The ending offers a resonant answer about memory and identity without stating it: she becomes what she sought to preserve. "She signed her name not at the bottom of the page, but along the edge of a raindrop's refraction" perfectly encapsulates ephemeral permanence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism — "summer-quill archivist," "stormlit observatory," "preemptively nostalgic." POV maintains consistent distance with selective perception focused on shadows, memory, and atmospheric detail. The prose rhythm modulates effectively, accelerating during the writing sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("solid fog cracked faintly underfoot, chiming like frozen bells"). Some overwriting in extended metaphorical sequences ("shadow lengths...like slow hands of a clock counting griefs") and occasional abstract phrasing ("deepening hush"). Information density is high but momentum occasionally slows during descriptive passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of archaeology, meteorology, and emotional anthropology. The concept of measuring shadow-lengths to understand extinct civilizations' grief is genuinely fresh. The transformation of weather phenomena into memory storage, and the archivist becoming an archive herself, shows exceptional imaginative integration.</comment>
