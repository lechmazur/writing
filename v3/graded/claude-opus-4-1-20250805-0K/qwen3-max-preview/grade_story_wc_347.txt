I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural drive lens, as it builds through layered detail and pattern rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The caretaker's resignation and arithmetic motivation ("refused to let the chorus grow louder") create authentic interiority. His indirect rescue method reveals character through specific actions rather than declaration. Minor deduction for the girl's somewhat stock presence, though her "annoyed at the ground" observation adds texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the caretaker returns to "assembling tomorrow's invisible path" with visible cost. The nut-as-memory-key and curse mechanics are well-established. Slight ambiguity in how exactly the girl escapes despite following his trails prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cursed orchard with mechanical birds and frost-triggered maze creates genuine constraint. Details like "silver sap" and "clockwork currents" are specific and atmospheric. The nut's microscopic blueprint constrains the caretaker's navigation choices, elevating the setting beyond decoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize around preventing another ghost joining the chorus, with frost as temporal pressure. The caretaker's indirect guidance method shows agency under constraint. The cost is more implied than visceral in the rescue sequence itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the pattern of "offhandedly exact" care—precision disguised as indifference. The final image of mutual sighing between caretaker and orchard resonates without stating a moral. The nut-as-burden passed to the girl reweights earlier passages about inheritance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm ("brittle shale," "brass-winged and hollow-eyed"). The caretaker's perceptual signature filters everything through weary precision. Clean focalization throughout with purposeful compression that serves the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("whistled—not a tune, but a sequence of pauses and pitches"). Strong syntactic variety and precise word choice. Minor repetition of "offhandedly exact" feels purposeful rather than artifactual.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The indirect rescue method and memory-encoded nut show genuine ingenuity. The mechanical birds as passive observers rather than active threats subverts expectation. Some familiar fantasy elements (cursed orchard, labyrinth) prevent higher scoring despite fresh execution.</comment>
