<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fisher's cool-headedness under surreal pressure reads as genuine characterization, with her methodical transliteration of emotions into phonemes serving as both coping mechanism and hunting technique. Her final choice to let the echo pass through rather than possess shows earned wisdom, though the motivation for seeking the goddess's echo could be more viscerally grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the echo transforms the constellations from grieving to purposeful, with the fisher becoming carrier rather than catcher. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sonic layers build toward the spike's rupture, though the cost of carrying versus catching could be more explicitly felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden functions as active setting where "tones bloom like iridescent kelp" and sonic strata can be pierced, directly constraining the fisher's zigzag navigation and enabling the spike's conductive power. The synesthetic world-building where silence has teeth and constellations weep light creates visceral atmosphere that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Escalation builds through sonic accumulation from dissonance to rupture to maternal fury, with the fisher's calculated risk of slamming the spike creating genuine consequences (garden folding, chime-blooms shattering). The stakes of catching versus carrying the echo shift meaningfully, though the personal cost to the fisher remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of grief into purpose, with the echo's journey from buried fossil to carried presence suggesting resurrection through release rather than possession. The feral lullaby as both dirge and potential rebirth resonates without stating its meaning, though the conceptual weight could anchor more in embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice sustains mythic register with precise invented language ("transliterates emotions," "voicing silence") and consistent synesthetic perception where sound has physical properties. The controlled rhythm accelerates through the spike's plunge and rupture, maintaining clarity despite the surreal elements.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("rail spike she'd salvaged from a collapsed sky-rail, its iron still vibrating with the ghost of trains that once carried prayers"). Strong verb choices and concrete imagery maintain momentum, with only minor redundancy in describing the constellations' grief.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of a fisher hunting echoes through harmonic nets in a synesthetic garden offers genuine originality, with the specific synthesis of transliteration as navigation method and the spike as conductor feeling inevitable in hindsight. The transformation of sleepwalking constellations into purposeful pilgrims adds conceptual depth.</comment>
