<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "capture the sound of trust breaking" is distinctive and drives concrete actions through multiple failed attempts. Her internal complexity shows in the tension between fear calcified into purpose and her calculated retreats. The final choice to reveal the watch fob carries visible cost through Marla's frozen recognition and The Chain's flight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the watch fob's revelation, which shatters the deal without violence—the trust breaks through memory and recognition. The causal chain from failed disguises to final confrontation builds coherently. Cost is legible in the "brittle snap of trust shattering" and the dissolution of the criminal alliance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath Pier Seven creates vivid constraint through "salt-rotted shadows," "groaning timbers," and specific details like "bottled ghosts" and "crab-claw ink." The watch fob functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its lighthouse keeper history charges the final confrontation. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from observation through two failed infiltration attempts to the final calculated revelation. The protagonist's agency drives the climax through her choice to deploy the watch fob at the precise moment. Cost is visible in The Chain's retreat and the market holding its breath—though the protagonist walks away unharmed, limiting full cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "the sound of trust breaking"—not a crash but "the silence after Marla's exhale." The watch fob's history of betrayal during the Harbor Wars resonates with the present betrayal. The ending reweights the opening quest: she came for a sound and found it in silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through "salt-rotted shadows," "drunken fireflies," and the controlled rhythm that mirrors the protagonist's calculated movements. POV remains tightly controlled with selective perception focused on sounds and movement. Prose rhythm effectively modulates between tense observation and explosive action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"lanterns swaying like drunken fireflies" establishes setting while conveying instability. Some figurative density in places ("silence thicker now, like tar poured over whispers") but serves the atmosphere. Clean prose with varied sentence structures that maintain momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of smuggler's daughter with supernatural element of capturing abstract sounds creates original premise. The specific detail of failed disguises and the watch fob's lighthouse keeper history avoid generic crime fiction. Risk-taking in the quiet, non-violent resolution pays off thematically (+0.3 within band).</comment>
