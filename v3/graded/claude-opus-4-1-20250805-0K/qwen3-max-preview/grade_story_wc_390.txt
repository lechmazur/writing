<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's logical-emotional nature manifests through calculated resonance-matching while trembling with awe, showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her transformation from engineer to "keeper of balance" is earned through prior causality with visible cost (exhaustion, becoming a living buffer). However, the scavengers' instant conversion from malice to revelation through "harmonic grace" lacks credible psychological grounding, reading as convenient rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkage (ice sings → key vibrates → she descends → counters attack). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (exhaustion, transformation to guardian). The orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~120 words. However, the scavengers' motivations and the Heartstone's power system feel underdeveloped for the weight they carry at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina setting actively pressures choices through unstable plates requiring vibrational matching, while the lighthouse's bioluminescent spiral creates atmospheric specificity. The ice's transformation from resisting to guiding directly constrains her movement tactics. The sensory hierarchy effectively narrows during crisis (bones aching with purity, mercury rippling violently).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (protecting the Heartstone) is signaled early and tightens when sonic harpoons strike, forcing her counter-frequency response. Agency manifests through her choice to become "the living dam against sonic entropy" with visible cost. However, the scavengers pose minimal genuine threat—their instant conversion undermines the escalation's credibility, resolving too easily through "harmonic grace."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of answering violence with frequency/understanding emerges organically through the vibrational matching mechanics and sonic absolution. The final image of the protagonist as "keeper of balance" offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the resolution's moral tidiness (malice dissolved by grace) lacks complexity, and the phrase "logically emotional grace" edges toward explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with distinct perceptual signatures (ice as language, vibrational awareness). However, elevated diction occasionally drifts beyond plausible POV lexicon ("sonic entropy," "harmonic grace"). The narrative distance remains stable, though some passages veer toward purple prose that obscures rather than clarifies the action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, but overwriting appears in peak beats ("azure-coat," "logically emotional to her marrow," "sonic absolution"). Template cadence emerges in parallel structures ("She adapted... She had protected... she had reminded"). Mixed metaphors blur sense (ice simultaneously groans, sings, sighs, and screams). The phrase "logically emotional" appears three times, creating unnecessary repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of vibrational matching as both navigation method and defensive strategy offers fresh specificity. The transformation of a lighthouse engineer into a frequency mediator provides an non-obvious angle. However, the instant conversion of antagonists through "harmonic grace" relies on a familiar redemption-through-beauty trope without sufficient grounding.</comment>
