<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation through somatic navigation is exceptionally clear, with embodied contradictions (tremors, pulses, twitches) driving concrete choices that lead to reconnection with Mateo. The final choice to open the studio carries visible cost—vulnerability after corporate betrayal—though some interior passages lean toward diagnostic self-awareness ("the recall didn't break connections—it revealed how artificial they'd been").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as somatic markers accumulate into a method for navigation, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration when Elira transforms from isolated sufferer to guide opening her studio. Cost is visible in tears and the risk of sharing fractured methods, though the orientation anchor "three nights prior" creates mild temporal blur that doesn't fully resolve.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The studio setting actively constrains and enables choices—oscilloscope, synth, and cables become tools for somatic mapping that charge the final image of "painting the air with somatic glyphs." Sensory details (ozone, turpentine, indigo LEDs) are POV-filtered and selective, though some passages drift toward abstract description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal navigation to finding Mateo to opening the studio for others, with each somatic marker forcing deeper commitment. The cost of vulnerability is clear in the final decision, though the middle section's exploration lacks a decisive tightening moment that would elevate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between artificial telepathy pills and authentic somatic connection, with the muscovite's fractal layers mirroring neural pathways. The ending's image of "somatic glyphs only fractured minds could read" resonantly reweights earlier exploration, though one passage explicitly states theme ("True communion wasn't chemical. It was somatic").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through technical-artistic fusion (light painting meets neural mapping) with controlled rhythm that accelerates during somatic discovery sequences. Voice maintains consistency through scientific precision meeting embodied experience, though occasional register drift appears ("willowglass hope" repeated as prompt-echo).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with vivid technical-poetic fusion, but template cadence appears in middle sections ("She + verb" patterns) and some paraphrase loops ("It was crude. It was brilliant. It was the only way"). Filter verbs cluster in exploration sequences, though the closing image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The somatic navigation method offers a genuinely fresh angle on telepathy-loss recovery, transforming the pill-recall premise through embodied practice rather than technological solution. Risk-taking in the fractal-somatic synthesis pays off, creating an inevitable-feeling resolution.</comment>
