<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation through comprehension rather than vengeance creates genuine complexity, with contradictory impulses (holding back tears but letting them refract) acting in scene. The final choice to seek Aris with the fruit-compass is earned through prior causality. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("soft and startled") rather than pure embodiment in middle beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where silence transforms from emptiness to resonance/frequency, with visible cost in the separation's new theorem. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for slight causality softness in how the glass eyes project the equation—the lunar angle mechanism feels convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cavern orchard setting constrains choices through bioluminescent fruit responding to presence/absence and stalactite drips as metronomes. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from mosaic to tree to departure. Sensory detail effectively narrows during discovery moments. Doesn't quite reach 8+ because the environment could constrain tactics more actively in middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding loss of shared language) signals early and deepens through the equation discovery that reframes absence. The fruit falling into "waiting hands" shows agency, and Elira's choice to use it as compass rather than consume it demonstrates cost. Missing higher bands because the middle lacks a sharper tightening moment—discovery flows too smoothly without forcing harder trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the transformation of mathematical/emotional language into physical resonance. The final image of the glass eye winking while Aris senses the shift offers a non-literal answer about connection persisting through transformation. The fruit as compass rather than sustenance embodies the theme concretely. Subtext operates effectively in silence and gesture throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent POV. Strong perceptual signature in how Elira notices mathematical patterns in broken things. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("cosmic constants only twins could feel") that strains against the intimate POV. Some filter verb clustering ("feeling the grooves," "sensing the shift") dulls immediacy in key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density high in discovery sequences. However, template cadence appears in emotional beats ("She didn't eat it. She cradled it"), paraphrase loops in the buried optimism explanation, and some purple prose ("stalactite chandeliers"). Minor scaffold in repeated "She [verb]" constructions through middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mathematical grief and bioluminescent botany creates memorable world. The transformation of academic "mathematics of emotion" into lived experience through fruit-light and fractured tile shows genuine originality. The glass eyes as calibration tools for grief measurement is inventive. Slightly derivative in the twin-separation framework but transforms it through specific detail.</comment>
