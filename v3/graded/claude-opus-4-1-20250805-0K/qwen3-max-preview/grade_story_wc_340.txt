<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The servant's interiority is concrete and specific, with embodied emotions like "tears...hovered, crystalline, at the edge of her lashes." Her micro-choices (kneeling, breathing before opening the diary) reveal values under pressure. The "warmly inquisitive" trait manifests through consistent actions rather than labels. Minor deduction for slight emotional smoothness in processing complex grief without more contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the servant internalizes the captain's wisdom about joy within suffering. The cipher discovery at floor five creates causal progression, and the final image of fractured goggles as "a lens of gratitude" reweights the entire ascent with felt cost. Orientation anchors (elevator, ten floors, ascending servant) establish clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire's vertical architecture constrains movement to the elevator's rhythm, making each floor a measured beat. Sensory details like "brass rail...softer than snowfall" and "glacial bronze" bell are selective and purposeful. The goggles' "cracked lenses filtering the world into fractured beauty" becomes the final perceptual shift that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (seeking joy beneath anguish) progresses through the cipher discovery, diary fragment, and final revelation, with each floor marking deepening understanding. The cost is primarily internal transformation rather than external conflict, appropriate for the Accumulative lens. The "fractured view now a lens of gratitude" shows genuine stance crystallization with emotional price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the captain's encrypted wisdom and the servant's embodied discovery process. The final insight "Joy hides not beneath, but within—folded in the creases of every hard-won dawn" reweights the entire search without moralizing. The recurring motif of folding/unfolding ("unfolded the goggles' strap," "Unfold it gently") accumulates meaning that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature with selective attention to "rivets and frost-rimmed seams" and rhythmic polishing. The lyric register maintains consistency while modulating with discovery ("fingers trembled not from cold, but recognition"). No dialogue to evaluate. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("liquid gold," "crystalline") that slightly exceeds the servant's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("She was not merely climbing ten floors—she was ascending through memory"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor metaphor density in places ("wings," "liquid gold," "tiny lanterns") without clear pattern-teaching, and slight register elevation in final third ("proof that life persists").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary-as-emotional-map offers a fresh angle on the grief/wisdom narrative. The specific detail of "latitudes of laughter, longitudes of loss" transforms the navigation metaphor. The fractured goggles becoming a grateful lens is earned and non-obvious. Moderate deduction for familiar core premise of finding mentor's hidden wisdom, though execution adds specificity.</comment>
