<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The weaver's internal contradiction between honoring breakage and mending it drives genuine tension through embodied action (sewing memory into stone, plate warming against chest). Her choice to mend rather than burn/bury the plate shows earned agency with visible cost in the needle-scars and ancestral resistance. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("hauntingly optimistic" relies on label) and occasional therapy-speak ("forgiven regrets").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the sewing sequence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the plate transforms and the canyon walls reveal ghostly tapestries. Cost is visible in the needle-scars and the generational pattern of failed attempts. The closure lands with the weaver's ongoing commitment ("She would return tomorrow") showing Earned Stasis. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay (who/where anchors drift early) and some abstract phrasing around the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting actively constrains movement through "overlapping sleepwalking paths" and ancestral footprints, while the canyon's response (humming walls, buried bell) participates in the ritual. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (dust tasting of hymns, breeze sweet as orchid solace). The setting transforms with the weaver's work, revealing ghostly tapestries that charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of mending vs. abandoning the plate deepens through the sewing sequence, with each stitch explicitly a "counter-spell against erasure." Escalation reads through accumulative pressure as the plate warms, painted eyes blink, and the canyon responds. Cost is legible in the needle-scars and the commitment to return nightly, though the conflict lacks a sharp tightening moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central image of mending fractures into filigree—"not to erase the breakage, but to honor its shape." The final lines offer a resonant answer without moralizing: "even shattered things hold the map to their own becoming." The plate's transformation from broken porcelain to pulsing heart creates layered meaning about repair, memory, and ancestral patterns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric register ("moon-pale intuition," "whale-song echoes") that maintains consistency through pressure. The perceptual signature is selective (focusing on textures, ancestral traces) and biased toward the mystical without losing clarity. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction that stretches POV plausibility ("filigree," "counterclockwise vortex").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with most lines doing multiple jobs, and the prose rhythm varies naturally with scene needs. However, figurative language appears too frequently in peak beats without clear payoff ("drowned constellations," "heart wrapped in velvet" cluster densely). Some template cadence in the "She [verb]" repetitions mid-story, though this partially reads as intentional patterning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of repair-as-resistance with specific mystical realism (sewing memory into stone, plates that pulse like hearts). The image of making "scars part of the story's spine" transforms familiar healing metaphors. The commitment to nightly return until "the canyon remembered how to sing" shows bold dedication to the premise without retreat.</comment>
