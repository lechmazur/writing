I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered metaphors and recursive patterns toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fractal weaver's motivation crystallizes through embodied contradiction—trapped by purpose yet finding meaning in that constraint. The man's grief over his lost daughter provides concrete external pressure. Minor deduction for the weaver's final burden (the locket) arriving late without sufficient setup, though the endurance choice lands with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis—the weaver's acceptance of perpetual duty with visible cost ("Not to be free. But to endure."). The accumulative structure coheres through the calcification metaphor, building density toward the final image. Orientation anchors clearly (bronze grotto, fractal weaver, after snowmelt). Slight dock for the predictable visitor arrival pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bronze grotto functions as more than setting—its oxidized walls hold calcified burdens, constraining and enabling the weaver's work. Sensory details ("copper halos that danced like drowned fireflies") reflect POV perception. The grotto's "magnetic seam" and starlight fissure become functional tools for the ritual, elevating setting beyond description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the accumulation of burden metaphors, from the man's lost daughter to the weaver's own trapped purpose. The tension between helping others and bearing eternal duty creates genuine pressure. The cost is visible in the final image, though the conflict lacks a decisive tightening turn—more resonant accumulation than escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the calcification metaphor—grief transformed but never erased. The paradox of being "boundary-lessly trapped" by purpose resonates without explicit moralizing. The final image of endurance over freedom offers a non-literal answer to suffering. Slight deduction for occasional abstraction ("monument to survival").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice merges lyrical precision ("tessellating lattices that shimmered like frozen breath") with grounded emotion. The perceptual signature—noticing fractals, weights, crystalline patterns—remains consistent. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully between the weaver's work and introspection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong figurative control ("whalebone reverie, soft and hollow and heavy") with varied syntax. Information density high—most sentences carry multiple functions. Deductions for repetitive "calcify" variants (8 instances) creating mild template cadence, and slight overwriting in metaphor density during the ritual sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fractal weaver concept offers fresh mythology—neither healer nor destroyer but crystallizer of grief. The specific ritual mechanics (orienting the lamp, aligning with magnetic seams) avoid generic magic. The burden-as-fossil preservation system feels original. Minor dock for predictable helper-figure structure.</comment>
