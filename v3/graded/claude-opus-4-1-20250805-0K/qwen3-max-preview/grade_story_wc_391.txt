I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through pattern, repetition, and density toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than causal turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mapper's character emerges through concrete choices—kneeling on ice to trace constellations, teaching children to read ice rather than borders, refusing spectacle for stillness. Her internal consistency holds through the pattern of patient resistance, though the piece leans heavily on conceptual work over embodied emotion in places.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through earned stasis—the mapper's patient revolution succeeds not through action but through contagion of presence, with visible cost in the old regime's silence and retreat. The accumulative structure coheres around the moon-tracking motif and magnetic resonance, though the middle third occasionally drifts into abstraction ("rage burns fast and leaves only ash").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake function as more than backdrop—they constrain and enable the revolution's methods (ice for tracking, viaduct for tuning, basalt walls for marking coordinates). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("hoarfrost," "iron bones gleaming," "brass sextant older than the regime"), with the magnetic viaduct's transformation from industrial to lunar harmonics charging the entire piece.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes build through accumulation rather than reversal—from solitary mapping to children arriving, then parents, elders, soldiers, finally the regime's envoys. The cost manifests in the regime's three-stage retreat (confusion, hesitation, withdrawal) and the mapper's sustained patience "under stone," though peak pressure could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete revolution of stillness versus spectacle, with the moon paths and magnetic resonance creating a non-literal answer to power. The piece resists easy morals, showing patience as both method and outcome, though occasionally it states what could be implied ("rage burns fast").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric elevation with controlled rhythm ("not conquest, not noise, not fire") and selective perception focused on lunar/magnetic elements. The perceptual signature is distinct—always attuned to vibration, resonance, and celestial alignment—though some passages drift toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("iron bones gleaming under a sky still bruised with storm memory") but suffers from repetitive structural patterns ("She had learned...She slept...She never claimed"). Information density is high but momentum occasionally stalls in conceptual passages rather than maintaining sensory grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of revolution through stillness and lunar attunement offers genuine freshness—transforming industrial infrastructure into spiritual instrument, conquest into cartography of longing. The synthesis of magnetic science and mystical patience creates something memorable, elevated by risk-taking in choosing quietude over action.</comment>
