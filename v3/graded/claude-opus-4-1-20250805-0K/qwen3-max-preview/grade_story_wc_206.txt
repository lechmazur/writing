<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The repairman's guilt over the lie to the grieving mother creates genuine internal conflict that drives his interaction with the philosopher's stone. His choice to sing rather than mechanically repair shows character-specific problem-solving rooted in emotional truth. The final commitment to "mend with truth, not with tools" represents earned growth from his past failure, though some interior passages lean toward abstract reflection rather than embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the repairman transforms from mechanical fixer to "keeper of unsung melodies," with visible cost in confronting his past lie. The covenant of rust revelation—that truth emerges through wear rather than decay—reweights the entire premise. Causality holds as his guilt directly motivates the singing solution, though the midnight shadows' arrival feels slightly arbitrary despite thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The resonance chamber with copper pipes and glass bells functions as active setting that amplifies his song and enables the transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"amber and gold, swirling from the dancer's motion"—filtered through his craftsman's perception. The chamber's sympathetic vibration directly participates in the climactic restoration, making environment essential to resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light through truth rather than force—escalates from stone wilting to chamber blazing with reclaimed light. The repairman's agency drives the resolution through his choice to sing rather than repair mechanically. The midnight deadline creates temporal pressure, though the shadow threat could be more causally integrated rather than appearing as external complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the covenant of rust metaphor: "truth blooming only when surfaces surrendered to time." The final image of the repairman as "keeper of unsung melodies" offers a non-literal answer to the question of redemption through honest craft. The stone's wilting near dishonesty creates a physical manifestation of the moral dimension without preaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice emerges through craft-specific perception ("fingers moving with the rhythm of forgotten lullabies") and lyrical compression ("to be the keeper of unsung melodies, the mender of silent sorrows"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("truth blooming only when surfaces surrendered to time") that slightly strains the craftsman's lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong moments of lyrical precision ("shadows grew teeth and stolen light pooled under doors like spilled mercury") but several instances of abstract philosophizing dilute momentum ("mending what isn't torn: the invisible fractures in melody"). Template patterns appear in parallel constructions ("not with tools, but with truth, not with force, but with resonance"). The prose achieves beauty but occasionally at the expense of forward drive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The covenant of rust concept freshly reframes oxidation as truth-revealing rather than destructive decay. The music box repairman who repairs through song rather than mechanics offers an original angle on craft and redemption. The philosopher's stone that wilts near dishonesty transforms a familiar magical object, though some metaphysical passages lean toward abstraction rather than grounded specificity.</comment>
