<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's ability to identify walks drives meaningful choices throughout, particularly her tracking of Delgado and decision to pass evidence to Ruiz based on his "measured, deliberate tread." Internal consistency strong with her navigation-by-sound matching her maintenance worker expertise. Minor deduction for some diagnostic clarity in the revelation about whispers/shouts rather than fully embodied realization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern of silent observation building to the final whisper-based justice. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration where Lena proves whispers' power by orchestrating Delgado's quiet downfall, with visible cost in his removal. The coin-as-key revelation that opens ears rather than doors effectively reweights the entire navigation sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The labyrinth of containers functions as both literal maze and acoustic environment that shapes Lena's navigation methods and discovery. Storm's interference with her calibrated hearing creates genuine constraint. Setting actively enables the plot through hidden passages and acoustic properties, though some industrial details remain generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity about the coin to uncovering corruption, with Lena's agency driving the investigation through her unique skill. The whispers-vs-shouts tension crystallizes in her choice to expose Delgado quietly rather than confrontationally. Cost is visible in Delgado's removal, though the personal risk to Lena could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the coin's function and Lena's methodical approach, culminating in proof that "whispers travel farther than shouts." The folded map metaphor layers nicely with folded truths. Final image of whispers echoing in steel canyons resonates without stating the moral explicitly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with industrial specificity ("rust-streaked," "Junction Gamma-7") and consistent focus on sound/movement perception. Free indirect style clean throughout with Lena's sonic expertise coloring observations. Minor register elevation in some descriptive passages ("calibrated silence") but maintains coherence under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong sensory specificity and varied syntax, particularly in sound descriptions. Information density high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some elevated diction ("calibrated ears," "residual warmth") occasionally drifts from Lena's working-class register but doesn't obscure clarity. Clean prose with good momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle on industrial espionage through acoustic navigation and the coin-as-listening-device twist. The integration of port worker culture with zodiac mysticism feels organic. While corruption plots are familiar, the specific method of resolution through calibrated silence and passed evidence shows originality.</comment>
