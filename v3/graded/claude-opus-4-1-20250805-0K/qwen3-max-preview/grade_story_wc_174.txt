<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The calligrapher's motivation is clear and rooted in his moral awakening about "aestheticizing harm," with concrete embodied details like "uncommonly serene fingers" and the visceral puppet shows. His transformation from moral evasion to accountability through subversive art is earned through specific backstory. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("I reverse not to undo, but to reveal") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where serenity is "earned" through accepting conflict rather than avoiding it. The closure lands with visible cost—his acceptance of Mira's potential rejection. Orientation anchors clearly (radar dome, post-argument). Deduction for heavy reflection percentage (~35%) though it's anchored to present objects and alters his stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The radar dome functions as more than setting—its "skeletal ribs" and "abandoned signals" mirror the protagonist's ethical reconstruction. The campfire stick constrains choice as his "compass" for storytelling decisions. Sensory detail is selective ("rain drummed...like Morse code"). Missing higher band because environment could more directly shape final tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical storytelling vs. aesthetic evasion) is clear and deepens through the veteran's violent reaction that becomes "punctuation, not interruption." The final choice to return to Mira with vulnerability rather than flowers shows earned agency. However, most conflict is retrospective; present-scene pressure could be stronger for this band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the puppet shows that "twist" popular myths and the stick's warning about stories burning "twice." The final insight about earning serenity "not by avoiding conflict, but by turning its embers into light" offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext operates well in the puppet performances and Mira's accusation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled diction ("urbane," "meteor hush") and consistent POV. Strong perceptual signature in how he notices the dome's "rivets into eyes, girders into grasping fingers." Some register elevation in peak moments ("aestheticizing harm," "moral evasion") slightly outside natural speech but serves the literary tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple layers. Deductions for occasional abstraction ("moral evasion," "ethical weight") and slight overwriting in metaphorical passages. The "meteor hush" repetition works as pattern but borders on precious.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of calligraphy and puppet shows as vehicles for ethical reckoning is non-obvious. The specific detail of performing in "The Rusty Needle" and "The Unreliable Narrator" adds texture. The transformation of beautiful penmanship into moral accountability through subversive art shows genuine originality, though some workshop elements feel familiar.</comment>
