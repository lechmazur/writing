<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guardian's motivation crystallizes through concrete details (the boy from Bridge Seven, creating light-glyphs for the lost) with embodied contradiction between her silence and active intervention. The drowned woman's interaction shows earned change through specific gesture. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("hope's geometry") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the guardian's work validates through the drowned woman's smile and the single unswallowed star—visible cost in "half-spoken, half-seen, wholly necessary." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern-weaving builds to this crystallized moment. Slight deduction for delayed orientation (canal location emerges gradually).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, iron grates, and dental mirror function as micro-setting that constrains the guardian's methods—she must work through reflections and shutter-angles. Vivid sensory work ("slick planks reflecting bruised clouds"). Some abstract descriptors ("stillwater tension") don't fully ground in physical detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes emerge through the guardian's covenant with "the drowned and the dreaming," deepening when the drowned woman appears and the guardian must prove her method works. Cost is visible in the woman's transformation and the guardian's necessary isolation. Pressure could tighten more dramatically in the middle section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the central image of teaching "darkness the value of stars—not by banishing it, but by showing it what it swallows can still shine." The drowned woman's smile reweights the entire premise without stating a moral. The guardian's work becomes a meditation on witness and transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric compression ("spiralingly calm as the tide's whisper") and consistent perceptual signature focused on light, reflection, and geometry. No dialogue strengthens the piece's commitment to silence as covenant. Rhythm modulates perfectly during the weaving sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("hooded and motionless beneath the rusted awning, spiralingly calm"). Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from embodied action ("hope's geometry," "synopsis's first note"). Excellent varied sentence structure and purposeful paragraph breaks that control pacing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of canal gothic with light-weaving magic grounded in specific tools (dental mirror, iron shutters). The concept of a guardian who helps the drowned through reflected light-patterns feels earned and particular. Slightly familiar mystical guardian archetype prevents higher score.</comment>
