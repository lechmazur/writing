<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal journey from hypothesis-driven skepticism to embodied understanding is well-earned through concrete sensory details and micro-choices. Her decision to leave the amber as "coordinate" rather than offering shows meaningful character evolution with visible cost—abandoning her need for quantifiable data.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the protagonist's realization that "truth was emergent—born where paths crossed." The cost is legible in her abandonment of peer review and quantifiable certainty. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently, with density increasing toward the tower summit and a clear cadence shift at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower, dusty footprints, and fly amber create a lived-in world that constrains choices—the protagonist must physically ascend, follow worn paths, and confront the amber's metaphorical weight. The "bronze quiet" atmosphere effectively charges the final image, though some descriptive passages lean toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding homecoming's chemistry—deepens from external measurement to internal transformation. The protagonist's agency drives the escalation through her choice to sit, wait, and ultimately abandon her scientific framework, with the cost visible in leaving behind her hypothesis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The amber's evolution from "control sample" to "companion" to "coordinate" brilliantly reweights the central question without stating a moral. The theme of convergence versus isolation emerges through concrete particulars—footprints, concentric rings, the spectrometer's failure—creating genuine resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains a distinctive academic-poetic register that modulates effectively with the protagonist's internal shift. Perceptual signature is strong—she notices "equations only the wind could solve" and experiences the tower through scientific metaphor that gradually yields to embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good information density, though occasional overwriting appears ("bronze quiet sentinel," multiple compound descriptors). Some repetitive phrasing around "convergence" and "footprints" creates minor loops. The closing sequence achieves strong propulsion despite these issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of scientific pilgrimage—using spectrometers to measure spiritual homecoming—offers a fresh synthesis. The transformation of the fly amber from specimen to coordinate shows genuine ingenuity, though the resolution trends slightly toward expected territory for this type of spiritual journey narrative.</comment>
