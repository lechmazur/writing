<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locksmith's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving wonder through geometric relationships—but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. His methodical work shows embodied focus through physical details like "fingertips brushing dust," yet emotional complexity remains largely cerebral rather than conflicted. The final renunciation (leaving without looking back) carries visible cost through the abandoned village contrast, though internal struggle could deepen.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the "larder for the soul" that future travelers discover, with visible cost in the abandoned village above. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern-teaching (light angles, emotional temperature classifications). Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 with character, setting, and timeframe. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and pays it off, though the conceptual cost could be more sharply felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The marble cavern actively constrains choices through its single shaft of light at specific times (11:03, 3:17), making the setting essential to the locksmith's method. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"quartz veins," "condensation," "crystal shards that glittered like frozen tears"—filtered through his specialized perception. The cavern-as-instrument concept elevates beyond mere backdrop, with stalactites cracking from resonance demonstrating environmental participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder for "when the world grew too loud"—signals early and deepens through accumulation of discoveries (glyphs, pulses, shattered stalactites). Agency manifests through deliberate methodology rather than external conflict, with the locksmith's patience and peripheral vision approach foreclosing direct observation. Cost appears in the abandoned village context and his solitary work, though pressure could tighten more decisively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of storing wonder "in the cellar of reason," avoiding explicit moralizing. The peripheral vision methodology embodies the theme that truth requires oblique approaches—"to see truth, he had to glance sideways." The ending's anonymous offerings show resonance without explanation, though the "nutrient not luxury" line edges toward thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through specialized vocabulary ("foxed leather," "geological patience") and syntax that mirrors the locksmith's indirect perception—long, accumulative sentences with nested observations. The perceptual signature is strong: focusing on "edges, the glimmers between shadows." No head-hopping occurs, and the consistent third-person limited maintains appropriate distance for this contemplative tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"frost clung like regret" establishes both setting and emotional register. Rhythm varies purposefully between longer accumulative passages and shorter declaratives like "He didn't flinch." Some figurative density in places ("mercury—elusive, toxic if grasped too directly") but serves the oblique-perception theme. Minor repetition of "echo" concept but functions as pattern rather than loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reverse-engineering wonder concept offers a fresh angle on preservation—storing emotional resonance in geometric relationships rather than conventional archives. The peripheral vision methodology and "emotional temperature" classification system show specific invention. The piece commits fully to its premise of physics-as-poetry without retreat, though the abandoned village frame is somewhat familiar.</comment>
