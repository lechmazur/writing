<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's patient calibration philosophy drives every choice, from refusing false alarms to designing atmospheric triggers that translate "whispers into mechanical pull." Her internal stance—favoring listening over noise—generates concrete actions with visible cost (seventeen years since the last false alarm). The final choice to let natural forces activate the bell rather than force it shows earned wisdom, though some interior passages lean toward abstraction ("patience was the first instrument of truth").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through sensor details, calibration metrics, and the bell's eventual organic activation. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as trust replaces fear in the village's response, with visible cost in the seventeen-year silence and the protagonist's humble, unrecognized work. Minor orientation friction with "after the glue dries" as temporal anchor feels more metaphorical than concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sanctuary's physical details—spiral stairs exhaling stone dust, bell rope "like a dormant serpent," stained-glass eyes—constrain and enable the protagonist's technical work. The mountain's "iron heart" and atmospheric conditions become active participants in the story's resolution. Setting drives the closure when environmental triggers activate the bell system.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on restoring trust after the "Great False Dawn" panic, with escalation through precise calibration requirements (3.2 knots, 7 degrees, 43 seconds). The protagonist's patient testing against premature activation creates tension, though the conflict remains primarily philosophical rather than urgent. Cost is legible in the seventeen-year burden and the risk of another false alarm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between sirens that "screamed" and bells that offer "blessing," crystallizing in "the space between silence and sound, between fear and faith." The recurring motif of patience and listening accumulates meaning, though occasionally tips into explicit statement ("She had not invented safety. She had restored trust.").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines technical precision ("barometric levers, thermal threads, electrostatic lures") with lyrical observation ("prayer caught mid-breath"). The prose rhythm modulates effectively between meditative passages and technical specifics. Perceptual signature strong in how the protagonist reads atmospheric signs as language.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Her boots, laced with care but worn thin at the soles, whispered against the risers as if apologizing" establishes character, setting, and tone simultaneously. Some figurative density in places ("needle stitching heaven to earth") but generally supports the contemplative tone. Clean prose with varied syntax and purposeful repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh angle on disaster warning through patient calibration over alarmism, though the core premise of replacing technological sirens with natural triggers feels somewhat familiar. Specific technical details (microclimate sensors, calibrated counterweights) and the philosophical stance toward listening elevate execution.</comment>
