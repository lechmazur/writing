<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to prove time moves sideways drives concrete action through the lever pull, with her "mechanically warm" demeanor creating subtle tension against the cold environment. The adjacent-self encounter shows contradictory impulses acting in scene ("Don't let go" versus her own terror), and the final choice to adjust the lever by 2.7 degrees demonstrates micro-choice under pressure with visible consequence—the other self vanishing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Elira's discovery that "time doesn't flow here—it folded" fundamentally reweights the station's purpose and the xenomorphs' behavior. The lever pull creates a decisive turn that reveals lateral time, with cost visible in the terror of the adjacent self and the lingering "scent of ozone and cinnamon" marking permanent change. Who/where/when anchored within first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus functions as micro-setting that constrains Elira's choice (she must pull the ancient lever to test her theory), with sensory detail like "air thick with the hush of beating wings" and "bruised violet and silver" sky creating atmosphere. The station's "titanium ribs groaning" and specific details like "comet-iron" lever ground the fantastical premise, though some occupational detail remains generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—escalates from theoretical obsession to embodied encounter when Elira sees her adjacent self, forcing immediate tactical adjustment (the 2.7-degree recalibration). Cost is legible in the other self's terror and warning, though the resolution comes perhaps too easily without lasting consequence beyond the lingering scent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of lateral possibility emerges through the concrete discovery that parallel presents exist "like feathers against glass," with the final image of xenomorphs "roosting not in space, but in the fold between moments" offering a non-literal answer to the central question. The "Subdued Awakenings" log entry and steam "curling...like a question mark" resist tidy resolution while maintaining thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent scientific register with poetic inflection ("twilight's magnetic hush," "accordion-style"), though some phrases edge toward purple prose. POV control is stable with selective perception (Elira notices magnetic field trembling "as if sensing her intent"), and the final shift to observing xenomorphs "unaware" extends focalization naturally.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythmic variation and purposeful paragraph structure, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("bruised violet and silver," "ice and velvet") and repetitive constructions ("She'd spent...She called it"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple elements, though some figurative language feels forced ("accordion-style" time folding). Minor template cadence in "She [verb]" patterns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of time moving laterally through magnetic fields offers a fresh angle on parallel universe tropes, with specific execution through the "holographic principles" discovery and the adjacent-self encounter. The integration of roosting xenomorphs as unconscious inhabitants of temporal folds shows originality, though the resolution feels somewhat convenient.</comment>
