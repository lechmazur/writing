<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's grief-driven solitude and ritual tenderness create genuine internal contradiction, particularly in how he protects connection while maintaining isolation. The moment with the sea glass as "bottled feeling of safety" embodies complex emotion effectively. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "hollowing, a draft where safety used to sit" which edges toward label-speak rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Elias's act of tending transforms his grief from "sharp" to "luminescent," a genuine reconfiguration with emotional cost. The pattern of ritual acts (delivering letters, placing stones, carrying glass) accumulates toward this shift. Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the transformation and the lamp's convenient re-lighting which, while symbolically apt, lacks clear causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting effectively constrains and enables key choices - the spiral stairs create isolation, the lantern room's "ghost-light" triggers the crisis, and the cairn tradition provides the resolution mechanism. Sea glass and stones function as micro-settings that shape action. Slight deduction for occasional generic maritime atmosphere ("salt and spray," "ragged coast") that could be more particular.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake - transforming grief into connection - deepens through the lamp's extinction creating genuine crisis that forces Elias to enact rather than merely deliver care. The cost is visible in his vulnerability with the sea glass and stone message. However, the lamp's mysterious re-lighting undercuts agency slightly, and the resolution feels somewhat predetermined rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through concrete acts: anonymous letters as "fragile chain," cairns as wordless communication, the sea glass as grief transformed. The final image of Elias humming "for anyone—or no one" resonantly answers the isolation/connection question without moralizing. Minor deduction for the slightly over-explicit "to say, without sound, 'You are not alone.'"</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in how Elias notices maritime details and interprets silence ("gulls that trailed his skiff like feathered tax collectors"). The voice maintains consistent restraint matching character, with effective modulation during the lamp crisis. The free indirect style works cleanly throughout. Slight deduction for occasional register elevation ("luminescent, glowing softly") that strains against the skipper's lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("bruised twilight sky," "cobalt blue, worn soft by tides"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. However, several instances of elevated diction ("spectral glow," "velvet dark," "luminescent") create mild register drift, and there's light redundancy in explaining the letter chain system.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse keeper traditions with anonymous letter delivery creates fresh emotional territory. The specific use of cairns as coded messages and the sea glass as transformed grief show genuine invention. However, the haunted lighthouse and grieving widower are familiar tropes not fully transformed, keeping this from higher bands.</comment>
