<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's transformation from glass artist to healer emerges through concrete actions (studying frost patterns, fusing old glass with canyon sand) rather than declaration. Her internal shift from seeking "triumph" to understanding survival as "subtraction" drives meaningful choices. Minor deduction for slightly abstract moments ("Purpose, she realized, wasn't a destination") that lean toward articulated wisdom rather than purely embodied realization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with frost patterns building toward the revelation that the ledger recorded escapes, not commerce—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights all prior material. The cost is visible in her transformation from artist to gift-giver, forsaking commerce for healing. Orientation anchors (canyon, post-fire, glass artist) establish clearly within the first paragraphs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canyon functions as active constraint and enabler—its silence teaches patience, its frost provides artistic patterns, its isolation enables healing. Sensory details ("cold stone," "grit of ash," "spectral alphabets") are selective and purposeful. The micro-setting of frost patterns directly shapes her artistic choices and ultimate revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding purpose after catastrophic loss—deepens through the frost-ledger synchrony that reveals the smugglers' mercy. This discovery forecloses her path as commercial artist, visible in her choice to gift rather than sell. The escalation is textural rather than causal, appropriate to the lens, with cost manifest in her acceptance of isolation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of destruction/creation, commerce/gift, noise/silence without explicit moralizing. The ledger's transformation from "traded lives for profit" to a map of mercy resonates without stating a lesson. The final image of glass "born of scorched testament and quiet retracing" synthesizes all thematic threads through concrete objects.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("the canyon floor held her like a secret the earth refused to surrender"). Fragment sentences and parallel structures ("Not coincidence. Synchrony.") create rhythmic emphasis at key moments. The perceptual signature—attention to patterns, textures, transformations—remains consistent with the artist-protagonist's sensibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("spirals mimicking galaxy arms, branching veins echoing capillaries"). Some repetitive structures in the middle section ("She [verb]. She [verb].") and occasional abstraction ("drifting resonance") that could be more concrete. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of glass artistry with survival narrative through frost patterns offers a fresh angle on post-trauma healing. The ledger's revelation as escape map rather than commerce record provides genuine surprise that feels earned. Some familiar beats (artist finds meaning through creation) prevent higher scoring, though the specific execution elevates beyond template.</comment>
