<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "modify" rather than mourn is clear and consistent, with internal conflict between past sterility and newfound emotional excavation visible throughout. The choice to integrate the child's memory with her own demonstrates agency under pressure with visible emotional cost ("legs stiff from kneeling," "eyes wet but unblinking"). However, the transformation feels somewhat abstract—the specific trade-offs of her synaptic modifications lack concrete dramatization beyond metaphorical description.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the engineer's final stance crystallizes as she commits to ongoing modification work with "eyes wet but unblinking." The cost is felt through physical details and emotional embodiment, though the exact nature of the synaptic plasticity remains abstract. Orientation anchors clearly (canyon, moon, engineer) and the pattern of memory-modification builds density toward the ending image of stepping "into the next bend."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon setting actively shapes the protagonist's archaeological work—"each ridge a dendrite, each crevasse a forgotten impulse"—with the environment functioning as both physical and neural terrain. Sensory details layer effectively ("wind combed through juniper like fingers through hair," "boots scuffing stone"). The mirror-as-micro-setting constrains choice when she must decide whether to pocket it and continue her work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming grief into curiosity through neural modification—is signaled early and deepens when the child's memory floods the protagonist, forcing her to confront her own "lab where equations replaced empathy." The escalation from finding the mirror to absorbing memories to committing to ongoing excavation work shows progression, though the conflict remains largely internal without external resistance or clear trade-offs beyond emotional cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of modification versus mourning emerges organically through the mirror's transformation from "relic of loss" to "palimpsest of longing, recalibrated." The mentor's wisdom about "precision without chaos" pays off when the protagonist embraces her "chaotically precise" mind to navigate memory fractures. The final image of stepping toward "sage and second chances" offers a non-literal answer about transformation without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent lyric-technical register befitting a "helix-minded engineer" with phrases like "synaptic terrain" and "neural cartography." Perceptual signature is strong—she sees the canyon as neural architecture and memories as entangled quantum states. Some passages drift toward purple prose ("cathedral of her mind," "liquid mercury") but generally serve the quaking reverie tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences carrying both literal and metaphorical weight, though some passages loop conceptually ("She did not weep for the dreams; she modified them" followed by extended restatement). Template cadence appears in the "She had come..." / "She did not..." / "She modified..." sequence. The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("owls called in binary hoots") but occasionally strains metaphors beyond clarity ("helix-minded" never quite lands).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of synaptic plasticity as a method for emotional archaeology offers a fresh angle on grief processing, moving beyond typical memory narratives. The synthesis of neuroscience terminology with emotional excavation creates originality, though the execution sometimes favors abstract beauty over concrete specificity. The risk of making memory modification literal rather than metaphorical pays off partially.</comment>
