I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern recognition, musical metaphors, and a final resonant performance that reweights understanding.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and compelling - restoring trust through linguistic resurrection. Internal conflict between bold gambling and meticulous cross-referencing creates authentic tension. The final choice to conduct the symphony carries visible risk and cost. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("cautious exuberance") rather than fully embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the symphonic performance transforms understanding with visible cost (tears, trembling, years to rebuild). The accumulative lens holds consistently through musical pattern discovery to choral resolution. Orientation anchored early (archive, linguist, Syrathi). Deduction for slight conceptual abstractness in the "semantic dissonance" explanation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The archive setting actively constrains and enables choices - its acoustics calibrate the restoration, the rotunda's echoes matter for the performance. Sensory details (dust-laden air, ink-stained cuffs) are selective and purposeful. The glass ink well's resonance with restored frequencies elevates the setting-as-instrument. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("gaunt man").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal mission to civilizational restoration with clear cost (breaking promises shatters truth again). The pressure tightens through discovery of why the Syrathi ceased writing, building to the high-stakes performance. Agency drives the resolution through the protagonist's choice to conduct despite warnings.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the concrete discovery that truth must be performed, not declared. The concept of interconnected promises where "break one promise in the chain, and the entire passage collapsed into noise" creates resonant meaning about trust and community. The final image of prismatic light as "scattered promises kept" offers a non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct voice with academic precision balanced against wonder ("symphonies of truth"). Some excellent moments ("dust fell like snow from the rafters"). Deductions for occasional register elevation that doesn't quite fit the POV ("semantic dissonance," "reknitting the social fabric") and some filter-verb clustering in discovery passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments of rhythmic control during the performance sequence. Information density is good with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for template cadence in places ("She began. The first phrase...The glass ink well..."), some synonym loops around "truth/trust," and occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistics and music as literal rather than metaphorical creates genuine originality. The concept that civilizations can collapse through "semantic dissonance" rather than violence is inventive. The specific integration of musical notation in legal parchments shows creative world-building that serves the theme.</comment>
