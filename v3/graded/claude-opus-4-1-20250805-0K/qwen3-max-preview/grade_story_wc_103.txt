<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to discover time's texture is embodied through concrete sensory details and contradictory impulses (scientific curiosity vs. emotional need). The final realization about grief's coarseness and joy's porosity emerges from dramatized experience, not assertion. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "retrocognitive trap" that briefly lapses into concept-speak rather than maintaining embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elira discovers time's texture through sacrifice (photographs disintegrating). The halo fragment as "wound" reframes the entire garden project with visible cost. Slight deduction for the middle section's density that momentarily obscures the causal chain between fragment contact and photograph dissolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The living bridge garden functions as both setting and instrument, with hyperbolic geometry constraining choices (aging under archways, shedding memories). The halo fragment's prismatic shadows and the garden's symbiotic feeding create atmosphere while advancing plot. Strong integration of sensory details that reflect Elira's professional perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering time's texture) escalates through the photographs' disintegration, forcing Elira to accept the garden's parasitic nature. The cost is legible when she loses her memory anchors but gains direct sensory access to time. One meaningful deepening occurs when the halo reveals itself as a wound rather than tool.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that time has texture—grief is "coarse," joy "porous," anticipation a "lattice of needles and velvet." The final image of Elira touching duration itself offers a non-literal answer about the cost of knowledge. The garden-as-thread metaphor effectively reweights memory's relationship to time.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent POV. Strong perceptual signature in how Elira notices botanical and temporal details through her professional lens. Some elevated diction ("retrocognitively trapped," "hyperbolic geometry") fits the character but occasionally drifts toward abstraction in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("leaves that pulsed like veins," "sky bruised violet"). Some density issues with stacked metaphors in the middle section and occasional abstract phrasing ("temporal pressure zones"). The final paragraph's clarity about time's texture elevates the score despite earlier figurative congestion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical craft with temporal manipulation through hyperbolic geometry. The concept of a garden feeding on memories to grow while granting sensory access to time's grain is original. The specific textures assigned to emotions (grief as coarse, regret as slick layers) avoid generic abstraction.</comment>
