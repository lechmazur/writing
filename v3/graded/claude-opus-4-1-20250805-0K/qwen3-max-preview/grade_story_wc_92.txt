Looking at this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, I'll evaluate each category for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied tension in physical details like "fingers tracing the grooves" and the "clinking" quill holder. Internal conflict between patience and urgency drives meaningful micro-choices. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("calmly inventive" reads more as label than embodied trait).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure—the geometry is planted and will spark change through distributed understanding. The final image of the baker/scribe/stablehand unfolding their copy delivers Charged Poise with legible cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sundial's coded angles function as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is precise ("spiral stair," "courtyard," "armory's back door"). The blackout creates environmental pressure that enables the covert action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sparking revolution through geometry) is clear early and tightens through the blackout opportunity. The protagonist's agency drives escalation via calculated risk-taking with the sundial alignment. Cost is legible in the phrase "cradle of sparks, gently rocked" suggesting fragility of success.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast of silence/revolution and geometry/rebellion. The final image of distributed understanding offers a non-literal answer to how change begins. Subtext operates effectively through "angles" as both literal and metaphorical resistance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with selective attention to shadow, angle, and light. Some register elevation ("luminous fort," "arcane lanterns") slightly strains the voice. Clean POV control throughout with intentional distance shifts that serve the conspiratorial tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in places ("winking hush," "cradle of sparks") without becoming overwrought. Minor template cadence in middle section ("She knelt... She pressed... She folded...") deducts from otherwise strong propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The geometric cipher as revolutionary tool is fresh and specific. The synthesis of mathematics, dissent, and patience creates a non-obvious angle on rebellion narratives. Risk-taking in the quiet, cerebral approach to uprising heightens rather than diminishes stakes.</comment>
