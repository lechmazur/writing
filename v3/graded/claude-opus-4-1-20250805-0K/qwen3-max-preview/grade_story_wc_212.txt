<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from trembling inheritance-bearer to someone vibrating at "the frequency where rage and peace fuse" shows genuine internal contradiction acting in scene. The final choice to decrease entropy through "memory, reverence, and the unbearable lightness of letting go" is earned through concrete action (pressing acorn cap, naming seeds) with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("vortex inheritance humming in her marrow") that lacks full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through the atrium's transformation from frozen to blooming, with Elara's laughter "rooting" into earth as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost is legible in "droplets rose upward...each holding a flicker of color, a scent, a half-remembered song" - lost moments returning differently. Slight deduction for the abstract "vortex inheritance" concept that never fully clarifies its mechanics on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The icebound atrium functions as both setting and constraint, with frozen vines "glittered like shattered chandeliers" transforming to "uncurled...flowers opened like fists relaxing." The acorn cap pressing into marble's spiral creates causal change. Environment actively shapes the resolution through ice that "weeps" upward, defying physics to enable renewal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative deepening: from discovering the hollow egg, to walking barefoot creating "seams of release," to the acorn cap sinking into marble, culminating in the atrium's transformation. The cost is felt in "each name was a stitch in time's unraveling seam." One point off because the "vortex inheritance" stake could be more concretely defined earlier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the paradox of decreasing entropy with tenderness rather than force - "honoring what was lost enough to let it return differently." The final image of Elara's laughter rooting into earth while holding "a door open" offers a resonant, non-literal answer about time and renewal without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("time stuttered," "furiously tranquil," "wild serenity") and strong perceptual signature filtering the fantastic through botanical specificity. Some elevated diction ("vortex inheritance," "entropy") occasionally drifts from character lexicon but rhythm control under pressure is exemplary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with lines doing multiple jobs ("ice began to weep. Not melt—weep"). Strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition ("not calm, not frantic"). Deduction for occasional overwriting in figurative density ("hollows behind the eyes," "marrow") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("texture of borrowed time").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of seed-saving with temporal manipulation through emotional physics ("entropy decreased not by force, but by consent") is non-obvious and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode and the paradoxical solution elevates stakes. Minor deduction for relying on somewhat familiar eco-fantasy elements.</comment>
