<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "transpose life into a new key" drives consistent micro-choices through fortune-writing and lighthouse-tending, with contradictory impulses between isolation and connection playing out in scene. The analyst's arrival and subsequent hiring creates a meaningful change that alters the island's dynamics with visible cost (Elias accepting collaboration). Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("fog thicker than regret") that occasionally replaces embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with pattern-taught fortune-cookie prophecies building density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts the analyst as partner, crystallizing his role as "conductor." The cost is legible in Elias's shift from solitary oracle to collaborative architect. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, island, Elias's role) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse and island function as active constraints—salt-crusted windows, groaning stairs, and tide patterns shape Elias's daily rhythms and fortune-timing. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("kelp whispering," "diesel generator's cough"). The lighthouse beam "slicing dark like a conductor's baton" charges the final orchestration metaphor effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of transforming lives through fortunes escalates from individual impacts (fisherman, widow, teenager) to systemic recognition when the analyst arrives with documented patterns. The tension tightens when Elias must choose between maintaining mystery or accepting partnership, with visible cost in relinquishing sole authorship. One meaningful deepening through accumulated evidence of impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of "orchestration without force" emerges organically through accumulated fortune impacts and the lighthouse-as-conductor metaphor. The final image of multiple typewriters producing fortunes "indifferent to authorship" offers a non-literal answer about influence versus control. Strong subtext in the fortunes themselves as open secrets requiring recognition rather than revelation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("fog thicker than regret," "accidentally prophetic"). The lyric-accumulative mode maintains coherence through patterned fortune-drops and their effects. Minor dialogue between Elias and analyst carries subtext effectively ("You're not predicting. You're conducting."). Slight deduction for occasional register elevation that drifts from Elias's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in fortune sequences. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some metaphorical density in places ("fog thicker than regret," "emotional coastlines") without becoming overwrought. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction and one instance of template phrasing in the fortune-effect sequences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper and fortune cookie writer creates non-obvious angle on fate/influence themes. The microdot specs as tool for compression of meaning adds unexpected texture. Transformation of lighthouse-as-safety to lighthouse-as-conductor shows conceptual follow-through. The piece commits to its accumulative structure without retreating to conventional plot mechanics.</comment>
