<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The astronomer's motivation is clear and consistent—his "encrypted devotion" to cosmic order drives every choice, from selling his cloak for lamp oil to his methodical recording of the tile's resonance. His characterization achieves contradictory depth through the "empirically ironic" tension between rational methodology and mystical pursuit. The final choice to preserve the tile "for the next frugal soul" demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost (his poverty, isolation). Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("weight of knowing") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the tile's activation reveals "a frequency buried in spacetime" that transforms understanding while the astronomer continues his vigil. Cost is visible throughout (poverty, isolation, "page 3,412" showing years of dedication). The piece anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words. Slight deduction because the transformation's precise stakes could be clearer—what exactly changes beyond confirming the resonance?</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ziggurat setting brilliantly functions as both physical constraint (crumbling stairs, "bureaucratic neglect") and thematic mirror for the astronomer's work between empires. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"chalk dust on obsidian," the tile's "low resonant" hum. The palace "reimagined not by kings but by cosmic indifference" directly shapes the astronomer's isolation and dedication. Environment constrains choice throughout, from the Sky Chamber's location to Sirius's positioning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—communion with cosmic order through the tile—is clear from the opening. Escalation builds through accumulation: preparation, alignment, drawing schematics, then the tile's activation at Sirius's descent. Agency is evident in his methodical approach and final choice to preserve rather than exploit. However, the conflict lacks a meaningful tightening that forecloses options—the tile activates as hoped without complication or reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central irony of rational pursuit of the mystical—"magic was merely physics undiscovered." The recurring motif of measurement ("counted every grain thrice," "page 3,412") accumulates to reveal devotion's true nature. The final image of the universe "that noticed everything—even devotion encrypted in arithmetic" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Strong integration of frugality as both practical constraint and spiritual discipline.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevated diction appropriate to the astronomer's scholarly perspective—"empirically ironic perfection," "harmonic lattices." No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature is strong: he notices mathematical patterns, orbital mechanics, precise measurements. Psychic distance modulates effectively from external observation to intimate reflection. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the POV's established range ("ferocious faith").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied syntax and effective rhythm, particularly in accumulative passages. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. However, several instances of overwriting diminish momentum: "dusky harmony" appears twice, some metaphors strain ("time slowed like syrup under moonlight"), and there's occasional template cadence in the middle section ("He had sold...eaten...traded"). The filter-verb stack in paragraph 11 ("thought," "knowing") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of an astronomer seeking cosmic communion through mathematical magic between fallen empires offers genuine freshness. The specific synthesis of Babylonian setting with precise scientific methodology creates originality. The "empirically ironic" paradox drives authentic complexity. However, the resolution follows expected paths without surprising transformation—the tile works as hoped, suggesting some derivative elements in the magical artifact's function.</comment>
