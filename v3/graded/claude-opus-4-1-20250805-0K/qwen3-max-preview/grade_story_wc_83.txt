<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's trauma-driven motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete internal conflict between seeking meaning and confronting loss. The geode functions as a physical anchor for her grief while her "calibrated desperation" shows authentic psychological complexity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "unused potential" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through technical language and emotional weight converging at the departure. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she commits to the hunt with visible cost ("For Marta. For Elias. For Mom."). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Deduction for the concept of "unused potential pools" remaining somewhat abstract despite the coordinates providing specificity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains her actions through zero-gravity movement and technical limitations (circuit breaker cooling). The geode's physical properties ("not warm, not cold, but present") and the South Pacific coordinates provide specific anchors. The irradiated wedding site below creates spatial resonance. Minor deduction for some technical details that don't fully constrain choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on cartographic proof that "potential doesn't die" with one meaningful deepening when coordinates emerge from the perturbation. The protagonist's agency drives the search while the geode provides the means. Cost is visible in her isolation and the names she whispers. Lacks a sharp reversal but the accumulative pressure coheres toward departure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the hunt for "unused potential" in empty places, avoiding direct moralizing. The geode's paradoxical nature ("intangibly tangible") embodies the theme of salvaging meaning from destruction. Final image of "pooling in the hollows between seconds" resonates without stating a moral. Some abstract phrasing prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with technical precision ("perturbation theory," "probability manifold") balanced against emotional specificity ("brittle, broken" smile). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Some register elevation in phrases like "calibrated desperation" and "cartography" feels slightly performative for the emotional state.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong images ("wound turning in its sleep"). Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("unused potential pools"), some filter verbs ("She felt exhilarated"), and slight overwriting in metaphorical density that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone strike trauma with orbital physics creates non-obvious angle. The geode as blast-created artifact carrying "mathematical echoes" is original. Risk-taking in the abstract concept pays off through specific grounding. Minor deduction for the "unused potential" concept remaining somewhat nebulous despite strong execution.</comment>
