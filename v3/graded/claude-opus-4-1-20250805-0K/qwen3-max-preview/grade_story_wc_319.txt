<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guardian's transformation from hollow waiting to patient emissary shows genuine character evolution through embodied details like "throat too thick for speech" and the shift from growling to offering its paw. The dimensional homesickness transmuting from "wound" to "compass" provides earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in middle sections that momentarily weakens the embodied quality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through interiorized landscapes building to the statue awakening and final transformation. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the guardian's shift from exile to emissary with "uncertainty like a lantern" showing clear cost and reconfigured meaning. The pendant's transfer creating connection rather than power provides the decisive gesture. Slight dock for occasional opacity in the middle third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen garden effectively constrains action through ice-statue librarians and mist that "coiled around its ankles like reluctant serpents." Setting details like "frost-laced boughs" and statues with "expressions caught between curiosity and terror" create atmosphere while advancing the guardian's isolation. The garden's final exhalation and mist curling "into something almost like a smile" charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of connection versus isolation deepens through the guardian's swallowing of landscapes, recognition of the cultist's loneliness, and ultimate choice to place the pendant in the statue's hand. This single meaningful turn from solitary vigil to creating connection shows clear cost in accepting uncertainty. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks multiple reversals typical of higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the transformation of "boundaries of light" from walls to membranes to invitations, avoiding direct statement. The cultist's pendant embodying loneliness rather than power subverts expectation meaningfully. The final image of friendship forged "in the quiet between certainties" offers resonant answer to the central question of connection across dimensional exile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice creates "foggy lucidity" through phrases like "glyphs that tasted like static and snow" and "swallowed deserts where dunes whispered secrets." The perceptual signature remains consistent with the feral guardian's otherworldly perspective. Prose modulates effectively from dense imagery to simple clarity in "It offered its paw," heightening the emotional turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "shelves that stretched into forever" and effective rhythm variation. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("foggy lucidity of the in-between," "interiorized exteriors") and occasional opacity reduce momentum. Some repetitive structures in the middle section ("It had swallowed... swallowed... swallowed") work as pattern but slightly diminish variety.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exceptional synthesis of feral creature as librarian-guardian creates fresh angle on isolation and connection. The concept of "interiorizing exteriors" as preservation method and the pendant as crystallized loneliness show genuine originality. The transformation of dimensional homesickness into a compass demonstrates risk-taking that heightens meaning. The specific world-building around library guardians with "ink-stained teeth" elevates beyond template fantasy.</comment>
