I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradictions throughout, particularly Elira's "fiercely gentle" stance manifesting through concrete actions like pressing palms to bark while humming lullabies. The confrontation with Kael creates genuine tension between competing philosophies with visible stakes. Minor deduction for Kael's somewhat stock antagonist role, though his final seedling transformation earns partial recovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kael's grip loosening becomes "Not surrender—seedling" with roots weaving destinies together. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks (cards surfacing, orchard responding) that reweight meaning. Cost is visible in both characters' stances shifting. Orientation anchors establish setting immediately though "three nights prior" creates minor temporal wobble.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard functions as active participant, with roots threading through bones constraining movement and later restraining Kael. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elira's priorities—feeling "damp earth and brittle bone" through bare feet, trusting ambient glow over lanterns. The setting literally shapes the climactic choice when roots surge to intervene, charging the final image of patient weaving.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of how to honor the dead escalates from Elira's solitary ritual through Kael's challenge to the orchard's intervention, forcing both to reconsider their methods. The reversal when roots restrain Kael meaningfully narrows options. Cost manifests in Kael's forced stillness and Elira's acknowledgment that they "patch holes" rather than fix souls—both accepting limitations.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the burned Hanged Man's "inverted grace" echoing both characters' suspended positions between vengeance and grace. The final weaving of destinies offers non-literal answer to whether meaning can be "inlaid in dirt." Subtext operates beautifully in Elira touching Kael's wrist "not to soothe, but to anchor"—gesture carrying full thematic weight without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature with Elira experiencing through touch ("soles pressing," "hands cradled") while Kael appears in visual/auditory terms ("hissed," "half-lit face"). Dialogue carries authentic subtext—"You chain your grief in iron. I let mine grow wings" pursues goals through metaphor. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("trammel") that slightly strains the intimate register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths creating breath between dense imagery. Information density high—"oak whose roots coiled around a child's pelvis" does triple work establishing setting, stakes, and tone. Some figurative density in opening paragraph ("lovers reconciling after war") though it establishes pattern. Clean prose overall with purposeful fragments like "Not surrender—seedling."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of necromancy and gardening creates non-obvious angle on death/memory themes. The specific detail of "moss tucked into eye sockets" and "tarot fragments tucked into hollows where marrow once pooled" transforms potential Gothic cliché. Risk-taking in the quiet resolution that refuses traditional confrontation for mutual recognition earns +0.3 within band.</comment>
