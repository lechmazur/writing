I'll evaluate this story systematically according to the demanding literary publication standards.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's internal journey from ego death to emotional reconnection is well-motivated, with concrete embodiment of his numbness and its dissolution. The duplicate brain's awakening as an autonomous entity rather than Kael's shadow demonstrates earned character evolution. Minor deduction for some abstract philosophical passages that lean toward tell over embodied show, particularly in the middle sections.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the brain's vivification and autonomous emergence, with visible cost in Kael's surrender of ownership. The accumulative/textural lens holds as pressure builds through layered temporal and metaphysical elements toward the final transformation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early and the floating dojo setting remains spatially coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo above ink-black clouds creates a distinctive otherworldly setting that constrains the custody battle to this liminal space. Sensory details like "moss-slick stones humming with residual energy" and "temporal winds" support the metaphysical concept. The setting actively shapes the conflict through its isolation and the judges' levitating perches, though some descriptions remain abstract rather than fully tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central stake—vivifying the brain to defeat emotional numbness—faces escalating pressure through the custody battle's temporal fractures and the judges' accusations. The resolution emerges from Kael's choice to grant autonomy rather than claim ownership, with clear cost in relinquishing control. The complementary opposites mechanism (joy/grief, guilt/absolution) provides concrete tactical progression toward resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of identity, ownership, and autonomy emerges organically through the custody battle metaphor and the brain's awakening. The final image of Kael and the autonomous light-being facing "the horizon where time bled into possibility" resonantly answers questions about self-possession without explicit moralizing. The concept of becoming "no one so he could feel everything" effectively explores ego dissolution versus emotional presence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Kael's consciousness while respecting boundaries around other characters' interiority. The prose texture shifts appropriately between philosophical abstraction and concrete sensory detail. The duplicate brain's voice ("I remember your pain. I do not want to inherit it") is distinctly non-gendered and ageless, though some passages drift into elevated register that occasionally obscures immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in passages like "becoming no one so he could feel everything." However, several abstract philosophical passages ("the tension between what was lost and what might yet be") and repetitive constructions around "complementary opposites" create minor density issues. The final sequences achieve good momentum despite occasional overwriting in the metaphysical descriptions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a custody battle over a duplicate brain fought through temporal fractures and reality rewrites offers genuine originality. The transformation of ego death from loss into a path toward feeling elevates familiar spiritual concepts through specific dramatization. The brain's evolution into pure light-consciousness rather than flesh provides an unexpected resolution that feels earned through the established metaphysics.</comment>
