<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elira's prism-minded perception drives authentic choices throughout, particularly her ability to decode the seventh eye only during gravity's inversion. Her progression from archivist to awakener of vigilance feels earned through concrete actions rather than epiphany. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("each synaptic thread glowing") that lacks embodied specificity during peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase building to Resonant Reconfiguration—Elira awakens the Seed with visible cost (the chamber sealing permanently behind her). The seventh eye revelation and subsequent chamber discovery follow causal linkage. Slight deduction for delayed orientation (grotto's exact nature unclear until mid-story) though this serves the mystical atmosphere.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The inverted gravity fundamentally constrains navigation ("forced her to walk upside-down") and enables discovery of Fragment Delta. Phosphorescent moss, floating silt, and the chamber of glass tablets create lived-in specificity. The Seed of Vigilance as final object charges the ending with its warmth and whispers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding the seventh eye to access forgotten knowledge) escalates through Elira's agency—fusing fragments, tracing the sigil, speaking dialects. The permanent sealing of the chamber provides clear cost. Minor deduction for relatively smooth progression without significant resistance once gravity inverts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of hidden knowledge requiring patient observation emerges through concrete details—margins as repositories, doodles as keys, vigilance "seeded" rather than enforced. The final image of planning "her next reentry" resonates without stating a moral. Slight deduction for one instance of abstract philosophizing about vigilance protection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled mystical register ("clandestinely luminous," "spectral halos") that maintains consistency. Clean third-person limited with no head-hopping. Deduction for occasional overwriting that prioritizes atmosphere over clarity ("each synaptic thread glowing with clandestine luminescence") and some filter-verb clustering in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Several instances of overwrought figurative language ("like a bat made of parchment," "sound like tearing silk") and repetitive use of "clandestinely luminous" variants. Template cadence appears in places ("She stepped...She seized it...She pressed...") though not pervasive enough for major penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archive mystery with gravity-inversion mechanics creates non-obvious stakes. The concept of vigilance hidden in marginalia rather than fortresses offers genuine insight. Transformation of the "lost knowledge" trope through specific world-building (Hollow Tongue dialects, inverted gravity window) elevates beyond template.</comment>
