<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation as a grief cartographer who "perceived patterns in what others dismissed as voids" is consistently rendered through concrete actions—interviewing fisherfolk, matching melodies to valve mechanisms, creating navigation charts of absence. The protagonist's choice to propose communal naming rather than monuments demonstrates earned character development with visible cost (the town's initial skepticism, years of patient work).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered discoveries (widow's melody, shipwright's chime, offerings) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the town adopts a ritual of naming. The closure lands with felt cost: "The absences did not vanish; they became acknowledged, woven into the rhythm of waves and wind." The persistent constraint of working with fragments and voids shapes Elira's methods throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ivory harbor setting actively constrains choices—salt preserves truths, fog whispers coordinates, the customs house attic becomes an archive of "salt-warped ledgers." While vivid ("bruised sky, slick cobblestones"), the environment could more directly pressure Elira's decisions rather than serving primarily as atmospheric backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: from personal investigation to communal healing, with the trumpet valve as cipher evolving into "a mute compass pointing to all that had been loved and lost." The meaningful tightening occurs when Elira presents her findings to the council, risking rejection for an unconventional memorial approach that honors absence rather than presence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the recurring motif of navigating absence—the trumpet valve transforms from archaeological artifact to symbol of communal memory. The final image of children asking about the untouched rust offers a non-literal answer: "That's how we learned to sail through silence." No explicit moralizing; the meaning accrues through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance with distinctive voice ("salt clinging to her woolen shawl like forgotten prayers"). However, occasional register elevation strains credibility ("letting loss guide her toward revelation") and some passages drift toward explanatory rather than embodied narration, particularly in the middle exposition about her methods.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While prose achieves moments of lyric precision ("absences—those hollows where voices, ships, and histories had once thrived"), repetitive constructions emerge: multiple "She [verb]" openings, conceptual loops around absence/loss/memory. The phrase "staggered intervals" appears twice identically. Information density is uneven, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others merely restate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of an "ocean-spray archivist" who maps grief into geography offers genuine freshness—not through surface novelty but through specific execution of how absence becomes navigational data. The ritual of seasonal naming as memorial transforms the typical monument trope. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens resonance without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
