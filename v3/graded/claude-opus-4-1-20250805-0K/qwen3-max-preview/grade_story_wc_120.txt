<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to conduct unheard symphonies from memory is clear and compelling, with concrete embodied details like pressing palm to shell and conducting with wrist flicks. The transformation from fortune cookie writer to memory conductor shows genuine character evolution through specific actions. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "chronologically homesick" that could be more embodied, though the exhaustion constraint adds urgency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered memories building to the symphonic crescendo. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she "remembered how to try," with visible cost in the exhaustion rule and the glass spire's vibration. The orientation anchors (glass spire, frozen lake, fortune cookie writer) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The glass spire and frozen lake create vivid, constraining setting that shapes her ritual and enables the memory-conducting. The nautilus shell functions as micro-setting that constrains choice through its spiral structure guiding memory mapping. Sensory details like "frost feathered the glass floor in fractal lace" and the mirrored surfaces catching stars enhance atmosphere while the setting's resonance with her conducting charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of conducting memory-symphonies before exhaustion creates clear pressure that builds through accumulation of specific memories (mother's kitchen, oak tree, father whistling). The exhaustion constraint genuinely limits her time and forces the final push. Cost is visible in the glass spire vibrating and lake cracking, though the resolution could show more immediate physical/emotional price beyond just smiling at remembering "how to try."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of memory from loss to musical score, avoiding direct statements. The nautilus spiral as metaphor for recursive memory that "deepens, not linearly" provides sophisticated thematic resonance. The ending reweights memory as creative material rather than mere nostalgia, though the final line about "remembered how to try" edges slightly toward explicit resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical compression and purposeful elision ("chronologically homesick," "upturned hush"). The perceptual signature of seeing memory as musical composition is consistent throughout. Minor register elevation in phrases like "logarithmic spiral" and some abstract constructions ("threshold stitched between what was and what might still sing") occasionally distance from immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in memory sequences that build both scene and symphony. Rhythm varies effectively between longer descriptive passages and short declarative beats. Some abstract phrasing ("chronologically homesick," "what might still sing") and occasional register drift into elevated diction reduce clarity, though the prose maintains momentum toward closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of conducting memories as unheard symphonies offers fresh synthesis of familiar elements. The transformation from fortune cookie writer to memory conductor shows genuine innovation. The specific detail of memories becoming musical instruments (pots as woodblocks, branch as timpani) elevates execution. Risk-taking in the lyrical, non-linear approach heightens meaning without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
