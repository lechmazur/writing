I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and memory fragments toward a resonant reconfiguration where Aris transforms from engineer to "keeper of lost light."

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris's transformation from engineer to dream archeologist is well-motivated through concrete sensory details ("hands trembled...from the quaking reverie") and embodied emotional responses to the entangled memories. The internal conflict between his engineering precision and chaotic methodology creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("profound transformation") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Aris becomes "keeper of lost light," with visible cost in processing others' pain ("wept, not for the loss, but for the beauty"). The accumulative structure builds coherently through memory fragments to this transformation. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the Dream Archive concept.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon setting effectively constrains the scene and the broken mirror shards create specific tactile details ("tools scattered like fallen stars"). The Dream Archive's buried state mirrors the abandoned dreams thematically. The canyon's "breath" and embracing night in the closing enhance the atmosphere of excavation beginning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal transformation to collective duty as Aris processes increasingly painful memories ("children laughing in a sun-drenched meadow that no longer existed"). The cost manifests physically through the "synaptic storm" and emotionally through witnessing lost dreams. The pressure coheres well under the accumulative lens as density increases toward the closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of salvaging abandoned hopes emerges organically through the mirror's fragments and specific dream-memories rather than abstract statements. The final image of beginning an excavation resonates without moralizing. Strong subtext in "the silence did not feel empty" suggesting hope's return through remembrance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent lyrical-technical register befitting a "helix-minded engineer" with phrases like "chaotically precise" and "synaptic plasticity." Some filter verbs ("He saw," "He felt") slightly dull immediacy in the memory sequence. The perceptual signature of spiraling thought patterns is distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery ("fallen stars," "fractured pieces"). Some redundancy in the memory sequence with multiple "He saw/felt" constructions creating minor template cadence. A few abstract phrases ("profound transformation," "psychic rubble") could be more concrete. Information density is good with most lines advancing multiple story elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a broken periscope mirror containing entangled memories offers fresh specificity, avoiding generic memory-device tropes. The synthesis of engineering precision with chaotic methodology creates an original character approach. The Dream Archive as failed repository transforms familiar post-apocalyptic elements through emotional particularity.</comment>
