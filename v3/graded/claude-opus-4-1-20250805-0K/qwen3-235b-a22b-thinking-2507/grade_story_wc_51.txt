<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between collecting burdens and bearing her own fractal weaver's curse creates genuine tension. The embodied details like "movements slow as whalebone reverie" and physical interaction with the calcified burdens ground her emotional state. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the "fractal weaver's curse" which could use more concrete dramatization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the collection of burdens and culminating in Elara's Earned Stasis—accepting her trapped state while continuing her work. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by ~100 words. Cost is visible in her being "boundary-lessly trapped" with winter sealing the entrance, though the emotional price could be more sharply felt at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bronze grotto functions as both setting and constraint, with its "boundary-lessly trapped" nature directly shaping Elara's choices. Sensory details like "damp earth," "shingled hush," and the interplay of starlight and lamp flame create vivid atmosphere. The setting actively participates in the ritual through the bronze walls' "low, metallic dirge" and the necessity of proper orientation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting calcified burdens while bearing her own—escalates through two distinct collections, each requiring more precise ritual and extracting greater cost. The progression from teardrop stone to rope-shaped betrayal shows meaningful deepening. The final sealing of the grotto by snowfall creates irreversible pressure, though agency in the final beat could be stronger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of emotional burdens becoming physical stones, avoiding abstract moralizing. The fractal weaver's curse—creating "infinite regrets that now calcified within her chest"—resonates with the collected burdens without explicit parallel. The ending's acceptance of endless work offers a non-literal answer about bearing witness to others' pain while carrying one's own.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with phrases like "whalebone reverie" and "shingled hush" that reflect Elara's contemplative state. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Some elevated diction ("boundary-lessly trapped," "calcified essence") occasionally strains against naturalism but serves the mythic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of key phrases that accumulate meaning. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("bronze grotto seemed to breathe") and some template cadence in the collection sequences ("She approached...She lifted...").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of emotional burdens calcifying into collectible stones offers a fresh take on grief and memory. The specific ritual of orientation with the lamp burner creates original mechanics for the fantastical premise. The fractal weaver profession and its particular curse of infinite branching regrets adds distinctive texture beyond generic magic.</comment>
