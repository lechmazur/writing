<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas's shadow-woven nature creates genuine internal tension between empathetic connection and peacekeeper duty, particularly when feeling Kael's grief turn to shame. The reconstitution choice drives from consistent intuitive traits, though some emotional transitions (particularly the clans' instant acceptance) lack intermediate struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with mirrors accumulating temporal glimpses toward reconstitution. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the crystal reveals the nephew's rescue, transforming clan antagonism into cooperation with visible emotional cost (tears, trembling hand, shame). The mirror-glimpse mechanism feels slightly convenient but pays off through specific image-to-action mapping.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes creates constant environmental pressure—crevasses swallow children, ice instability fractures trust. The vintage store's mirrors constrain Silas's method of reconstitution through their temporal echoes. Setting directly shapes the conflict though some spatial transitions between orchard/store/lighthouse could be clearer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from abstract distrust to Kael's raised fist threatening violence, with the "weighted breath before reply" creating palpable tension. The crystal's revelation transforms imminent conflict into reconciliation with clear cost—Kael's shame, his wife's tears. One meaningful deepening that reweights all prior suspicion into tragic misunderstanding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of "mapping empathy onto action"—the crystal doesn't predict but reveals hidden compassion. The final image of lanterns along the cliff path resonates as bridges over chaos without stating morals. Some thematic language ("courageous anomaly") occasionally feels prompt-derived rather than fully organic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice weaves shadow imagery throughout ("shadows, woven like silver thread") with controlled lyric rhythm. POV remains stable with Silas's intuitive perception filtering observations. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("weighted breath before reply" repeated four times) that occasionally obscures momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves density through compound images like "apple trees sighing above the groaning ice floes" but suffers from repetitive stems ("Silas" opens 14 sentences). The "weighted breath before reply" phrase appears four times, creating template cadence. Strong information density when describing mirror visions but some filter-verb clustering ("Silas watched," "Silas felt").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of shadow-being peacekeeper using broken artifacts to restore empathy rather than wielding traditional power. The mirror-time mechanic offers an inventive reconstitution method. However, the resolution's emotional arithmetic (instant forgiveness) and some prompt-echo phrases ("courageous anomaly") prevent full originality.</comment>
