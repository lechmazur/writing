I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a "contact tracer for hearts" drives consistent choices through concrete embodied details like the hearing aid's warmth and her physical tracking of Agnes's signal. The internal conflict between her role to "assure" versus following Agnes's urgent plea creates genuine tension. However, the convenience of her childhood gift and the slightly neat resolution prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Decisive Change when Elara's discovery prevents the wall collapse, with visible cost in the evacuation and "relieved sobs." The causal chain from hearing aid signal to photograph to structural warning holds cleanly. Orientation anchors (Elara, atrium, twilight) establish by ~50 words. The lens reads as Causal with clear because/therefore linkages narrowing options toward the crisis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium with its "crumbling marble benches" and "moss-eaten fountain" creates atmospheric pressure that mirrors the ghostly presence. The hearing aid as micro-setting constrains Elara's tracking method effectively. The structural flaw in the north wall becomes the pivotal environmental constraint. However, some sensory details feel decorative rather than essential to choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal grief counseling to life-threatening structural collapse, with the hearing aid's "frantic" pulse spike marking the tightening. Elara's agency drives the resolution through her sprint to the caretaker. The cost lands visibly in the evacuation "just as the first plaster cracks spiderwebbed." One meaningful tightening from emotional to physical danger satisfies scope requirements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of love transcending death to protect the living emerges through Agnes's warning rather than mere comfort. The photograph transforms from sentimental object to crucial evidence. The final line "love, once traced, never truly fades" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the opening premise. Some thematic statements like "vulnerable voices" edge toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third with Elara's perceptual signature in phrases like "fragile echoes of love" and physical tracking details. No dialogue appears, avoiding potential pitfalls. Some elevated diction ("residual pulses of unresolved emotion") occasionally drifts from urgency. The POV holds stable without head-hopping, though filter phrases like "She'd seen" appear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments like "whispers threading through the damp air like cobwebs against skin" but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing too frequently in high-pressure beats. Template cadence emerges in "She'd spent years... She'd seen blueprints... She sprinted." The paraphrase loop of "vulnerable voices" weakens momentum. Information density is uneven with some scaffolding phrases.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of tracking ghosts through obsolete technology offers freshness, particularly the hearing aid's ability to catch "what modern tech missed." The transformation from grief counseling to physical rescue provides an unexpected turn. However, the ghost-warning-of-danger trope is familiar, and some elements feel templated despite specific execution.</comment>
