<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to help others despite destitution is clear, but his internal experience lacks embodied contradiction and relies on abstract labels ("heart full of purpose," "quiet creed"). The transformation insight arrives through summary ("Transformation wasn't abstract; it was the weight of an empty wallet") rather than dramatized struggle. Character choices feel predetermined rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The piece operates as Accumulative/Textural but lacks a clear closure with visible cost—Aris simply walks away enlightened without paying a price or making a decisive choice. The volcano calming coincidentally through his presence undermines agency. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words, preventing lower scores.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Black sand beach and volcanic setting create vivid sensory detail with phosphorescent glow and texture, though descriptions sometimes prioritize atmosphere over constraint ("black sand stretched toward the brooding volcano"). The seawater and sand do enable Aris's mission, providing functional integration beyond mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract—"understanding transformation" never faces concrete test or opposition. The child's fever provides external purpose but no actual conflict emerges. Escalation is absent; the volcano calms through coincidence rather than Aris's agency, and no meaningful choice narrows his options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through generosity emerges through events but resolves into explicit thesis statements ("transformation was a dance of small, luminous steps"). The ending tells rather than resonates. Subtext operates better in the hermit crab moment than in Aris's direct realizations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature, defaulting to elevated literary register ("celestial ballet," "ethereal light") that doesn't reflect a destitute wanderer's perspective. No dialogue to evaluate. POV remains stable throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Prose suffers from overwriting with figurative language in most sentences ("black sand stretched toward the brooding volcano," "vibrant hush enveloped the shore") and abstract philosophical assertions. Template cadence appears ("He'd come seeking... He'd taken... He'd yearned"). The final paragraph explicitly moralizes rather than dramatizing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The destitute philanthropist with bottled lightning bugs offers an interesting premise, but execution relies on convenient coincidences and the prophecy resolution feels unearned. The concept of finding transformation's texture through poverty has potential but resolves through telling rather than discovery.</comment>
