<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elena's prosopagnosia creates genuine contradiction between her role as portrait artist and inability to recognize faces, driving methodical compensation strategies. Her motivation to awaken dormant empathy emerges through concrete ritual actions at the quarry. The witness's emotional breakthrough ("I forgot how much she mattered") lands with earned cost, though his convenient appearance strains causality slightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as Elena's ritualistic returns and methodical documentation build toward the witness's emergence and empathy awakening. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elena's non-facial portrait catalyzes the witness's tears and confession, with emotional cost visible in "tears cutting tracks through the dust." Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words with Elena as portrait artist at the quarry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The quarry's "furrowed hush" and mist create oppressive atmosphere that Elena must anchor against through measurement rituals. The ribbon fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining her artistic approach and charging the final portrait. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from cliff edge to pool to town departure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Elena's private failure through her ritual documentation to the public portrait creation that "lances the silence." The witness's emergence provides external pressure that validates her unconventional approach. Cost manifests in seven years of weekly returns and the town's dormant empathy finally awakening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the masquerade paradox: "Masks show us who we fear being, not who we are." Elena's face-blindness becomes thematic strength, seeing "beyond" concealment to essence. The faceless portrait resonates as answer to the central question of how to remember someone truly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formality with selective perception shaped by Elena's methodical nature and artistic eye. Dialogue feels natural when the witness speaks with appropriate emotional thickness. Some filter verb clusters ("Elena felt," "she remembered") slightly dull immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("tears cutting tracks through the dust") but suffers from repetitive "She [verb]" openings across multiple paragraphs. Several paraphrase loops appear ("dormant empathy" stated multiple times without variation). Information density varies, with some passages doing single duty where compression would strengthen momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prosopagnosia as asset rather than limitation offers fresh angle on portrait artistry and witness identification. The non-facial portrait capturing essence through objects transforms expected detective procedural beats. Elena's methodical ritual returns to measure and document show specific character response to failure.</comment>
