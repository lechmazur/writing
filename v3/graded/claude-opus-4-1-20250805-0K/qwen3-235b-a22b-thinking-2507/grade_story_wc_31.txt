<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's synesthetic quest drives consistent motivation through concrete sensory details and embodied discovery. His transformation from routine lamplighter to seeker of luminous truth lands with earned cost when he absorbs the color of courage. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in emotional processing ("he lived it") rather than fully embodied sensation at the peak moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration through the discovery of luminous vows that makes sound visible. The skeleton key tag's cipher revelation provides causal linkage to the closure where Aris carries "the color of courage within him." Cost is felt through the vows of sailors lost at sea and Aris's own unspoken vow taking shape.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken library constrains access through tidal timing and creates atmospheric pressure through "meteor hush" stillness. Sensory hierarchy reflects Aris's synesthetic perception effectively. Deduction for some overwriting in descriptive passages that occasionally prioritizes atmosphere over momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine duty to personal quest to universal truth about sound's color. The tidal constraint creates urgency, and discovering the vows deepens pressure through emotional resonance. However, the conflict lacks a decisive trade-off or foreclosed option at closure beyond abstract enlightenment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the luminous vows revealing that truth requires "both darkness and light to be understood." The grandmother's riddle pays off meaningfully, and the convergence of sky lanterns with sunken words creates resonant duality without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct voice with synesthetic perception and maritime vocabulary appropriate to the lamplighter POV. Some register drift into elevated diction ("meteor hush," "ascending stars") that occasionally exceeds the character's established lexicon. Clean POV control throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied rhythm, but multiple instances of overwriting diminish momentum: "ascending stars," "skeletal ribs," "liquid twilight." Template cadence appears in the discovery sequence ("He traced...," "Another vow...," "But the heart..."). Mixed metaphor with "meteor hush" in a submarine setting strains coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia with maritime ghost story creates memorable premise. The luminous vows written in phosphorescent algae offer genuine originality. The transformation of a skeleton key tag into a cipher that projects sound's color shows inventive detail work.</comment>
