<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is deeply rooted in communal need (village children's stolen sleep) and drives increasingly desperate actions through the sonic chaos. His cool-headed nature holds under extreme pressure, though the internal experience could be more contradictory—he remains perhaps too composed during the garden's violent unraveling. The final moment of kneeling in "true silence" shows earned change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with pattern-breaking as the central mechanism, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kael captures the goddess's echo. The cost is felt through the village's exhaustion and children's cries, though the immediate physical/emotional toll on Kael could be more explicit. Causality holds as each action (striking spike, navigating chaos, casting net) builds toward the earned capture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden functions as both setting and antagonist, with sonic lilies and the Heartstone Basin constraining Kael's choices throughout. The synesthetic rendering of sound as physical space ("shards of shattered sound that hung like glass") makes navigation consequential. The environment directly shapes tactics—the zigzag dance through disintegrating paths—and charges the final image of settling silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from garden's hum shattering to full cosmic disorder (constellations sleepwalking), forcing Kael's desperate zigzag survival dance. The pressure coheres through sonic accumulation, with each failed harmony raising the cost. The final casting of the "net of woven silence" represents agency under maximum pressure, though the resolution feels slightly too smooth given the established chaos.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "voicing silence" and catching echoes of lost order, with the "feral lullaby for a broken world" crystallizing this tension. The piece resists simple restoration narrative—order returns but changed, wild yet soothing. The final image of silence settling "like snow, gentle and deep" offers resonant answer to the opening's sonic overwhelming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through synesthetic rendering (sound as physical space, notes as visible ripples), though some constructions feel overwrought ("sleepwalking constellations...like drunkards stumbling home"). Voice maintains mythic register consistently but occasionally strains with elevated diction. The phrase "transliterates emotions" appears twice without variation, suggesting template rather than organic voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong momentum with vivid sensory work, but several overwrought constructions slow key beats ("the goddess's echo—if it existed—would surface here"). The repetition of "transliterates emotions" without variation suggests scaffold. Some mixed metaphors strain coherence (stars as both sleepwalkers and drunkards). Information density is high but occasionally tips into purple prose during action sequences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of sonic ecology with mythic quest narrative feels fresh, particularly the concept of fishing for echoes with "nets of woven silence." The specific detail of rail spike as resonance tool and the synesthetic treatment of sound elevate familiar quest structure. Risk-taking in the prose style mostly succeeds, though occasionally overreaches into ornament.</comment>
