<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied discovery—the urn fragment physically freezing time, the gear warm to touch—creating genuine urgency around understanding "time's texture." The contradictory impulses between following forbidden communication channels and her duty as timekeeper play out through concrete actions rather than summary, though the resolution lacks a sharper personal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through pattern accumulation: fragment→gear→voice→revelation, each discovery densifying meaning until the final image of Elara as "keeper of borrowed hours" waiting for "the next fragment." The closure achieves Charged Poise—she crystallizes into her role with visible commitment to continue the dangerous message-embedding, though the cost could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald silo functions as living architecture—humming, pulsing, acknowledging pleas—while sensory specifics like "ash whispering from its jagged lip" and the gear "warm to the touch" create tactile immediacy. The world-building of "numbers changed meaning" and emotional calendars establishes consistent rules that constrain communication methods, directly shaping Elara's garage-sale solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating discoveries that narrow options: finding the fragment triggers the search, the gear reveals the silo's true nature as vault, forcing Elara to accept her role as message-keeper despite monitoring authorities. The texture metaphor—"not smooth flow, but fracture and mending"—deepens rather than reverses, though the authorities' threat remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of time as texture rather than measurement emerges through concrete particulars: broken clay's roughness, the gear's warmth, "stitch by fragile stitch." The final image of patience as time's texture resonates without stating a moral, reweighting the opening's "borrowed hours" into purposeful waiting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The perceptual signature of someone who "feels time's texture" manifests in selective attention to resonance and material traces—indigo symbols, humming frequencies, mineral-encoded sorrow. Voice occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("anticipated mysteries coiled in the air") that slightly exceeds the established POV lexicon, and dialogue absence prevents full voice distinction testing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline specificity—"ash whispering from its jagged lip"—but suffers from register drift into academic abstraction ("deliberate trail," "residual energy") and occasional template phrasing ("heart pounding with anticipated mysteries"). The filter-verb stack in the Miller's sale sequence ("spotted," "handed," "lay") dulls immediacy during a discovery beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of time-as-texture in a post-Shift world where "numbers changed meaning" offers genuine freshness, particularly the garage-sale communication method emerging organically from world constraints. The self-addressed message twist transforms the time-loop trope through material specificity, though some genre familiarity remains.</comment>
