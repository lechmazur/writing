<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris's bewilderment manifests through embodied reactions ("disbelief tightening his throat") and his progression from "brightened disquiet" to "focused calm" to "starlit peace" tracks a genuine arc. The philosophical breakthrough in the lavatory shows internal contradiction between following Archive directives and pursuing understanding. However, the emotional resolution feels slightly rushed, and the transformation from bewilderment to peace could use more intermediate struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with effective Conceptual Repricing closure where understanding non-linear time becomes the cost itself ("a truth humanity wasn't ready to bear"). The temporal loop structure (finding/placing the cameo) creates a resonant reconfiguration with clear stakes. The piece teaches its non-linear pattern early and pays it off through the inheritance paradox.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Astral Orchard's crystalline trees with "bioluminescent petals" that "pulsed with light" create vivid, purposeful imagery that mirrors the temporal paradox. The pistachio shell cameo becomes micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. The lavatory as refuge space works thematically ("forbidden knowledge sought in the quiet of a spaceship bathroom"), though some descriptions edge toward ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from observation mission to understanding time's structure to participating in the temporal loop. The dominant stake (pursuing forbidden knowledge) tightens when Aris must choose between Archive directives and understanding. The cost becomes legible when he sees himself completing the loop, though the middle section could apply more pressure before the breakthrough.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the blank cameo that contains "every possible image it could ever hold," embodying non-linear inheritance without exposition. The final image of Aris placing the cameo offers a non-literal answer about time as "a garden where all blooms existed at once." The "simply complicated" paradox resonates throughout without being stated as moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent academic-explorer register with effective modulation ("the absurdity struck him"). Some passages drift toward elevated diction ("velvet void," "regolith") but remain within character. The philosophical breakthrough section risks register drift but recovers through specificity. Minor filter verb accumulation ("He felt," "He saw") dulls immediacy in places.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some ornamental phrases ("frozen stars," "velvet void") and repetitive structures appear. The philosophical breakthrough paragraph contains slight paraphrase loops around the inheritance concept. Information density is moderate; most sentences advance the story but some descriptive passages could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The temporal paradox of finding what you will place transforms familiar time-loop concepts through specific execution. The "pistachio shell cameo blank" as inheritance vessel is genuinely unexpected. The bathroom as site of cosmic revelation subverts expectations effectively, though the resolution edges toward safety in its neat circular closure.</comment>
