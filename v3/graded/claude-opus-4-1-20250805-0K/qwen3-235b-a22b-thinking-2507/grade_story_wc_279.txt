<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "discover meaning in the mess" drives concrete choices through sand mandala creation, though internal contradiction remains mostly told rather than shown in simultaneous impulses. The transformation from individual uncertainty to collective understanding earns its cost through the specific act of reshaping chaos into order. Social perceptiveness manifests in noticing tension but could deepen through more embodied reaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through mandala creation, tile integration, and the "emergent hush" that crystallizes collective understanding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the mandala's transformation enables shared meaning, with cost visible in tears and the letting-go of certainties. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The grotto's mist, wet stone scent, and curved whispering walls create atmospheric pressure, with the tile flake's vibration constraining Elara's choice to integrate it as the mandala's center. Sensory detail focuses appropriately on tactile sand grains and visual color spirals during the work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding meaning amid unlearning—tightens when the "emergent hush" forces Elara's wordless intervention through mandala reshaping. Cost registers in the community's visible transformation from "lilac unease" to "gentle resolve," though agency could strengthen through more resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the mandala's physical transformation from "disarray" to "spiral of order," avoiding explicit moralizing until slight slippage in "Meaning wasn't a straight line." The tile flake's evolution from fragment to "vessel for their voice" carries thematic weight through concrete object rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm in "spirals of ochre, cobalt, and burnt sienna," though occasional overreach appears in "the emergent hush deepening, vibrating in the tile flake." POV stability holds without head-hopping, perception filtered through artist's attention to color and pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong compression like "This was the time of unlearning," but suffers from repetitive "emergent hush" (4x), "lilac unease" (3x), and abstract phrasing like "quiet triumph of connection." Template cadence appears in final third with repeated "The [noun] [verb]" structures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The sand mandala as temporary art addressing permanent questions offers a fresh angle, particularly when the tile flake transforms from whisper-holder to community vessel. However, the "unlearning" framework and transformation-through-art resolution follow familiar workshop patterns without sufficient specificity to fully distinguish.</comment>
