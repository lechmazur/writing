<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's rejection of false comfort drives a genuine internal conflict between accepting illusions and building from reality, with his final choice to conceive rather than wish carrying visible cost. His motivation intensifies from passive observation to active mental labor, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the middle section.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the working memory sequence building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where lanterns reignite—not from magic but from rekindled will. The closure lands with conceptual cost (rejecting easier magical solutions for harder mental labor) and the bottle transforms from potential escape to "symbol of future's potential."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Cove's transformation from "wooden buildings leaning like weary bones" to streets that could be "painted in hues of gold and courage" constrains the alchemist's choices—he must work within desolation. The amber bottle and paper lanterns function as micro-settings that charge the final image, though some middle passages lean toward abstract description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal loss through communal absence to the pressure of conceiving an entire civilization in working memory, with each detail threatening to "unravel" if forgotten. The cost is legible in his strained mental labor and rejection of the bottle's "false comfort," though the middle section could tighten the pressure more viscerally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between wished-away sorrows and acknowledged grief, culminating in lanterns lit "not from a candle, but from the rekindled will within him." The bottle's transformation from temptation to witness offers a non-literal answer about building from reality rather than escaping into illusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm ("salt-bleached pier," "fossilized tears") and purposeful compression in the working memory sequence. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("ghost town lay silent, its wooden buildings leaning like weary bones") that slightly exceeds the alchemist's established lexicon during non-peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong opening with "deserted alchemist" creating immediate intrigue and varied sentence structures throughout. Minor template cadence in the civilization-building sequence ("First, the streets... Then, the people...") and occasional abstract phrasing ("vastness in a single mind") that could be more concrete, but prose generally maintains momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory palace technique with post-apocalyptic rebuilding, where civilization exists first as mental architecture. The twist that lanterns ignite from will rather than magic transforms the expected fantasy resolution, though the core "last survivor rebuilds" frame is familiar.</comment>
