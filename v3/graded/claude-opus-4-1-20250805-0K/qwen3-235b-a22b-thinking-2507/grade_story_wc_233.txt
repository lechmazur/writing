<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's disenchantment and subsequent transformation through memory (daughter's hand, fireflies with Lyra) drives genuine change with visible cost. The contradictory impulses—weariness versus duty, despair versus love—act simultaneously in scene, particularly when she draws on the "shared exhale" memory to command the bleeding starlight. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of "commanding" the cosmic wound rather than more embodied action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds from personal grief through cosmic discovery to mythic resolution, with the firefly memory serving as the pivotal reweighting element. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara transforms from "disenchanted" to "carrying the sky's fragile peace," with cost visible in the "weight of the crown she finally understood." Deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution mechanism where willpower alone seals a cosmic wound.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto's transformation from expected "ember grotto" to suspended celestial wound creates strong atmospheric pressure. Visceral details like "viscous strands of silver light oozed from the highest fissures, dripping like molten mercury" and "cold as forgotten graves" ground the fantastical elements. The setting directly constrains choice when the bleeding starlight "lapped at her boots," forcing immediate action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds from personal exhaustion through cosmic discovery to the moment where "bleeding starlight lapped at her boots," forcing confrontation. The stakes escalate from kingdom's evacuation to understanding the celestial hemorrhage threatens everything. Cost is visible but the resolution through pure will lacks the physical or sacrificial price that would elevate further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The firefly memory beautifully reweights from simple nostalgia to source of power, transforming "captured hope" into the mechanism for healing cosmic wounds. Theme emerges through the connection between personal love (daughter) and cosmic responsibility (kingdom) without explicit moralizing. The final image of Elara "carrying the sky's fragile peace within her" offers resonant closure that reframes the opening's disenchantment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with selective details like "boots scuffing the obsidian shale" and "star-scented air." Voice maintains consistency through lyrical descriptions while modulating appropriately during the climactic command sequence. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("velvet darkness laced with crystalline poison") that slightly exceeds the established voice's range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative imagery like "falling stars weeping liquid light" and strong rhythmic control. Some overwriting in passages like "velvet darkness laced with crystalline poison" and "the lacy menace of the place deepened." Information density is high but occasional metaphor stacking ("bleeding starlight," "crystalline poison," "lacy menace") creates minor congestion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The transformation of expected "ember grotto" into "cobalt grotto above clouds" with bleeding starlight offers genuine surprise. The synthesis of personal memory (fireflies with daughter) as the mechanism to heal cosmic wounds creates non-obvious resonance. The piece takes risks with its mythic register and cosmic scope while maintaining emotional grounding through specific memories.</comment>
