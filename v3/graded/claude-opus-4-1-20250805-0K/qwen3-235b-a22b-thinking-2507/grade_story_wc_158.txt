I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to "photosynthesize pain into beauty" drives consistent internal struggle, with embodied emotional states (insomnia as "relentless tidepool," pain dissolving "like sugar in tea"). The transformation from wrestling with wakefulness to achieving peace feels earned through accumulated imagery rather than sudden epiphany, though the character remains somewhat archetypal rather than fully individualized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building density through layered imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the poet achieves his "blossom armistice" with visible cost ("centuries of longing"). The closure lands with the poet finally sleeping after transforming pain into beauty, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than stated temporally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell functions as both setting and constraint, its "pearlescent walls curving like a cathedral" and "labyrinthine corridors" shaping the poet's isolation and amplifying his creative process. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("blood-orange moon," "liquid emerald" light), with the shell's evolving nature ("merely a hollow in the dunes" to "cathedral of calcium") constraining choices and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—achieving peace through artistic transformation—escalates through accumulating imagery and the poet's "shyly unstoppable" persistence against centuries of insomnia. The "first blossom of truce blooming in his palm" marks a meaningful deepening that reweights his struggle, though the conflict lacks external pressure or concrete opposition beyond time itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the photosynthesis metaphor and accumulated imagery of transformation, avoiding explicit moralizing. The "reef-shadow joy" concept offers a nuanced answer to suffering—not triumph but "cool, dappled contentment," with the final image of the shell "cradling the poet's quiet victory" resonating without stating meaning directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistency with purposeful compression and patterned metaphorical language ("tidepool reflecting fractured starlight," "grief's acid into verse"). POV remains stable without head-hopping, though some phrases edge toward purple prose ("blood-orange moon clawed the horizon") that slightly strain the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong information density with most lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("gargantuan," "pearlescent," "labyrinthine" cluster densely). Some metaphors strain credibility ("blood-orange moon clawed"), and there's minor repetition of "shyly unstoppable" without sufficient variation, but overall momentum and clarity remain intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of photosynthesizing pain into beauty offers a fresh angle on the suffering artist trope, with specific details like the "galaxy postcard" and "reef-shadow joy" avoiding generic templates. The synthesis of natural imagery with artistic creation feels organic, though the insomniac poet archetype itself is familiar territory.</comment>
