<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—providing meaningful closure through music therapy—with concrete embodied emotion in Aris's tear, trembling hand tracing melody, and final benediction. The internal conflict between medical protocol and spiritual need drives her "decisively kind" insistence on the rooftop setting. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("sacred space," "healing sometimes meant releasing the breath") in early beats, though the closure moment lands with earned cost through specific physical gestures.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered sounds (oxygen concentrator, pigeon, wind-catchers) building to the vinyl fragment's haunting phrase that triggers Aris's reconnection. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost: Aris achieves his "flawless goodbye" through reunion with his childhood self, sealed by his serene release. The piece teaches its "hymning the mundane" pattern early and pays it off through transformation of mechanical hospital sounds into sacred vessel.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rooftop garden setting actively constrains choice—Elara must override protocol objections to bring Aris outside where "he needed the sky, the wind, the vastness." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: the vinyl shard "catching afternoon light," the "cloud-sea" below, lavender scent mixing with "damp earth after brief shower." The setting enables the final transformation, though some descriptions edge toward ornamental ("radiant haven," "golden-hour glow").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—achieving meaningful closure before death—is signaled immediately and tightens through Elara's protocol-breaking decision to move Aris outside. The vinyl fragment creates genuine risk (it might not play, might traumatize rather than heal) that pays off when it triggers Aris's profound reconnection. Cost is visible in the tear, trembling hand, and ultimate release, though escalation relies more on accumulation than reversal under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of mundane hospital sounds into sacred music, avoiding direct moralizing. The vinyl fragment's journey from "demolished childhood home" to final benediction creates resonance without stating meaning. The ending offers a non-literal answer about how memory and music transcend bodily limits, with the "scent of hope" evolving from metaphor to literal lavender and damp earth, though some early abstractions ("sacred space") slightly diminish organic emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elara's musical consciousness—she perceives the oxygen concentrator as rhythm, transforms ambient sounds into "sacred vessel." POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance, though some register elevation occurs ("papery skin," "profound hum"). The prose modulates effectively under pressure, shifting from longer descriptive passages to shorter, more immediate observations as Aris responds to the music.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "needed not more treatments, but a flawless goodbye" followed immediately by similar restatement. Template cadence appears in "She gathered...This shard...It was..." sequence. Overwriting in metaphorical density ("fading like an old photograph left in the sun," "calm harbor in the storm of endings") without pattern-teaching, particularly dense in opening third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The core concept of using a broken vinyl fragment from a flood-destroyed home to create final meaning shows genuine originality. The synthesis of music therapy with hospice care through "hymning the mundane" offers a fresh angle on death narratives. However, some elements feel templated (wise caregiver, peaceful death scene), and the metaphorical language occasionally relies on familiar constructions ("storm of endings," "ghost of his mother's favorite hymn").</comment>
