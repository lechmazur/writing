<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is crystalline—reimagining civilization through understanding rather than dogma—and her internal contradiction between revolutionary past and present regret creates genuine tension. The moment with the shard demonstration shows her values hierarchy clearly, choosing proof over ideology with visible cost. Slight deduction for some abstract phrasing ("poetic soul drowned in burnished sorrow") that approaches label-speak without full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal closure where Elara's demonstration proves the shard's scientific purpose, achieving her goal while confronting the hollow cost of her past revolution—a Resonant Reconfiguration with unmistakable emotional price. The drive lens (causal) holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkages from dispute to demonstration to revelation. Minor deduction for dense worldbuilding that slightly delays full orientation clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting with its "crumbling corridors" and temporal storms directly constrains choices—the uncovered mirrors create danger that the shard resolves. Vivid sensory detail like "amber river" of visible time and "jagged rapids" during storms. The setting's decay mirrors Elara's emotional state while the temporal storm forces the decisive demonstration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from ideological dispute to preventing renewed civil war, with the temporal storm creating immediate physical danger that forces action. Elara's agency drives the demonstration despite Varek's protests, and the cost lands viscerally—she proves her point but confronts that she "shattered the vase, and with it, the future." The tightening from argument to demonstration to bitter victory works well under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mirror/shard demonstration: science versus dogma, the cost of revolutionary destruction, and wisdom lost through zealotry. The final image of Elara alone with the cold shard, "mourning a world she could never rebuild," offers a non-literal answer about irreversible loss. Strong integration of the mirror-covering ritual as both plot device and thematic vehicle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled elevated diction matching Elara's poetic nature ("baroque silence," "gilded ruins"). Some register drift into overly ornate phrasing ("burnished sorrow" appears twice) that occasionally obscures immediacy. Varek's dialogue effectively contrasts with narrative voice, carrying subtext about ideological rigidity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some ornate constructions slow momentum ("a slow, amber river now flowing through the baroque asteroid's crumbling corridors"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deduction for repeated "burnished sorrow" phrase and occasional overwriting in descriptive passages that don't directly serve the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time visibility, archaeological disputes, and mirror rituals creates an original premise. The twist that mirrors need protection from time rather than hiding from it subverts expectation effectively. The specific detail of the Chronos Event and temporal storms elevates beyond generic post-apocalyptic settings.</comment>
