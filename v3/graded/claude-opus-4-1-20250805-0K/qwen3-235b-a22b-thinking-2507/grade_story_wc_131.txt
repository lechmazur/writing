<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied details (calloused fingertips, sense memory of grandfather) and drives a specific choice with visible cost—she gives up the tape rather than keeping it for herself. The internal contradiction between invisibility and the need to be seen plays out through concrete action, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("quiet, persistent need").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's visibility achieved through making others visible. The closure lands with felt cost (giving up the discovery) and conceptual repricing of what visibility means. Causality holds throughout, though the tape's presence in the pipes relies on slight convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting functions beyond description—the pipe chase both conceals Elara and enables her discovery, while the sapphire dawn light creates atmospheric coherence. The library's architecture (service tunnels, rare books section) constrains movement and shapes choices. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, though some passages lean descriptive without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal need (visibility) through discovery to moral choice (helping Mrs. Gable), with clear cost when Elara surrenders the tape. The dominant stake is well-signaled and tightens through the decision to give rather than keep. Pressure builds appropriately under the textural lens, though the conflict lacks active opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between Elara's invisibility and the hidden tape—both vessels of memory seeking recognition. The final image resonantly answers the central question about visibility through giving rather than taking. Subtext operates cleanly through gesture and silence, particularly in Mrs. Gable's reaction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's custodial knowledge ("every groan of the aging building") and selective attention to infrastructure. Voice modulates with discovery, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("fragile, quiet light"). The POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance, but occasional filter constructions dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments of compression and rhythm variation, but repetitive use of "sapphire hush" (4 times) and some template cadence ("She knew... She wrote... She watched") create monotony. Information density is generally good with lines doing multiple jobs, though some descriptive passages could be tighter. The opening and closing images effectively bracket the piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crawl space dweller perspective offers a fresh angle on library life, and the connection between physical and emotional invisibility shows originality. The synthesis of personal memory with discovered artifact feels earned, though the setup (tape conveniently in pipes) edges toward convenience. The piece commits to its quiet register without retreating to false drama.</comment>
