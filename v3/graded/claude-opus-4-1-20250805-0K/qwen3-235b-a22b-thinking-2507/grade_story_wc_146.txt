I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through rhythmic repetition and pattern establishment rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through her methodical mapping of silence and patient demonstration of rhythm. The internal logic holds—she understands the town's collapse as rhythmic discord rather than mere physical decay. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of "resonance between land and people" which could use more visceral grounding in the early sections.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where collective walking creates alignment, with visible cost in the "fragile thread" and years of patient work ahead. The accumulative structure coheres as rhythmic patterns build from discord to tentative harmony. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by the archway description. The cost manifests in dust falling as "release" and stones settling into alignment—physical proof of change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The archway and cobblestones function as active constraints, with the tuning fork's resonance testing stone integrity. Excellent sensory hierarchy—Elara perceives through vibration and rhythm rather than sight. The setting actively shapes choices: "She needed the town's feet to speak again, to walk not just *on* the cobblestones, but *with* them." Physical space directs the solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize through the progression from solo listening to collective walking, with escalation in the residents' gradual synchronization. The dominant stake—restoring harmonic balance—faces concrete test when skeptical Tomas's heavy boots must find the rhythm. Cost appears in the "shower of dust" and stones settling, though the transformation could carry more visceral weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of footsteps as communal heartbeat. The final image of the tuning fork's note "blending with the rhythm of the returning town" offers resonant answer without stating a moral. Strong subtext in how different walking patterns (miners' urgent stamps, merchants' hurried pace) reflect social discord.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with consistent metaphorical register around vibration and resonance ("taut wire," "brittle pulse," "fractured foundations"). The prose maintains lyric control without head-hopping. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("syncopated beat of daily existence") that slightly exceeds the established voice's range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation, though some figurative density in early paragraphs ("bruised twilight sky," "skeletal remains," "grim portrait") clusters without full payoff. Template cadence appears briefly: "Miners had stamped... merchants hurried... children no longer skipped." Information density is high, with most sentences advancing both atmosphere and concept.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost town revival through sonic/rhythmic restoration rather than physical rebuilding. The specific solution—collective walking rhythm—feels non-obvious yet inevitable. The concept of towns having a "heartbeat" in their footfall patterns transforms the familiar ghost town trope through embodied, communal action.</comment>
