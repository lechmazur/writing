<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in professional duty, with concrete embodied details like the respirator fogging and the patch's cold weight. The internal conflict between scientific precision and human empathy plays out through micro-choices, particularly when she pockets the patch as both evidence and memorial. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("hazy precision wasn't just the atmosphere; it was her methodology") that feels too articulate mid-investigation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through wind measurements and vortex documentation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's promise to "make the invisible visible" crystallizes with felt cost. The closure lands with the patch as memorial and her vow to prevent future ghost towns, showing clear before/after in her stance. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The container labyrinth functions as active setting that constrains choices—the V-shaped epicenter creates the lethal vortex, containers shift overhead forcing Elara to dive. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (wind whistling through gaps, dust swirling in spirals) filtered through her investigator's priorities. The environment directly charges the final image of empty cranes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as wind readings intensify from 60 knots to the 10,000-pound force revelation, with the container's groan/shift forcing rapid adaptation. The dominant stake (preventing future disasters through understanding) tightens when she realizes "the labyrinth itself was a dynamic hazard." Cost is legible in the town's absence and the engineer's death.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between precision and chaos, with "singular convergence" serving as both technical term and metaphor for uncontrollable forces meeting human systems. The patch transforms from evidence to memorial, and the final promise to "make the invisible visible" offers a non-literal answer to how we confront disaster. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit "her work was a vow" that edges toward stating theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains technical precision appropriate to an investigator while modulating with emotional intensity ("the town's absence like a physical ache"). The perceptual signature is distinct—she notices fractures, pressure gradients, wind patterns others would miss. No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice remains consistent even under the stress of the falling container.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the respirator establishes both setting toxicity and her professional preparedness). Some template cadence appears mid-story ("She noted...She documented...She thought") and minor paraphrase loops around wind measurement descriptions. The opening and closing lines effectively bracket the piece with voice and resonant image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The container port as wind-tunnel death trap offers a fresh angle on disaster investigation, with specific technical details (microbursts, pressure gradients) grounding the premise. The synthesis of meteorology and human tragedy feels earned, though the investigator-arrives-at-disaster-site frame is somewhat familiar. The specific physics of container geometry creating lethal vortices provides genuine originality.</comment>
