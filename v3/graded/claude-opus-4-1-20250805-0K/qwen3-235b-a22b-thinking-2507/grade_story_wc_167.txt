<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal conflict between hollow spectacle and meaningful craft drives authentic tension through embodied details like "hands, usually steady with lead came and silver solder, felt restless." The transformation from seeking to understanding value in mundane repair work is earned through the stone-throwing ritual, though the epiphany edges toward over-articulation in places.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens builds through the stone's ripples expanding into interconnected patterns that mirror Elias's glazier work, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where he understands his "true work" with visible cost (returning to waiting commissions). The closure lands cleanly with "ready to find the extraordinary glow within the next pane of cracked glass," though orientation anchors arrive slightly late (harbor glazier role at ~60 words).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prism atrium and pond function as micro-settings that constrain and enable Elias's revelation—the rings' physics become the mechanism for understanding interconnection. Vivid sensory work like "frost-locked gravel" and "water's obsidian surface" creates lived-in specificity, with the environment actively shaping the final insight about finding "radiance within the repair."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of finding authentic value escalates through the stone-throwing ritual as ripples reveal deeper patterns of interconnection, narrowing from abstract seeking to concrete understanding. Cost manifests in returning to "hollow" commissions with transformed perspective, though the conflict remains primarily internal without external pressure testing the revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the ripple patterns teaching interconnection—"how a single crack in a lighthouse pane could compromise the beam guiding ships." The final image of finding "extraordinary glow within the next pane of cracked glass" offers a non-literal answer to the value question, though some passages like "vast, intricate network of cause and effect" edge toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Elias's glazier lens—"reading between the lines of cracked glass" and seeing "stress fractures, hidden flaws." The prose modulates effectively from contemplative observation to crystallized understanding, though occasional register elevation ("noctilucent reckonings") slightly strains the working-class POV's natural lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information-dense prose like "concentric rings erupted, flawless circles expanding across the pond's dark mirror" advances multiple layers simultaneously. Some overwriting appears in passages like "vast, intricate network of cause and effect, beauty born from tension and repair," creating mild density issues, and "noctilucent reckonings" reads as thesaurus-inflated for this POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The glazier-as-philosopher angle offers fresh specificity, with the stone-throwing ritual as divination feeling earned through craft metaphors. The synthesis of manual labor and metaphysical insight avoids cliché, though the resolution toward finding value in mundane work follows a somewhat familiar arc.</comment>
