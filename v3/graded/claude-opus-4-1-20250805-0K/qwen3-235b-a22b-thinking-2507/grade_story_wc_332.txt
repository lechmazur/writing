<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is crystal clear—finding her sister through the watercolor cipher—and her obsessive dawn ritual embodies this drive viscerally. The contradiction between hope and absence pulses throughout, particularly in "fossilized tears" and the palette as both gift and haunting reminder. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("cipher of longing") that could be more embodied, though the final choice to pursue the lead carries genuine cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage: discovery of light-activated messages leads to methodical photography, which reveals coordinates, culminating in decisive action. The closure (Decisive Change) lands with clear cost—Elara abandons her library post to pursue an uncertain lead. The "luminous absence" transforms from emptiness to "canvas waiting for the right light," achieving resonant reconfiguration. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the archipelago's geography.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Sea-Whisper Library with coral windows and salt-bleached maps creates vivid specificity, while the tide-locked causeway provides a natural time constraint. The watercolor palette functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's method of discovery. Deduction for some abstract geographical markers ("scattered like broken teeth") that don't fully anchor spatial relationships between islands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly: from futile color-matching attempts through the breakthrough discovery to the final solstice photograph revealing recent coordinates. The dominant stake (finding the sister) tightens through each photographic revelation, with visible cost in Elara's years of isolation. The tide's daily rhythm creates natural pressure. Minor deduction as the middle section could compress slightly without losing escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The central theme—absence as presence requiring the right illumination—emerges organically through the light/pigment discovery. The transformation from "luminous absence" to "canvas waiting for the right light" offers genuine resonance without stating a moral. The story earns its insight about perception and patience through concrete action rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("dusted moonlight from ledger pages") and selective perception focused on light, color, and maritime details. Some register elevation feels slightly forced ("vitalize the cipher"), and occasional abstract phrasing ("cipher of longing") doesn't fully match Elara's otherwise concrete observations. The darkroom sequence effectively modulates rhythm to match discovery tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some figurative density feels overwrought ("islands scattered like broken teeth"). Template cadence appears in the photography sequence ("She'd capture...She'd photograph"). The word "vitalize" appears twice unnaturally. Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple story elements simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of messages hidden in refracted light rather than pigment itself is genuinely fresh. The synthesis of maritime setting, photography, and sisterly devotion creates a unique emotional texture. The story transforms the "missing person" trope through its specific mechanism of discovery and the poetic treatment of absence as presence.</comment>
