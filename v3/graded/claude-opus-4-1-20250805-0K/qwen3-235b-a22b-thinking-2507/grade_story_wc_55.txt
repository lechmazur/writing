<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal journey from pursuing mechanical perfection to accepting imperfection is earned through the bear encounter, with contradictory impulses (fear vs. recognition) acting simultaneously. The "excruciatingly gentle" movements and abandoned dream create consistent motivation. Deduction for slightly abstract epiphany language ("mistaken its purpose") that could be more embodied in the peak realization moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias reconceptualizes his abandoned dream from failure to ongoing journey, with visible emotional cost in "the abandoned dream resting lightly now." The bear encounter causally triggers this shift. Accumulative/textural lens holds through density of sensory detail and cadence shifts. Minor deduction for cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sanctuary setting actively constrains through "glacial hush" and crystalline surfaces that enforce gentle movements. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (petrichor nostalgia, crystal forecourt). The bear's presence transforms the space from empty to "held note," directly charging the final realization.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reconciling with abandoned perfection) escalates through the bear's arrival, forcing Elias from routine maintenance into existential confrontation. The "glacial hush" deepens from emptiness to "held note" to inner warmth. Cost is visible in accepting imperfection "as part of the design," though the resolution feels slightly too neat for the setup's weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bear's simple being versus Elias's pursuit of "mechanical perfection," with the final image of "silent clocks" and "hidden sunrise" offering non-literal resolution. The petrichor nostalgia transforms from weight to "gentle breath." Minor deduction for the slightly explicit thematic articulation "mistaken its purpose" that edges toward stating rather than showing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through clock-specific observations and "excruciatingly gentle" repetition that creates voice texture. Strong control of psychic distance during the bear encounter. Deduction for occasional register drift into elevated diction ("profound, quiet assertion of being") that doesn't fully match Elias's established interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and sensory density. However, "excruciatingly gentle" appears four times creating template cadence (-0.6), "glacial hush" five times borders on repetitive (-0.4), and some elevated register drift in peak moments ("profound, quiet assertion"). The sanctuary descriptors cycle through similar phrases. Information density is high but marred by these pattern artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bear as fellow sanctuary inhabitant rather than threat offers a fresh angle on epiphany stories. The specific synthesis of clockwork precision with natural presence feels earned. However, the abandoned dream arc follows familiar "perfectionism to acceptance" templates without sufficient transformation through lived detail to fully escape the pattern.</comment>
