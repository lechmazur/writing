I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and memory toward a resonant reconfiguration of grief's shape.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas's grief manifests through embodied contradictions—limestone dust on skin while tears finally fall, the "fiercely meditative rhythm" of breathing against loss. His transformation from seeking "individual sorrow" to understanding "collective grief" earns its cost through the ribbons ritual and spectral guidance. Minor deduction for Corvin's slightly abstract coaching about "the space between."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from solitary tracing to collective understanding, with the monarchs' transformation from "burnt-orange embers" to living vessel providing the resonant reconfiguration. The closure—"finally tracing the true shape of home"—lands with felt cost through tears and transformed understanding. Orientation anchors clearly (greenhouse, dusk, Silas as carver), and the spectral element integrates seamlessly into the grief exploration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as more than setting—its "iron bones straining under decades of ivy and memory" mirrors Silas's grief architecture, while the monarchs create a "living mosaic" that physically manifests collective mourning. The ribbons tied to specific plants (fig tree, fountain, propagating case) map emotional geography. Environment directly shapes the final realization about grief as "ancient, sheltering, transformed."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation accumulates through textural deepening: from individual tracing to ribbon-tying to monarchs reconfiguring into "a bowl, cupping the space where his family once sat." The dominant stake—understanding grief's true shape—tightens as Silas moves from stone-carver's solitary craft to accepting collective memory. Cost manifests in the first tears since the funeral, though Corvin's arrival feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the contrast between permanent stone and migrating butterflies, individual epitaphs versus collective memory. The final image of grief as "the greenhouse itself, ancient, sheltering, transformed by what it held" offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior material. The ribbons' transformation from dinner ritual to memorial practice deepens without stating its meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV maintains Silas's craftsman perception throughout—"limestone grit," "transfer epitaphs onto cold granite," "the same technique." The spectral dialogue carries appropriate otherworldly register ("too heavy with the stone"). Perceptual signature strong in how Silas notices textures and techniques even in grief, though occasional elevation ("cathedral for the living and the lost") slightly exceeds his established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and careful rhythm modulation—short, sharp observations alternating with longer accumulative passages. Information density high throughout, with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor deductions for slight overwriting in places ("fiercely meditative" appears twice) and one instance of elevated diction ("cathedral for the living and the lost") that briefly breaks voice consistency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving craft with butterfly migration as grief metaphor feels fresh and earned. The spectral mentor teaching through environmental observation rather than direct instruction adds originality. The specific detail of ribbon-poems tied to greenhouse plants transforming into butterfly beacons shows genuine ingenuity in making the abstract concrete.</comment>
