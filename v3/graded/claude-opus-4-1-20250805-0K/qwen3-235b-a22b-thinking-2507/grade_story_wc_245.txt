<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's blindness and grief create genuine contradictory impulses—fighting versus accepting the current—that culminate in her earned realization that the stillpoint must be "forged in the act of seeking." The sensory-based navigation and emotional embodiment through ultrasonic vibrations absorbed through skin avoid stock phrasing. Minor deduction for the brother's convenient pre-death journal hints and the slightly rushed emotional resolution in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based progression (musical notes G-D-A-E-C-F forming the brother's lullaby) that achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara realizes the stillpoint exists within her. The constellation pause creates genuine time pressure, and the cost is felt in "the fierce, tender core where pain and peace coexisted." Slight deduction for the brother's overly convenient philosophical quote mid-story.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest functions as active setting through vibrations that translate into musical notes Elara absorbs through skin, constraining her navigation method and charging the final realization. Sensory hierarchy reflects her blindness with tactile/vibrational dominance. The platinum compass ring's dowsing ability and the engraved stones create tangible spatial choreography that shapes choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The constellation pause creates escalating time pressure ("Cassiopeia's throne began to tilt") that forces Elara to accelerate her search, with the dominant stake of finding peace with grief tested through physical and emotional obstacles. The cost lands when she must accept that healing requires active seeking rather than finding an external solution. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient discovery of the stone circle at the exact right moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete journey where each absorbed note "unraveled a layer of grief," culminating in the non-literal answer that the stillpoint is "forged in the act of seeking." The brother's lullaby as the hidden melody and the final image of Elara drawing "the uncharted terrain of healing" offer resonant closure. Slight deduction for the brother's overly articulate wisdom quote that borders on thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through ultrasonic absorption and tactile navigation maintains consistency, with syntax appropriately fragmenting under pressure ("She froze. The constellation pause was thinning"). The POV remains firmly anchored in Elara's blind perspective without leakage. Minor deduction for occasional filter phrases ("She understood now") that could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong sensory specificity and varied syntax, but several instances of elevated diction drift ("ceased to exist in conflict," "eternal shift") and filter constructions ("She understood now," "She focused on"). The "fierce, tender core" phrase and some abstract formulations in the final paragraph reduce immediacy. Information density remains high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest that communicates through musical notes absorbed through skin offers a fresh sensory angle on grief navigation. The synthesis of blindness, tactile mapmaking, and sonic wayfinding creates an organic whole. Transformation of the quest narrative through sensory substitution and the "stillpoint within" reversal avoid template resolution.</comment>
