<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal contradiction between rigid protocol adherence and the need for vulnerability drives the closure choice effectively. The "operatively gentle" restraint and ritual grounding create embodied specificity. Deduction for occasional diagnostic language ("exhaustion of decades," "ghosts of countless failed talks") that could be more embodied, though the final choice to admit culpability lands with clear cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens coheres through ritual repetition, sensory layering, and the final reconfiguration where Elara's admission creates "the possibility of trust." The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (political suicide, public censure). Minor deduction for slight orientation delay and some backstory density, though both serve the accumulative pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The terrace functions as more than backdrop—its "flawed beauty" mirrors the negotiation's fragility and constrains the encounter spatially. Strong sensory hierarchy through heat, worn stones, scarred valley vista. Deduction for some generic descriptors ("ancient," "centuries of sun and sorrow") and because the setting doesn't quite reach the level of constraining choice required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preventing violence through admission of fault) escalates from accusation through Elara's vulnerable admission to Kael's conditional engagement. The "operatively gentle" approach creates coherent pressure under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible ("political suicide"), though the single-beat escalation limits the upper range.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete tension between "ideals" and "practice," embodied in Elara's ritual preparation versus her necessary vulnerability. The ebony clipboard as "testament to process" and the terrace's flawed beauty create resonant particulars. Slight deduction for the explicit thematic statement about "ideal of peace... anchored in practice" that edges toward direct articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's ritualistic attention and professional framing ("forever war peace negotiator"). Dialogue carries appropriate subtext and goal-pursuit. Deduction for some register elevation in stress moments ("the slow dance of celestial bodies," "ash in her mouth") and filter-heavy passages that occasionally distance rather than immerse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Several overwrought metaphors ("ghosts of countless failed talks," "bloomed into fire") and template phrases ("weight familiar in her hands," "ash in her mouth") accumulate without touching closure directly. The prose maintains momentum but lacks the crystalline precision required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece transforms the negotiation trope through Elara's specific ritual grounding and willingness to accept "political suicide." The "operatively gentle" approach and the terrace's flawed beauty create memorable specificity. Limited by some familiar elements (scarred valley, enemy commander dynamic) that aren't fully transformed beyond their archetypal functions.</comment>
