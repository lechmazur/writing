<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaito's motivation is clear and rooted in his potter's understanding of persistence through fire, with concrete embodied details like "dusted with clay" and "breathing slow and deep." His internal conflict between witnessing and participating plays out through micro-choices (placing the stone offering, carrying the glass). The final choice to carry the fragment "not to fix it, but to hold its lesson" shows earned wisdom with visible cost—he accepts the weight of memory rather than attempting restoration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered time-images until the final Resonant Reconfiguration where Kaito understands kindness as phototropic persistence. The closure lands with conceptual cost—"not as a return, but as a possibility anchored in kindness"—though the physical cost could be more visceral. The fractured timeline device creates coherent pressure that forces Kaito's stance from observer to participant-witness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The wasteland setting actively constrains choices through "sun-baked earth" and "scorched" desolation, while the oasis's remnants (cracked clay hives, withered lavender, stone well) provide specific touchstones that enable discovery. The lantern glass functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kaito's potter-awareness: tactile details dominate ("weight of the potter's wheel," "warm against his palm"), and the single blooming lavender creates sharp contrast that matters to the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why places resist change—deepens through the glass discovery and vision sequence, with one meaningful tightening when Kaito shifts from seeking to participating through his stone offering. Cost becomes legible when he accepts carrying the fragment's weight "in his bones" rather than fixing it. The escalation follows the accumulative lens appropriately, though a sharper trade-off or more visceral price would strengthen the closure's impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of pottery—"shaped by intention, hardened by time"—without explicit moralizing. The phototropic quality of kindness develops through specific images (lantern glass warming, lavender blooming) rather than abstract statements. The final insight that kindness "refused to let darkness have the final word" reweights all prior wasteland imagery, though the "invisible hands" phrase edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains a meditative register appropriate to Kaito's zen potter perspective, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "slow and deep" and "sharp gentleness." The perceptual signature emphasizes tactile and thermal sensation ("dusted with clay," "faint warmth," "thrum vibrating up through his bones"). Some phrases like "phototropic to kindness" stretch credibility for the POV's naturalistic lexicon, creating minor register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful repetition of "thrum" as a binding element. Information density is high—most sentences advance both external discovery and internal realization. However, abstract phrases like "accumulated weight of kindness" and "phototropic and stubborn" create opacity in peak beats, and "invisible hands" in the penultimate paragraph dulls specificity where concrete imagery would strengthen impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of beekeeping, pottery, and temporal fracture creates a non-obvious meditation on persistence that feels earned through specific detail. The concept of kindness as "phototropic" light that bends time itself offers fresh insight. The risk of combining mystical time-fractures with grounded craft knowledge pays off, though some elements (the chimney smoke marker) feel more obligatory than organic.</comment>
