<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's root-bound state creates genuine physical and emotional constraint that drives every choice, with contradictory impulses (freedom vs. duty) acting simultaneously throughout. The final shift from bondage to communion is earned through her blood sacrifice and the covenant's reweaving, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("anxious elation" repeats as label).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (roots shift from chains to conduits) building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's relationship to bondage transforms into communion. Cost is visible through blood sacrifice and years of imprisonment, though the covenant mechanics could be more concrete. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt glade's scars and root-bindings directly constrain Elara's movement and choices throughout, with the maze clipping functioning as micro-setting that enables the final healing. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("cobalt grass in violet streaks"), though some descriptions lean abstract ("fractured light").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as Elara moves from examining scars to blood sacrifice to achieving the intersection of dreams, with each action narrowing her options. The roots' transformation from binding to lifting shows meaningful deepening, though the drone threat remains somewhat distant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the covenant's eclipse and restoration, with the maze clipping's transformation from memory to seed offering resonant answer to reconciling past and future. "Scars are maps to belonging" and the final image of kneeling in communion rather than bondage reweight all prior suffering without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct mythic-poetic voice with controlled rhythm and consistent focalization, though diction occasionally drifts elevated ("fractured light," "verdant harmony"). The perceptual signature of feeling vibrations through "root-tethered bones" is memorable and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without always advancing pressure ("dying star," "moth's wing"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("root-bound"/"roots coiled"/"roots slithered"), and "anxious elation" repeats as a label rather than embodied state.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The root-binding as physical manifestation of ancestral debt offers fresh angle on nature/technology conflict, with specific detail like "maze topiary clipping" as living contract. However, the future/past dichotomy and healing-through-sacrifice follow familiar fantasy patterns without significant transformation.</comment>
