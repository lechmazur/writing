<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—salvaging pure essence from wreckage—with concrete embodiment through her methodical dream analysis and physical interaction with the melted snow globe. The internal contradiction between her role as truth-exposer and her compassionate weaving of fractured narratives creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("unbroken essence") and the slightly convenient resolution of all dream fragments perfectly fitting together.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with closure as Conceptual Repricing—the melted snow globe transforms from broken relic to promise through accumulated dream fragments revealing the crew's fatal deception. The cost is legible: Captain Varga's pure memory preserved against the crew's collective shame. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by ~100 words with the glacier shrine setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine carved from ice with borrowed starlight creates a vivid micro-setting that constrains Elara's work—the "subzero stillness" and isolation enable her ghost-listening. Sensory details are selective and purposeful: the "cloudy amber tear" of the melted globe, candles that "never wavered," the glacier's "deep-throated song." The shrine functions as both laboratory and confessional, directly enabling the story's central action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing hidden truth versus preserving dignity—escalates through accumulating dream fragments that reveal deeper fractures (storm→structural fatigue→collective lie). The revelation about silencing Finn's warnings creates meaningful pressure that reweights earlier material. Cost is visible in Elara's frozen tears and the crew's "fatal deception," though the resolution feels slightly neat with all pieces fitting perfectly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of the melted snow globe—distortion preserving essence. The story explores truth versus compassion without moralizing, as Elara exposes secrets "not as condemnation, but as a plea for understanding." The final image of the globe as "promise" rather than broken relic offers resonant closure without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent POV. Strong perceptual signature in how Elara processes ghost whispers and dream fragments—"weaving truth carefully, thread by spectral thread." Prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in the revelation sequence. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("laboratory and confessional") that slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("steel coffin three hundred fathoms down") and good information density. However, some abstract phrasing weakens immediacy ("unbroken essence of those lost," "fractured narrative into something whole"). Minor template cadence in the dream sequence descriptions and occasional filter constructions ("Elara focused") that could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost whispering with dream analysis creates an original investigative method. The specific detail of analyzing "cameo appearances in strangers' dreams" transforms a familiar supernatural premise. The melted snow globe as both literal artifact and metaphor for preserved-but-distorted memory shows genuine ingenuity, though the resolution's tidiness prevents higher scoring.</comment>
