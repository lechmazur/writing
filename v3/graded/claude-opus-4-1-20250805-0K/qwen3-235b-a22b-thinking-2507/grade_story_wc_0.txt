Looking at this story through an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through layered observations about dust, decay, and gradual transformation rather than causal plot events.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's internal contradiction between seeking spectacle for her field versus recognizing truth in gradual transformation drives authentic tension. The final choice to embrace patience over drama lands with earned cost through her prior struggle. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("profound humility kindle within her") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure building from neutron star work through flood damage to dust observation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aris reframes her entire approach to science. The cost is legible in "the weight of forced narratives lifting" - she's abandoning the career path of sensationalism. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively constrains choice - its ruin forces Aris to work with dust and decay rather than pristine equipment. Sensory detail effectively filtered through scientific POV ("iridescent dust," "mud-caked benches"). The decaying orchid and dust patterns become micro-settings that shape her realization.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through textural deepening: from career frustration to seeking refuge to discovering meaning in dust patterns. The dominant stake (finding authentic scientific practice versus demanded spectacle) tightens when she realizes the dust mirrors neutron star physics. Cost visible in abandoning "grant committees and press releases."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between cosmic and microscopic decay without explicit moralizing. The butterfly dust transforms from "relic of loss" to "compass pointing toward patience" - a non-literal answer to the central question. The final image of the "storm-damaged world...not like an ending, but a necessary, ongoing adjustment" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct scientific voice with controlled academic register appropriate to POV. Strong perceptual signature in how Aris notices "radio signatures," "incremental build-up," "microscopic layers." Some register elevation in emotional peaks ("profound humility kindle") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good information density, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "slow, inevitable dance of gravity and decay" followed immediately by "quiet truth of gradual transformation"; "patient transformation" then "ongoing, patient transformation." Mixed metaphor with humility that "kindles" yet is "warm and steady." These artifacts don't touch closure but accumulate enough to limit the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics and botanical decay creates non-obvious parallels. The specific angle of a scientist finding her methodology in greenhouse ruins transforms familiar "scientist has epiphany" territory. Risk-taking in the extended single-scene meditation pays off, though doesn't quite reach exceptional originality.</comment>
