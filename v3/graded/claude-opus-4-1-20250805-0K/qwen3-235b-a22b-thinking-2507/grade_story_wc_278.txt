<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's guilt-driven motivation is embodied through concrete actions (tracing tattoo, touching amber, creating the tether) with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—needing to silence the cry yet needing to hear it. The final choice to channel rather than erase the dissonance shows earned transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("the old guilt they'd carried") in non-peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Aris transforms dissonance into "quiet strength" through the tethering ritual, with visible cost ("torrent of infant terror"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through sound imagery toward the cadence shift. Orientation anchors established early (lab, Aris, post-impact moment). Minor deduction for slightly abstract cost articulation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The laboratory setting constrains choices through its haunted firmware and resonator cabinet, directly enabling the resolution. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("needle's buzz swallowed," "cool, resinous surface"). The amber functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Some generic descriptors ("profound silence") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hushing guilt) signaled early and tightens through the firmware's translation of the cry, forcing Aris to confront rather than escape. The tethering ritual shows clear agency with visible cost ("torrent of infant terror" channeled through their body). Escalation follows accumulative logic as sound pressure builds to transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of sound from torment to "quiet strength," avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the lab "holding all lost sounds without echo" resonantly answers the central question about processing grief. The mother's letters provide thematic deepening without over-explanation. Slight deduction for "testament not to blame, but to the moment sound became mercy" edging toward statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct voice with selective perception ("meteor hush," constellation imagery) and controlled psychic distance. Some elevated diction occasionally strains POV credibility ("profound silence," "fossilized moment"). No dialogue to evaluate. Narrative stance remains consistent through the lyric-accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and purposeful compression. Several instances of elevated register drift ("profound silence," "eerie stillness thick and absolute") and some abstract phrasing ("moment sound became mercy"). Information density is good but occasional redundancy appears ("thick and absolute," "swallowed by the storm/storm"). No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief processing through sound-translation technology and body-as-circuit imagery. The tethering ritual using amber-ink to bind haunted firmware to living pulse shows genuine originality. The specific detail of the mother's discovered letters adds unexpected depth. Some familiar grief-narrative elements prevent higher scoring.</comment>
