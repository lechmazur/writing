I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens - the story builds through layered images (extinguished lamp, sea glass, stone cairns) and reflection toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara accepts the role of keeper through symbolic action rather than literal relighting.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes convincingly from childhood memory to present duty, with embodied details like "the luminescent ache settled in her chest." The internal conflict between preserving physical light versus preserving promise lands effectively. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("vessel for them") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's stone-stacking as new form of lighthouse-keeping, with visible cost in accepting the lamp cannot be relit. The accumulative structure coheres through recurring images (sea glass, letters, stones). Slight opacity in the anonymous letter chain's mechanics prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice beautifully - the seized lamp mechanism forces alternative action, the specific beach location enables the stone messages. "Salt-stung darkness" and "iron grating" create visceral atmosphere. The lighthouse functions as both physical and metaphorical space effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal memory to collective safety as "ships would drift toward the teeth of Blackrock Point." The pressure coheres through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the lens. Cost is visible in accepting the light's failure while maintaining the watch through alternative means.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "bottling safety" and the tension between physical and symbolic protection. The final image of Elara as "a lighthouse of the soul" resonates without stating a moral. The anonymous letter chain creates meaningful ambiguity about community and trust.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent melancholic register with distinctive phrases like "shattered dreams" and "luminescent ache." POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Some elevated diction ("reticent," "sentinel") occasionally strains against the maritime setting but serves the elegiac tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of beauty ("where dawn would eventually bleed through") but suffers from periodic overwriting - "haunted space," "silent echo," "fragile chain of trust" accumulate without always advancing pressure. Some paraphrase loops around the safety/protection concept. Line-level craft is competent but occasionally purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of stone cairns as maritime communication offers fresh specificity within the lighthouse keeper tradition. The anonymous letter chain adds intrigue though its mechanics remain somewhat opaque. The story commits to its melancholic register without retreating to easy resolution.</comment>
