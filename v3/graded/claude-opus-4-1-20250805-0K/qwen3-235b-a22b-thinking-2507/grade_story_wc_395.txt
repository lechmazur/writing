<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss, with her brother's disappearance driving every choice. The internal conflict between duty to Vance and need to find Leo creates genuine tension. However, Vance's characterization feels thin—his fear and complicity arrive too suddenly without sufficient groundwork, and the revelation "Leo..." lacks earned emotional weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages as Elara traces the numbers through the archive. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration—the truth about the archive's consuming nature is exposed, fundamentally changing Elara's understanding. However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral; "the void deepening" doesn't fully dramatize what Elara loses or risks in this moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The digital archive setting provides functional constraints that shape Elara's investigation through system partitions and deletion protocols. The mission patch serves as a tactile anchor that charges the final confrontation. However, the setting lacks sensory specificity beyond "sterile glow," and the physical space of the archive never constrains choices or creates spatial tension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal investigation to systemic conspiracy as Elara discovers the archive's true nature. The physical confrontation with Vance provides a concrete pressure point. However, the escalation feels rushed in the final third, and Vance's sudden appearance lacks the building tension that would make his intervention feel inevitable rather than convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of consumed memories versus deletion emerges organically through the investigation, with the numbers serving as both plot device and thematic motif. The final image of the archive "ready to swallow its next victim" resonates with the established pattern. However, Leo's warning fragments feel overly explicit ("The archive doesn't delete... it consumes memories"), reducing subtext to statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with appropriate technical vocabulary for a data specialist. Elara's perceptual focus on patterns and anomalies fits her role. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("digital echo," "silent accusation") that doesn't match the technical mindset, and dialogue lacks naturalistic rhythm, particularly Vance's abrupt "Focus on active data, Elara."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "deleted files weren't gone—they were shredded into fragments, scattered across the system" restates rather than advances. Template cadence appears in the fragment recovery sequence ("She found...," "She realized...," "She wrote..."). The metaphorical language ("digital heartbeat," "archive's hunger") occasionally muddles rather than clarifies the technical reality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of a data archive that consumes rather than deletes offers a fresh angle on digital horror. The integration of personal loss with systemic corruption creates organic complexity. However, the execution relies on familiar cyber-thriller beats, and the revelation scene with Vance follows predictable confrontation patterns without surprising transformation.</comment>
