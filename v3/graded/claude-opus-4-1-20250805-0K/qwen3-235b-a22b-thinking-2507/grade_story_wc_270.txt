<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's insurgent stance emerges through concrete action (unsealing the embryo against tradition) with embodied physical cost (tremors, kneeling on hot basalt). The plant-telepathy creates genuine internal conflict between preserving tradition and evolving it, culminating in a choice that forecloses the old path. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "implanted destiny" and occasional diagnostic language ("honor tradition by changing it").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change closure: Elara unseals the embryo, releasing a hybrid plant that transforms the reconstruction's trajectory. The cost is legible—she becomes "insurgent still" but "necessary," accepting social exile for ecological renewal. Causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkage from discovering the kite script to decoding to unsealing. Slight deduction for mild orientation delay around the prophecy's specifics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hot springs constrain action (heat intensifying as she wades deeper) and enable the resolution (amber softening through thermal energy). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—sulfur-scented breeze, milky blue water, steaming rock. The volcanic landscape mirrors the story's tension between destruction and renewal. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("gray reconstruction sky").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal defiance to ecological intervention as Elara moves from seeking clarity to actively unsealing the embryo. The tightening occurs when she discovers the kite's script can unlock the sealed destiny, forcing immediate choice. Cost is visible in her accepting the "insurgent" label while the land validates her as "necessary."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the hybrid plant—neither pure tradition nor complete abandonment but evolution. The final image of the growing shoot "already taller, stronger" resonates without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the plants' whispers and Elara's physical interaction with the landscape. Minor deduction for slight thematic echo in "honored tradition by changing it."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through plant-telepathy shapes how Elara experiences the world ("whispers forming like blooming flowers"). Voice modulates appropriately from contemplative to urgent during the unsealing. Some filter verb clusters ("she saw," "she felt") and occasional register drift into abstract conceptual language reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose generally propels with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good—most lines advance multiple story elements. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "implanted destiny" and "insurgent," some template cadence in middle sections ("She must... She poured... She carefully"), and occasional abstract flourishes that don't serve the POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plant-telepathy gift offers a fresh angle on ecological reconstruction narratives. The hybrid plant outcome subverts expected prophecy fulfillment. However, the core premise of tradition-versus-progress and the elder-defying protagonist follows familiar patterns without sufficient transformation through lived detail.</comment>
