<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to negotiate with her ghost-self is clear and embodied through concrete scavenging actions, with internal contradiction between erosion and resolve. The collecting of fragments shows micro-choices under pressure with visible cost. However, the ghost negotiation lacks dramatic weight—the exchange feels abstract rather than earned through prior causality, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragments build toward the ghost negotiation, with Resonant Reconfiguration landing when Elara accepts "some negotiations end in silence." The cost is felt through tears and "hollow certainty," though the ghost interaction could be more concrete. Who/where/when anchored early through "kinetic lagoon" and carousel remains.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lagoon's "fractured stillness" and suspended water create atmospheric pressure that shapes Elara's scavenging method. Sensory details like "boots crunched on glassy silt" and "waterlogged negatives" ground the surreal setting. The disposable camera wheel fragments constrain choices and charge the final negotiation, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through fragment accumulation (ninety-eight to hundred), with each discovery deepening Elara's regret. The final negotiation crystallizes her choice between holding on and letting go. However, the ghost encounter lacks concrete pressure—the "negotiation" happens without dramatized resistance or trade-offs, limiting the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through collected fragments revealing others' regrets that mirror Elara's own—"I traded my song for safety" echoes her choosing "survival over art." The ghost's "It only stops if you look away" reweights the carousel's stillness. The ending resists easy resolution, though the ghost interaction verges on abstract rather than earned wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through phrases like "kinetic lagoon" and "fractured stillness" creates lyric texture. POV remains stable with Elara's selective perception of fragments and ghosts. Some figurative density ("coiled like cold wire") enriches without overwhelming, though occasional elevated diction ("limbo between earth and heaven") slightly strains the scavenger perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and selective detail. Strong verb choices ("waded," "plucking," "coiled") drive action. Minor redundancies appear ("eroded"/"erosion," "fractured"/"fragments") but don't obscure closure. The final image of "waiting for the next scavenger" effectively recharges the cycle without explanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The surreal lagoon setting and fragment-collecting ritual offer fresh angles on memory and regret. The ghost negotiation subverts expected resolution—no redemption, only acceptance of silence. The carousel as time-capture device transforms a familiar object, though the execution occasionally relies on abstraction over grounded detail.</comment>
