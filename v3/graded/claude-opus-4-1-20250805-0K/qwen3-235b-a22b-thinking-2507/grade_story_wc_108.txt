<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in betrayal, with concrete internal conflict between fear and determination. The embodied aquaphobia ("river's memory still coiled in her gut") and micro-choices (filming despite shaking hands) reveal character under pressure. However, the epiphany about vulnerability as power feels slightly unearned given the swift resolution, and some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("weaponizing what Lena dismissed").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Decisive Change with Maya reclaiming agency by exposing Lena's sabotage, creating clear before/after. The causal chain from discovery to decryption to action holds well, with visible cost in confronting trauma. Minor deduction for the somewhat rushed resolution and the "You were always enough" whisper that feels externally imposed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The rusted library setting provides atmospheric framing and the cast functions as micro-setting constraining Maya's mobility. Sensory details like "gritty cast" and "moonlight pooled on cracked marble" are selective and purposeful. However, the library doesn't significantly pressure choices beyond providing a filming location, limiting its functional integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear dominant stake of exposing betrayal versus remaining silent, with escalation through the decryption discovery that transforms vulnerability into agency. The cost is legible in Maya's trembling confrontation of aquaphobia. The resolution feels slightly convenient with the quick pivot from discovery to broadcast without exploring intermediate obstacles.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as strength emerges organically through Maya's journey from "invisible shadow" to reclaimed agency. The final image of rebuilding "one adaptive step at a time" resonates without moralizing. Minor deduction for the slightly on-the-nose "vulnerability wasn't a cage; it was the key" and the whispered affirmation that edges toward explicit theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with distinctive voice in phrases like "skeletal metal shelves clawing" and character-specific perception of the cast's scribbles. Some register elevation in peak moments ("electric hum of reclaimed agency") that doesn't fully match the established voice. The seashell's whispered dialogue feels slightly artificial in its thematic convenience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is good in descriptive passages. However, several instances of elevated diction ("vise of her fear," "electric hum of reclaimed agency") and some redundancy in the final third ("strength began with courage to be seen broken" restates earlier insights) impact momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The combination of stunt double with aquaphobia facing water-based betrayal offers a fresh angle. The cipher decryption through a child's code adds specificity. However, the vulnerability-as-power transformation follows a somewhat predictable arc, and the resolution lacks the complexity that would elevate it further.</comment>
