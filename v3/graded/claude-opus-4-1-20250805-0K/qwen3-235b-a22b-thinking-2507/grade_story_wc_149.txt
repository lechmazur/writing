I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through lyric resonance and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the ghost's dissolution saves the orchard.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses act in scene—Silas both needs and dreads the ghost's help, knowing each use costs her essence. The ghost's motivation is elegantly complex: repaying a debt through "lovingly venomous" touch that heals and harms simultaneously. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("heart aching") rather than pure embodiment, but the final choice lands with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost's dissolution transforms the orchard from dormancy to vibrant life, with unmistakable cost in her vanishing. The accumulative structure builds through seasonal returns and resonant awakenings to this final sacrifice. Orientation anchors (greenhouse, Silas, winter night) establish by ~60 words. The carved stone bead persists as material proof of transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively constrains choices—plants die without resonance, frost threatens the heartseed trees. "Perpetual night pressed against the glass" creates atmospheric pressure throughout. The alchemical orchard's specific ecology (moon-blooms, nightshades, heartseed trees) shapes what's at stake. Setting could more directly guide the ghost's final choice, but the winter-cracked fields frame the interior sanctuary effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual plants to the orchard's eternal magic: "If they died, the orchard's magic would fade forever." The ghost's essence fraying with each use creates accumulating cost. The final resonance that saves everything while destroying her demonstrates clear trade-off. Pressure coheres through the pattern of diminishing returns—each healing costs more of her form.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "lovingly venomous grace"—salvation that requires sacrifice, debts that demand both healing and harm. The carved stone bead as final image reweights all prior awakenings as steps toward dissolution. "Mournful elation" captures the complex emotional truth without stating a moral. The piece resists simple redemption, embracing the permanence of certain costs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct narrative texture with controlled lyricism: "a flicker at the edge of the citrus grove, her form woven from ash and starlight." The ghost's dialogue is appropriately ethereal yet purposeful. Minor register elevation in places ("mournful elation in her eyes") but largely consistent with the greenhouse-keeper's perspective. Free indirect style handles the ghost's explanation cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery: "Light exploded from the roots, racing up the branches in liquid gold." Some figurative density in emotional beats ("heart aching," "tears freezing on his cheeks") and occasional abstract phrasing ("centuries of sorrow"). The final paragraph has slight redundancy between "mournful elation" appearing twice. Information density is high but could tighten emotional summaries.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ghost as debt-bound healer/destroyer offers a fresh angle on haunting stories. The alchemical greenhouse setting provides specific texture beyond generic fantasy. However, the past-life betrayal follows familiar patterns, and some emotional beats ("heart aching," "tears freezing") use expected imagery. The resonant awakening mechanism is distinctive but could push further into unexplored territory.</comment>
