I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This story operates under a **Causal** lens - each beat follows because/therefore logic as Aeon's manipulation of the storm and fragment leads to the spatial mutiny's resolution and his glimpse beyond goodbye.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aeon's immortal ennui and desperate motivation are well-established, with concrete embodiment ("sediment in bones"). His choice to sacrifice the fragment shows genuine cost and earned transformation. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around dimensional awareness that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal closure where Aeon's sacrifice of the fragment resolves the mutiny and grants him the answer he sought - goodbye as membrane, not wall. The cost (losing his only tether to meaning) is explicit. The twist that the fragment orchestrated the mutiny adds depth to the causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The escondite's crystalline walls and dimensional fractures constrain Aeon's navigation and enable the story's resolution. Vivid sensory work ("liquid starlight," "cooling glass"). Setting actively shapes choices as reality rebels against him.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through spatial mutiny intensifying from tremors to full vortex, forcing Aeon's sacrifice. The dominant stake (discovering what lies beyond goodbye) tightens as the fragment's hunger threatens total dissolution. Cost is legible in losing his "only tether to meaning."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of letting go to discover - Aeon must sacrifice his connection to find what he seeks. The membrane metaphor elegantly reframes goodbye. Slight deduction for the somewhat explicit "keys could cut both ways" metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled diction ("hushed thunder," "dimensional mutiny"). Some filter verb clusters ("he'd felt," "he saw") slightly dull immediacy in middle sections. Strong perceptual signature with immortal's long view of time.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Some redundancy in describing the fragment's properties across multiple beats. Minor template cadence in "He'd [verb]" constructions mid-story, though the closing sequence shows excellent control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh take on immortal ennui through the spatial mutiny concept and dimensional awareness. The idea of goodbye as membrane rather than ending offers genuine insight. The fragment's agency as orchestrator adds originality to what could have been a standard quest narrative.</comment>
