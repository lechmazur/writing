<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ms. Thorne's progression from seeking refuge to active intervention is well-motivated through concrete embodied moments (tracing the rosette, recognizing hatred as "cumulative weight of unspoken assumptions"). The shift from "expectantly resigned understanding" to purposeful action demonstrates clear internal conflict resolved through specific experience with the rosette's metaphor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the rosette's metaphor of "subtracting noise" accumulates through reflection, teaching moment, and final concert to create a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence becomes "rich with resonance." Cost is visible in "weeks passed across this fragile unlearning" and the students' "arduous" work, though the final transformation feels slightly rushed for the word count.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The velvet library's "autumnal gloom" and "traveled stillness" actively contrasts with the school's "volatile energy," providing both refuge and solution. The rosette functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its principle of "subtracting noise within the instrument's body" becomes the rehearsal method that transforms the choir.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal refuge-seeking to ensemble transformation through the rosette discovery that reframes the problem. The "weeks passed" summary dilutes immediate pressure, but cost appears in specific moments: Mateo seeing Aisha's "clenched jaw...as pain" shows genuine transformation earned through the silence exercise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rosette's principle—creating harmony "by subtracting noise"—elegantly unifies craft preservation with interpersonal healing without stating a moral. The final image of silence "rich with the resonance of voices finally heard" reweights the opening's "silence" from escape to active creation, though "vanishing arts" as literal theme statement in narration costs points.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with effective rhythm modulation ("Dust motes danced...illuminating shelves bowed under the weight"). Some register elevation feels unmotivated for a choir teacher's POV ("traveled stillness," "expectantly resigned"), and dialogue mechanics are absent where they could have grounded the conflict.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("shelves bowed under the weight of forgotten histories") but suffers from abstract telling ("the unlearning of hatred," "erosion of the shared language of empathy") and repetitive phrasing around the theme. The "weeks passed" summary and conceptual redundancy around noise/silence/harmony weakens momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rosette-as-metaphor for community healing through active listening offers a fresh angle on the ensemble-in-conflict trope. However, the execution relies on familiar workshop dynamics (closing eyes, identifying internal noise) and the transformation from bitter division to harmonious performance feels somewhat predetermined despite the specific details.</comment>
