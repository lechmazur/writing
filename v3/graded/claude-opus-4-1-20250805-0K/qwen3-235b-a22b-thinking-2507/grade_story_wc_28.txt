<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's gentle radicalism manifests through embodied contradiction—his "arms of steel" protecting fragile memories while his fingers trace fractures with tenderness. The retrocognitive vision creates genuine internal conflict between revealing dangerous truth and preserving simple narratives. His final choice to restore the plaza's name carries visible cost as he risks Council opposition, though the emotional progression could deepen further in the confrontation with Varr.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through mosaic fragments toward Resonant Reconfiguration when the tessera reveals the plaza's true name, forcing the Council to confront suppressed mercy. The cost manifests as social/political risk when Kael challenges the official narrative. Orientation anchors immediately (plaza, post-fire, Kael searching), and the retrocognitive mechanism pays off structurally as memory literally embedded in stone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shattered mosaic functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—Kael must physically piece together truth from fragments. "Ash-dusted plaza" and "shattered sky above, a jagged mosaic" create environmental mirroring of the broken narrative. The tessera's "cool ceramic biting his palm" grounds the retrocognitive trigger in tactile specificity, though some descriptive phrases like "paradox of warm coldness" feel slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from preserving memory to exposing dangerous truth that "disarms hatred but terrifies those building monuments." The tessera discovery deepens pressure by revealing soldiers' mercy contradicts the revenge narrative. Varr's arrival with demolition crews creates immediate physical threat to the truth, though the Council's capitulation happens somewhat quickly without extended resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "aberrant mercy"—compassion that destabilizes rather than heals because it complicates pure vengeance narratives. The plaza's true name "Rahma al-Nasr/Mercy's Victory" reweights the entire conflict without moralizing. The final image of Kael cradling memory "in arms of steel" while "ancient stones holding their breath" resonates without stating conclusions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register with controlled rhythm—"retrocognitively trapped" and "aberrant mercy" fit Kael's intellectual radical perspective. Some phrases strain ("paradox of warm coldness"), and Varr's dialogue feels slightly generic ("Still here, idealist?"). The perceptual signature of noticing architectural/historical details through touch stays consistent, though prose occasionally tips toward purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "tessera trembling in his grasp" and effective variation in sentence length. However, several overwrought phrases accumulate: "paradox of warm coldness," "jagged mosaic of cloud and ruin," and repetitive "shattered sky" imagery. Some scaffold phrases like "he understood now" and "driven by the vision" could be cut for momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of mercy-as-disruption rather than simple good/evil offers fresh angle on conquest narratives. Retrocognition through physical mosaic pieces creates original mechanism for revealing suppressed history. The specific detail of "Rahma al-Nasr" and the tessera-as-key device elevate beyond generic historical fiction, though the quick Council capitulation feels slightly convenient.</comment>
