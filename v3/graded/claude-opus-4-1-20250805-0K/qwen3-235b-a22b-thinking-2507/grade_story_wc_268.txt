<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong character work with Aris's weathered dignity and Elara's trembling courage earning their pivotal choices. The rune manifesting on Elara's palm feels motivated by her quest to find Aris's messages. Minor deduction for Varek's somewhat stock villainy ("resplendent in ermine and false humility") and his convenient immediate flight without deeper consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Causal lens with the celestial pause triggering the rune's revelation as promised. The closure lands with Elara's ascension and Varek's flight, showing visible cost in his empire's collapse. Deduction for the slightly mechanical resolution where Varek's decree simply dissolves without more textured consequence, and the cost to Elara herself remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The temple library setting actively constrains choices through hidden texts and the pedestal's ritual. Strong sensory work with dust motes, moonlight, and iron gall ink's oak-and-iron smell. The setting enables the confrontation and shapes tactics throughout, though some details trend toward fantasy convention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from protecting secrets to the rune's manifestation to Varek's confrontation. The celestial timing creates genuine pressure. However, Varek's threat dissipates too easily without real resistance, and the resolution lacks a harder-fought victory that would heighten the cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through the contrast of truth versus pretense, with the library as keeper of authentic knowledge. The iron gall ink's permanence versus Varek's dissolving decree creates resonant symbolism. The ending image of Aris returning to his shelves while dawn touches Elara's glowing palm effectively reweights the opening's solitary vigil.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited with clean focalization through Aris. Strong perceptual signature in how he "traces the spines of knowledge as if blessing each volume." Some elevated diction ("regally unpretentious," "sanctum") fits the fantasy register though occasionally feels performed rather than lived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Deductions for repetitive constructions ("Aris knelt," "Aris remained," "Aris returned," "Aris placed") and some purple moments ("empire of lies reduced to dust motes in moonlight"). The "witness" moment lands effectively despite surrounding flourishes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The twist of Elara as true heir subverts expectations adequately, and the iron gall ink method for leaving messages shows creativity. However, the setup follows familiar fantasy patterns of hidden heirs and ancient prophecies without sufficient transformation through lived detail.</comment>
