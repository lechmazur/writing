<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from dutiful servant to witness of "something vast and gentle" is earned through concrete discovery and embodied response ("throat tightened," "spirit unmoored"). The internal conflict between duty and curiosity drives genuine micro-choices, though the epiphany about joy/anguish edges toward therapeutic articulation in places.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as Elara's discoveries layer toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where she commits to seeking "scattered light" rather than duty alone. The cost is legible in her risk-taking with the steward and the foreclosed path of simple service, though the transformation could be more viscerally priced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire and crystalline elevator create atmospheric pressure while the scattered light becomes functionally essential for decoding. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("frost-rimed clouds," "prismatic shards"), though the observatory arrival feels slightly underdeveloped spatially.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tension builds through the elevator's ascent as time pressure meets discovery urgency, with each floor marking progression. The dominant stake of finding meaning in servitude deepens through Varek's entries, though the steward's "impatient frown" provides minimal external pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The joy/anguish paradox emerges organically through Varek's lived examples rather than assertion, with the final sky-as-promise image offering resonant non-literal answer. The mint rebellion and grandmother's snow birds ground the theme in particulars, avoiding sentimentality through specific cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elara's contemplative nature, with perceptual signature in how she notices light and texture. Some filter-heavy passages ("she realized," "she noticed") slightly dull immediacy, but rhythm effectively modulates with discovery beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("auroras danced like living silk") with varied syntax and purposeful paragraph structure. However, repetitive "she [verb]" constructions appear in clusters, and some passages loop concepts (anguish/joy restated multiple ways) without adding pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The goggles-as-decoder device freshly transforms the found diary trope, while the servant's elevation journey literalizes ascension metaphorically. Varek's garden in ice and the spire's transformation from port to tomb show specific imagination, though the joy/anguish wisdom feels somewhat familiar.</comment>
