I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and sensory detail toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara finds belonging through frequency/vibration rather than through causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete details like "calloused fingers" and her drone pilot expertise, with genuine internal conflict between searching for belonging and professional dissolution. The transformation from "perpetually surprised" pilot to someone who "belonged" lands with earned cost. However, the epiphany about belonging as frequency relies on abstract telling ("This was the frequency of belonging") rather than fully dramatized realization, and some emotional beats use label-speak ("achingly familiar").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands with Elara's transformation from searcher to "someone who belonged," with visible cost in her dissolved squadron and years of searching. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and imagery build toward the frequency revelation. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "frequency of belonging" concept that isn't fully dramatized through concrete action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choice through the astrolabe's cosmic timing requirement and the star trails that "only her drone-honed eyes could follow." Vivid sensory work like "air tasted of dust and longing" and "stones older than nations" creates atmosphere. The matrix chip functions as micro-setting that enables the climactic action. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("bruised twilight sky").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake of finding belonging escalates through the precise timing requirement when "star trails converged," creating genuine pressure. The cost is visible in Elara's years of searching and her dissolved squadron. However, the resolution relies heavily on the device working as hoped rather than Elara making a difficult choice between competing goods, limiting agency at the crucial moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the frequency metaphor and the commander's wisdom about belonging being "a frequency only the lost can hear." The final image of Elara walking "toward the horizon, the frequency humming in her blood" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. Slight deduction for the explicit thematic statement "This was the frequency of belonging" that tells rather than trusts the dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception fitting a drone pilot's precision ("track a sparrow's wingbeat from a kilometer up"). Free indirect style is clean and psychic distance modulates appropriately. However, some register drift into elevated literary diction ("bruised twilight," "fractured astrolabe") doesn't fully align with Elara's military background, and no dialogue limits voice distinction opportunities.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum. Strong moments like "stones older than nations" and the star trail descriptions. However, several instances of overwriting: "bruised twilight sky," mixed metaphor in "holding their breath" for arches, and the abstract "frequency of belonging" phrase repeated without variation. Some filter verbs ("felt," "realized") dull immediacy in key beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of belonging as a literal frequency one can tune into offers a fresh angle on the universal search for home. The synthesis of ancient astronomy with modern drone piloting creates specificity. However, the resolution follows expected patterns without significant surprise, and the "missing pieces" concept plays out conventionally with the chip fitting into the astrolabe.</comment>
