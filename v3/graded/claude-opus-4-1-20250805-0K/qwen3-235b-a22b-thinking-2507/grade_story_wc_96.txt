<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The monthly persona shift from trembling Scribe to bold Architect creates genuine internal contradiction acted in scene, with the final choice to scatter papers carrying visible risk. Motivation intensifies through Mateo's prison memory and the tin's hidden verses, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise—the Architect scattering blank papers crystallizes his shift from hidden poet to active recruiter, with clear cost in exposing himself to authorities hunting him. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as moonlight, rust, and verse fragments build toward this reconfiguration, though the prison backstory slightly dilutes present momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rusted library's skeletal shelves and moonlit transformation from tomb to "cradle for the impossible" actively shape the Architect's emergence and final action. Sensory detail filters through POV bias effectively—the "cold, flaking iron" and "wind-whipped plaza" ground the scene while the setting enables and witnesses his transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal survival through hidden verse-planting to public recruitment, with the Architect accepting increased exposure despite authorities hunting the "Penny Poet." The shift from hiding verses to scattering blank papers meaningfully tightens risk, though middle development could sharpen the cost of this choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image of "rust remembers iron; the broken remember song"—beauty forged from institutional decay without explicit moralizing. The final scatter of papers offers a non-literal answer to resistance through art, though Mateo's "beauty from anarchy" line edges toward directness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through the vagrant poet's selective attention to decay and moonlight, with rhythmic control shifting from contemplative to urgent. The lyric compression and metaphoric density ("liquid silver," "luminous fracture") serve the Architect persona's emergence, maintaining coherence through pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks, with vivid specificity in "prison-issue spoon" and "chips of obsidian." Some figurative density in peak moments ("liquid silver," "skeletal shelves") and occasional filter constructions ("felt the familiar") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The monthly persona molt and false-bottom tin storing verse "seeds" offer fresh angles on resistance poetry, with the vagrant-as-camouflage adding specificity. The transformation from passive verse-hiding to active blank-paper scattering shows genuine risk-taking, though the prison-library friendship follows somewhat familiar patterns.</comment>
