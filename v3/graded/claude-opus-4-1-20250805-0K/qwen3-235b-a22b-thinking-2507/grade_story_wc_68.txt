<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Phil's motivation through rational preservation is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like "fingers raw" and specific actions with the chronometer cog. The confrontation with Kael tests his values under pressure, though the resolution lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate to higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis with Phil's continued preservation work despite opposition, showing visible cost through "agonizing spoonful at a time." The causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkages. Orientation anchors effectively establish the flooded sewer setting and post-Plague context early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sedimentary layers function as both literal setting and metaphorical constraint, directly shaping Phil's archaeological method and argument with Kael. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the tunnel confrontation. The chronometer cog serves as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image of preservation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of preserving rational knowledge versus accepting simplified myths is signaled early and tested through Kael's confrontation. Phil's agency drives the conflict through his choice to present evidence rather than plead. Cost is visible in isolation and physical toll, though the tightening could be more severe.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the competing narratives of collapse—Phil's evidence-based archaeology versus the surface dwellers' divine punishment myth. The sedimentary layers work as both literal and thematic device. The ending offers a non-literal answer through continued preservation, though it could push beyond the expected resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close third-person with clear perceptual signature in how Phil notices sediment composition and mechanical details. Dialogue effectively distinguishes Phil's measured logic from Kael's dismissive tone. Some filter verb accumulation ("Phil saw the flicker") and repetitive phrasing around "rationally rebellious" prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose generally clear with good information density, particularly in the sediment layer descriptions doing multiple jobs. Template cadence appears in "He'd scribble...They spoke...Phil knew" sequence. Several paraphrase loops around the "competing narratives" concept and some filter verb stacks in emotional beats reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of archaeological preservation as rebellion against simplified narratives offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic settings. Specific details like using a rusted spoon for excavation and the chronometer's tide-calculating function elevate beyond generic ruins. The piece commits to its premise but doesn't take significant risks with form or perspective.</comment>
