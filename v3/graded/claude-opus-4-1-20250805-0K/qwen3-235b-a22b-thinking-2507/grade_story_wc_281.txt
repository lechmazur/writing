<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and grounded in professional failure turned scientific discovery, with embodied stress ("static shock still buzzed in Aris Thorne's molars"). The shift from "affectionate skeptic" to determined investigator feels earned through the somatic discovery. Minor deduction for Lena's underdeveloped role beyond supportive presence and for some diagnostic language ("somatic markers") that could be more embodied in the peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the shift from failed telepathy pills to understanding "the body's own fractally precise song," with visible cost in the recall and professional failure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and scientific insights build toward the light-painting revelation. Orientation is clear by ~100 words. The cost is felt through tears and "fragile beauty" but could be more concrete in terms of what's lost or sacrificed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The light painting studio functions as both setting and instrument, with the muscovite sliver acting as a "fractal lens" that enables the discovery. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("residual ozone haze," "cool, paper-thin muscovite"). The environment directly shapes the solution through the LED projectors and sensor array, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional failure (recall notice) through scientific discovery (somatic echoes) to collaborative breakthrough (visualizing body's language). The dominant stake—understanding what went wrong to find a new path—tightens as Aris moves from passive receipt of failure to active experimentation. Cost is visible in the "irreversible empathic bleed" and professional indictment, though the final breakthrough lacks immediate trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between forced connection (telepathy pills) and natural communication (somatic markers as "the body's silent, intricate language"). The muscovite's fractal patterns become a non-literal answer to understanding human connection. The ending avoids moralizing while offering resonance through "understanding, illuminated not by forced connection, but by the body's own fractally precise song."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains scientific precision mixed with poetic observation ("willowglass hope," "fractally precise paths"). POV remains stable with Aris as focalizer, though some passages drift toward omniscient summary ("Lena, his lab assistant and the studio's true heart"). Dialogue feels natural with subtext ("Still wrestling ghosts, Doctor Skeptic?"). Minor register drift in peak moments with academic terminology.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the opening. Some overwriting in figurative language ("dust motes danced," "ghostly trails," "prismatic shards") clusters without clear pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears briefly ("He closed his eyes... Lena mirrored him"). The final image lands cleanly despite these minor frictions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of neuroscience failure with light-painting art to visualize somatic communication offers genuine freshness. The specific detail of using body signals as control mechanisms ("tightening a muscle to sharpen a beam") transforms the telepathy concept. Risk-taking in the technical-poetic fusion heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
