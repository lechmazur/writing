<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clearly rooted in redemption both professional and personal, with concrete embodied details like "the stone in his chest" and specific micro-choices under pressure. The internal contradiction between his burned status and desperate hope drives authentic tension. Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("fixing what's broken") and occasional emotional summary rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Story follows Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage from burned spy to microfilm to snow codes to satellite transmission to Mara's acceptance. Closure lands as Decisive Change when Mara accepts his vouchsafe and emerges from the mist, with visible cost in years of isolation paid. Minor deduction for slightly mechanical setup of the snow-code method and some expository weight in the middle section.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bluff setting directly constrains Elias's choice through the precise sun angle needed for transmission and the snow as medium for codes. Sensory details like "mist clinging to his coat" and "silver hush amplifying every crunch" are vivid and purposeful. The environment shapes tactics throughout, though some descriptive passages lean slightly generic ("snow-dusted pines").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redemption escalates from personal reflection to active code transmission to Mara's refusal to vouchsafe safety, forcing Elias to offer certainty instead of asking for trust. The reversal when Mara doubles the guard meaningfully tightens options. Cost is visible in three years of exile, though the final resolution arrives somewhat easily once Mara accepts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of "unused courage" emerges through concrete action—the courage to reach out and rebuild trust after betrayal. The pillbox functions as both practical tool and emotional anchor to his daughter. Some thematic statements feel slightly overt ("The broken thing isn't the mission. It's the belief that you're alone") but the final image of mending resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third with selective perception filtered through spy's trained observation ("the earth tilted toward spring"). Dialogue between Elias and Mara carries authentic subtext and advances plot. Minor issues with occasional register elevation that doesn't quite match character stress ("prudently daring his way back") and some filter-verb clustering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments like "mist clinging to his coat like a second skin" but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "fixing what's broken/shattered" (4+ instances) and some template constructions ("He thought of...He remembered...He keyed"). Information density is good in action sequences but thins during reflective passages. The paraphrase loop about broken things in the middle section dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The snow-as-transmission-medium offers a fresh angle on spy communication, and the personal stakes layered with professional redemption avoid pure genre exercise. The specific detail of the pillbox cipher and satellite timing feels inventive. However, the burned spy seeking redemption follows familiar territory without fully transforming the archetype.</comment>
