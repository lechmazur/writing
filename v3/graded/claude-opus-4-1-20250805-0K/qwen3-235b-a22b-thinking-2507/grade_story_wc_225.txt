<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal journey from guilt to self-forgiveness is earned through concrete discovery (the tapestry cipher revealing conspiracy), with embodied fidgeting and chess-trained pattern recognition driving authentic character work. The final choice to forgive herself rather than seek royal pardon shows genuine transformation with visible cost—she accepts her role while releasing undeserved shame.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based revelation building to Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's reframing from sole culprit to manipulated pawn. Cost is legible in "whispered an apology not to the crown, but to her younger self" and the choice to walk beyond seeking external absolution. Minor density issues in middle exposition slightly dilute momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth functions as micro-setting, its mirrored corridors revealing the conspiracy and constraining Elara's perception throughout. Time-frozen village creates palpable pressure through "woven hush" pressing like physical weight, while the tapestry's frayed threads become tactile tools for discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen as Elara winnows threads from ornamental damage to deliberate cipher to conspiracy proof, each discovery narrowing her emotional options. The thunder's progression from lull to crack to steady rain marks escalation, though middle sections could tighten for stronger pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tapestry metaphor—truth hidden in apparent decay, patterns visible only to trained eyes. The labyrinth transforms from "symbol of exile" to "compass recalibrating her soul," earning its resonance through concrete discovery rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature through chess-tutor lens ("trained to spot patterns in chaos") and distinctive syntax in peak moments. Some register elevation in middle passages ("chronomancy," "benediction") slightly strains the established voice without clear purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("fidgeted productively," "fierce repose"), but synonym loops appear ("frayed threads"/"frayed strand," multiple "winnow" uses). Template cadence in "She recalled...Yet here...The frayed threads confirmed it" sequence dulls momentum without taught pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess strategy with curse-breaking through pattern recognition in textile, avoiding generic redemption arc. The specific detail of court spies tampering with the board transforms the exile premise, though some familiar beats (mentor's gift, hidden truth in artifact) prevent higher scoring.</comment>
