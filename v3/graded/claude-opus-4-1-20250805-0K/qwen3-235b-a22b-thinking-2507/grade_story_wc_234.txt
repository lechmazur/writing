I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds density through layered imagery and metaphor toward Elara's internal shift about presence and capture.

<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from seeking to capture presence to accepting its ephemerality is well-motivated through embodied struggle with the vials and shell. The moment "She saw her error: she sought to preserve the pain, not the connection it revealed" earns the shift. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("density of presence") that occasionally replaces embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara revalues her alchemical practice, choosing presence over capture with visible cost (leaving without the preserved moment she sought). The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and metaphors build toward this repricing. Orientation anchors (Elara, ember nexus, twilight) establish cleanly within first sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ember nexus setting actively shapes choices - its natural radiance becomes the alternative to artificial pocket-suns, and the warm obsidian provides the intimate space for revelation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("cinders glowed beneath boots," "geothermal sighs"). The nautilus shell's geometry meaningfully mirrors the caldera's spiral collapse.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael's revelation ("I'm leaving... seasons, not years") provides the pressure that forces Elara's choice between capture and presence. The failed attempt to bottle his truth with the pocket-sun creates genuine stakes. Cost is visible in what she abandons (her alchemical mission) for what she gains (authentic connection).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete struggle between preservation and presence. The nautilus shell's "logarithmic curve" echoing the caldera's collapse creates resonant imagery without forcing symbolism. Final image of carrying "ember-heart within them" reweights the opening's external fire as internal warmth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends scientific precision ("logarithmic curve," "columella curl") with poetic observation ("twilight bleeding into volcanic caldera"). Dialogue is minimal but effective - Kael's whispered revelation carries authentic weight. Some elevated diction ("liminal power") occasionally strains but mostly serves the alchemist's perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("pocket-suns could freeze light, but could they trap this raw, fleeting essence?"). However, abstract phrases like "density of presence" and "palette of resolve" appear repeatedly without sufficient grounding. Some redundancy in explaining Elara's realization reduces momentum in the transformation beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The pocket-sun alchemist concept offers fresh specificity, and the tension between scientific capture and emotional presence provides non-obvious conflict. The nautilus shell as precision instrument turned emotional anchor shows creative integration. Story avoids easy resolution, choosing connection over preservation.</comment>
