Looking at this story through a demanding editorial lens, I'll evaluate it under an **Accumulative/Textural** drive lens, as the piece builds through sensory accumulation (scent, touch, memory) toward a resonant reconfiguration where whispered intent achieves what shouting could not.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is grounded in concrete particulars—his aching throat from failed shouting, Mara's fevered wisdom, the vial from his mother's garden. The internal contradiction between his "fool's hope" and fierce belief drives authentic tension, though the emotional resolution feels slightly rushed after the ship's salvation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration: scent-as-whisper saves the ship, proving Mara's lesson about whispered intentions. The cost is visible in Eli's tears and exhaustion, and the final line "The lighthouse stood sentinel... by the pure, unshouted will" crystallizes the thematic shift effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, fog, and vial create a lived-in sensory world that constrains choice—the dead foghorn and warped lens force Eli's unconventional method. The scent descriptions ("midnight violets," "jasmine and damp earth") are specific and purposeful, directly enabling the story's central action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (saving the Marigold) escalates from visual sighting to the desperate release of scent, with clear cost in Eli's emotional investment. The pressure coheres well under the accumulative lens, though the ship's response feels slightly convenient despite the mystical setup.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of "whispered power over shouted force" emerges organically through concrete action, not statement. The final image of the lighthouse keeping watch through "unshouted will" offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior material, especially Mara's fevered wisdom becoming truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with controlled rhythm ("cobalt lighthouse stood shivering," "screaming tenderness"). The perceptual signature is distinct—Eli notices scent, vibration, and texture over visual detail, fitting his character's belief system.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the deep exhale of the world returning to itself"), but some overwriting appears in peak beats ("fierce, almost violent love that demanded silence"). Minor repetition of "whisper" concept and occasional elevated diction ("tyranny," "herald") that slightly strains the voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of scent-as-navigation freshly transforms the lighthouse keeper trope. The specific synthesis of perfume-making heritage with maritime rescue feels non-obvious, though the mystical element of thought-transmission is somewhat familiar in speculative fiction.</comment>
