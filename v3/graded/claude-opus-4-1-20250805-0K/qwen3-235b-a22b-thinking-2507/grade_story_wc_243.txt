<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve memory is clear and embodied through concrete actions like grinding walnut ink and pressing flowers, with internal conflict between grief and joy crystallizing in the transmission to the teenager. The final choice to hand over the vellum shows earned agency with visible cost. Deduction for some abstract phrasing ("haunted euphoria," "regenerated covenant") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered preservation acts building to the resonant reconfiguration when Elara passes the vellum to the teenager, creating continuity despite demolition. Cost is visible in the "sharp grief" and the jetty's imminent destruction. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (jetty's demolition context arrives late in paragraph one).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming jetty with lupines and sea pinks growing through cracked planks creates vivid setting that constrains choice (demolition at dawn) and charges the final image through the parallel between mother's photo and present moment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (walnut-stained fingers, salt-rotted timbers, perfume mingling with brine).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal preservation to communal transmission when the teenagers appear, with Elara's choice to share the locket photo and vellum foreclosing her private grief for public continuity. The dominant stake (preserving memory before demolition) tightens through time pressure and deepens when the girl's understanding creates "proximate cause of continuity."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of preservation—pressed flowers as "threads in the regenerated covenant"—without overt moralizing. The final image of the girl tucking the vellum away while "endings were never absolute, only transitions" offers resonant answer to loss through transmission. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("regenerated covenant") that borders on theme-statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm and selective perception (walnut ink as "earth-born constellations"), though occasionally drifts into elevated diction that strains POV credibility ("proximate causes," "regenerated covenant"). Dialogue is minimal but functional ("Your grandmothers stood here"). Deduction for register inconsistency in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("walnut ink staining her fingertips like earth-born constellations") but suffers from abstract terminology loops ("proximate causes" appears 4 times, "regenerated covenant" 3 times) and occasional overwriting in figurative density. Information density is high but clarity occasionally obscured by elevated diction. Template cadence in some descriptive passages ("She carried... She reached... She opened...").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist preserving ephemera offers fresh angle on memory and loss, with specific details (ticket stubs, grocery lists transformed to permanent records). The parallel between mother's photo and present moment creates organic resonance. Deduction for some derivative elements in the memory-preservation theme and occasional retreat to abstraction.</comment>
