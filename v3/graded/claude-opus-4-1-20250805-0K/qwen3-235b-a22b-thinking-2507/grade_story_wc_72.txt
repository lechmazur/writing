<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aelius's transformation from rigid belief to welcoming nuance is earned through concrete discovery, with contradictory impulses (sorrow vs. judgment) acting simultaneously. The stone form constraining then enabling action creates embodied tension. Loses points for some diagnostic language ("incisively kind nature") and the convenience of his telepathic abilities expanding precisely when needed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Aelius moves from certainty to nuance, with visible cost in the "sorrow for the nuance they'd all rejected." The causal chain from ampoule discovery through revelation to healing action is solid. The lens reads as Causal with clear because/therefore linkages. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of telepathic restoration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater garden setting directly constrains movement and shapes the solution—the thread must navigate water currents and coral growth. Vivid sensory work with bioluminescent kelp and silt clouds. The Sundial Arch's structural weakness becomes the site of healing, making environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal awakening through historical revelation to structural healing, with each discovery narrowing Aelius's options toward the threading solution. The cost is legible in accepting uncertainty over rigid belief. The dominant stake of truth versus certainty coheres throughout, though the physical repair feels slightly detached from the thematic conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between rigid certainty (Council) and necessary nuance (geologists), culminating in "to welcome nuance into a certainty was the only path to healing." The ampoule transforms from truth-serum to healing thread, embodying the theme. The final image of the restored arch resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited with appropriate psychic distance for Aelius's stone consciousness. Strong perceptual signature in how his telepathy brushes minds and senses stone. Some elevated diction ("foxglove-stained glass ampoule") fits the mythic register. Minor deductions for occasional filter verbs and slightly formal narration that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple elements. Deductions for some overwrought phrases ("dissolved like the city's foundations"), repetitive "truth" constructions in the revelation sequence, and occasional template phrasing ("With infinite care"). No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Atlantis myth with geological reality and the truth-serum/healing thread transformation. The concept of a stone speaker awakening after centuries creates genuine novelty. The nuance-versus-certainty frame offers a non-obvious angle on the fall-of-civilization trope, though some elements feel slightly derivative of standard fantasy conventions.</comment>
