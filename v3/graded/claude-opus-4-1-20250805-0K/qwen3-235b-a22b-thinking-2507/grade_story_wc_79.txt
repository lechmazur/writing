<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's quietly driven nature manifests through precise, obsessive mapping of shell fractures—a concrete embodiment of his need to understand the watchers. His final choice to walk the map carries visible cost (abandoning safety for answers), and the contradiction between dread and resolve plays out in action rather than summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pattern density through shell fractures, wind paths, and lichen trails until the whistle's resonance reveals the hidden map—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights all prior mapping work. The cost is legible: Kael must follow the expedition's doomed path to the watchers, with "sunwashed dread intensifying" marking the felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city constrains every choice—Kael can only map on shell fragments, the whistle resonates specifically with shell geometry, and the revealed path is literally etched into the city's bones. The setting's unique properties (shell fractures, resonance patterns) are irreplaceable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from passive mapping to active discovery when the whistle reveals the hidden path, forcing Kael from observer to participant. The cost is clear: following the map means risking the expedition's fate, with "sunwashed dread pressing down like the weight of the turtle shells overhead" making the price visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of seeking dangerous knowledge emerges through the pattern language itself—the city guides seekers to the watchers through hidden maps. The final image of Kael carrying the whistle to "demand answers" resonates without moralizing, though the connection between pattern-seeking and fate could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Kael's cartographer's eye—he sees "fracture lines," "convergence points," and "pattern languages" where others see ruins. The prose rhythm tightens during discovery ("A sharp, clean crack split the air, not loud, but profound"), and specialized vocabulary remains consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("His hands, calloused and stained with ochre and ash, moved with quiet precision"). Some filter-verb clustering ("He believed," "He'd spent years") and occasional redundancy ("silent watchers" repeated) prevent higher scoring, but prose remains clean and propulsive overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a city's architecture encoding a fatal map through sound-activated resonance offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of cartography, acoustics, and ancient shells creates specificity, though the lost expedition trope itself is familiar.</comment>
