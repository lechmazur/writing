<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's methodical curiosity and perceptive nature drive concrete micro-choices throughout—clearing ivy with a soft brush, overlaying vellum maps, waiting for rain to test her theory. Her "shielded openness" manifests believably as skepticism paired with receptive patience. The emotional progression from analytical distance to tears of connection feels earned through accumulated discoveries rather than sudden epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered comparisons (1952 film/modern film/frescoes/maps) that reweight the chapel's silence into resonance. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as Elara physically reconnects the severed acoustic link, transforming from map-mender to bridge-builder. The "who/where/when" anchors clearly by ~100 words (Elara/fresco vault/rain).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The vault's fissure functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its blockage silences the chapel, its clearing enables resonance. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's professional priorities: light angles at 3:17pm, erosion isobars, fracture patterns. The henge stones singing through restored airflow charges the final image with environmental agency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative discovery: comparing films reveals light-shaft differences → cross-referencing maps shows sinkhole alignment → clearing the fissure tests the hypothesis → rain activates the resonance. The cost manifests as decades of silence now broken, with Elara carrying "the chapel's hum in her bones." One meaningful deepening that transforms understanding of the site.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "interpreting silence with empathy" isn't stated but enacted through patient observation and gentle restoration. The final note "Silence is not absence. It is a map waiting to be framed" reweights the entire investigation without moralizing. The chapel as resonance rather than building offers non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "cracked ochre pigments," "frame-to-frame" shifts, "diagonal shaft of light at precisely 3:17 p.m." Specialized lexicon (isobars, vellum, topographical) stays consistent with her map-framer expertise. Rhythmic control modulates from methodical observation to emotional release ("Tears mixed with rain").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density high—most sentences advance discovery or deepen atmosphere. Some figurative density in peak moments ("bled saints into ghosts," "monuments to division") but serves the accumulative texture. Minor repetition of "fresco" and "vault" but functions as anchoring. The phrase "methodically curious" appears twice, creating slight echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archaeological investigation through film comparison across decades to solve an acoustic mystery. The concept of a "whispered chapel" as harmonic resonance rather than structure offers non-obvious angle. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and specialized technical detail (Super 8 reels, isobars) heightens authenticity.</comment>
