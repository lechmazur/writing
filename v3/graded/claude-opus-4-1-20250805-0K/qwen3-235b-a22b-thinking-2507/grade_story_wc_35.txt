<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "sandpaper rough memories" drives consistent choices through touch-based discovery and culinary transformation, with contradictory impulses (flee vs. confront) acting simultaneously when she chooses to press both hands to the pavilion. The final transformation of personal remorse into communal release shows earned change with visible cost, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("a chef's curse and gift").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through water→coral→broth progression, culminating in Resonant Reconfiguration where private remorse transforms to shared release with felt cost ("shoulders slumped with relief"). The pavilion discovery at midpoint tightens options effectively, and the cooking transformation provides decisive change, though the final two paragraphs slightly dilute impact with summary reflection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The desert fortress setting actively constrains and enables choices—rain creates the map, sand preserves the pavilion, kitchen enables transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("wet sandstone and something older, sharper"), with the coral's impossible frost beneath desert sun creating productive tension that charges the final image of "walls...brittle, yes, but also enduring."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal memory-smoothing to absorbing centuries of collective remorse, forcing the choice to "drown or distill" with clear cost. The transformation through cooking meaningfully tightens options and the communal sharing shows visible price paid, though the resolution feels slightly neat for the scale of absorbed suffering.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete transformation of stored remorse into shared release without moralizing, with the pavilion-as-crucible metaphor earning its resonance through dramatized cooking. The final image of walls "brittle, yes, but also enduring" offers a non-literal answer about grief's transformation, though "This was the work she'd crossed deserts for" edges toward thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through culinary lens ("tasted it instantly—a chef's curse and gift") with controlled modulation under pressure. Some register drift occurs ("subsume," "emotionally contagious") that doesn't fully match the embodied, sensory voice elsewhere, and the final paragraphs shift toward more distant reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("sand crumbling like stale bread beneath her nails"), but some overwriting in metaphor density ("ghost of oceans long buried," "frozen breath") and conceptual repetition around memory/remorse. The phrase "emotionally contagious through touch" appears awkwardly technical, and final paragraphs contain mild paraphrase loops about transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The coral pavilion storing centuries of desert remorse offers a fresh synthesis of place and emotion, with the chef-as-alchemist transformation avoiding expected confrontation patterns. The specific detail of cooking grief into broth shows originality, though the resolution toward communal healing follows somewhat predictable emotional arithmetic.</comment>
