I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and symbolic accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Aris reframes his understanding of scars from wounds to testimonies.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("skull throbbing," "lunged from the cot") and layered contradictions (seeking closure through reopening). The transformation from dissecting scars to reading them as testimonies feels earned through accumulated pressure, though the epiphany edges toward articulated insight rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost - Aris abandons his compulsive reopening practice. Accumulative structure coheres through the hourglass's melting as temporal pressure, though the final insight ("The displaced miracle wasn't the hourglass—it was his own scarred body") veers toward explicit thematic statement rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid selective detail ("sterile scent of antiseptic," "thorns tearing his gown") with the lighthouse tower functioning as constraining micro-setting. The ivy tunnel provides tactile urgency, though some descriptions ("pale gold" dawn, "meteor hush") lean ornamental rather than pressure-generating.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The melting hourglass creates genuine temporal pressure that forces action (tunneling through ivy). Cost is legible in lost telepathy and physical struggle, though escalation occurs through accumulation rather than reversal, fitting the textural lens but lacking a sharp tightening moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the scar-as-story concept and pays off in the shift from "wound to dissect" to "testament." However, the final paragraph explicitly states the thematic conclusion ("love that persisted beyond saving"), reducing resonance to direct assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct medical-philosophical register with controlled modulation ("frantic buzz" to "meteor hush"). The plant telepathy creates an unusual perceptual signature, though some phrases ("displaced miracle," "closure seeker") feel concept-driven rather than voice-organic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts. Some overwriting appears ("celestial shower," "maritime grandfather") and the phrase "displaced miracle" repeats without evolution, creating mild density issues without compromising clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plant telepathy and scar-reading combination offers fresh territory. The hourglass as frozen time preserving telepathy shows imaginative synthesis, though the medical-trauma frame follows familiar patterns of wounded-healer transformation.</comment>
