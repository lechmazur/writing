<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's deafness and emotional numbness create layered internal conflict, with the broken needle discovery driving a credible transformation from defeat to reclamation. The shift from "defeat tasted like dust" to feeling music's "raw, physical soul" shows earned change through concrete action, though Silas remains functional rather than fully pressurizing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details build toward Elara's reconfiguration from numbness to feeling music physically again, with cost visible in her prior loss and isolation. The backward-playing discovery creates genuine causality, though the closure could sharpen the specific price of this new understanding beyond general transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cavern's resonance and the phonograph constrain and enable Elara's discovery—she can only feel the backward vibrations through stone and bone. Sensory hierarchy perfectly reflects deaf POV: "feeling the faint, almost imperceptible thrum" rather than hearing, with the environment becoming instrument.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Escalation builds from numbness through discovery to shared connection, with the broken needle forcing innovative engagement. The dominant stake (defeating numbness) tightens when reversed playback creates "unfamiliar, intricate pulses," though Silas's arrival doesn't add pressure, only validation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The broken needle as "filament of hush" transforms from loss to possibility, reweighting silence from absence to "space where meaning lived." The ending avoids stating its thesis, letting the shared vibration through stone embody connection beyond conventional hearing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "calloused fingers," feeling rather than hearing, vibration as primary sense. Prose rhythm accelerates during discovery ("The machine groaned, the needle scraping") then expands into revelation, with controlled technical precision about the phonograph mechanics.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong sensory specificity and information density, though "profound, audibly muted stillness" and similar abstract constructions occasionally slow momentum. The technical description of backward playing carries high precision, but phrases like "language older than words" edge toward familiar territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of experiencing music through broken equipment played backward offers genuine freshness, transforming disability narrative beyond typical "compensation" arcs. The specific synthesis of deafness, drum-making, and reversed sound creates an inevitable-feeling discovery.</comment>
