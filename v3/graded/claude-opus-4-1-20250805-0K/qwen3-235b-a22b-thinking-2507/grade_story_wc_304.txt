<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling—preserving humanity's last spark before oblivion—with concrete embodiment through trembling fingers and surgical precision. The internal tension between grief and purpose drives her actions credibly. However, Kael remains purely passive, and some phrasing edges toward the abstract ("radiant hush," "threshold of stillness") without sufficient grounding in physical sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-finding in static building to the infusion moment. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Elara preserves the spark with clear cost—the world ending while she holds vigil. The piece teaches its lyric mode early and pays off the "threshold of stillness" at the precise infusion moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto with aurora bleeding emerald/violet creates vivid atmosphere, and the emerald chip functions as micro-setting that constrains the crucial choice. Sensory details (moon-bloom scent, crystalline walls) support the sacred tone. The setting actively shapes the ritual through the grotto's "radiant hush" that seems to pause at the threshold moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from opening—capture life's spark before oblivion swallows everything. The pattern-finding in static creates escalation through the three-beat cadence growing fainter, forcing precise timing. Cost is visible: the world dies as Elara succeeds, creating the tragic trade-off of preservation versus participation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and loss, with the emerald chip embodying humanity's defiant echo against void. The final image of "one spark burned eternal" within "endless night" resonates without stating a moral. The piece earns its wisdom about witness and memory through concrete ritual rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("aurora bled emerald," "death rattle of the world") that matches the elevated tone without losing clarity. POV remains stable with Elara's beautician-mortician perspective coloring perception. Some phrases edge toward purple ("radiant hush" appears twice) but rhythm modulates effectively with the ritual's phases.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the static of a planet shedding its energy") but occasional overwriting ("the fragile threshold of stillness between life's echo and absolute silence"). "Radiant hush" repeats, and some abstract phrasing could be more concrete. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing atmosphere, stakes, or ritual mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The beautician-mortician preparing the dead for aurora's embrace offers a fresh angle on apocalyptic preservation. The synthesis of cosmic death with intimate cosmetic ritual feels specific and earned. Pattern-finding in static as a method for timing soul-capture shows originality, though some atmospheric phrases lean generic.</comment>
