<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's grief-driven motivation to restore spirits while carrying unresolved trauma from her brother's drowning creates compelling internal contradiction, particularly when she encounters his spirit and must confront her survivor's guilt. The moment where "her hands, though still scarred, were steady now" shows earned change through specific action rather than declaration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with each unknotted silence building toward Elara's personal healing through her brother's release—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible emotional cost ("the lucid unrest within her chest easing to a dull ache"). The pattern of exhuming spirits through sharing secrets creates coherent pressure that culminates in the brother's recognition of their mother's lullaby, making the before/after transformation legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary's crystalline walls that fracture moonlight into "trembling rainbows" and the net's physical manifestation of silence as "solidified shadow" create a tactile mystical environment that constrains Elara's work through its specific properties. The sanctuary's "profound, interlaced hush" functions as micro-setting that shapes how spirits must be approached—through whispers on breath rather than sound.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from releasing anonymous spirits to confronting her brother's ghost, with the silence shifting from "cold and heavy" to "burning" as personal trauma intensifies the work. The cost is legible when "the heavy silence in her palm transformed into a light, warm pulse" showing both the price paid and the release earned through facing her deepest wound.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of grounding through acknowledgment rather than burial emerges organically from Elara's work, with the net's "interlaced hush" serving as both literal tool and metaphor for accumulated grief. The final image of Elara continuing her work with "hands, though still scarred, were steady now" offers a non-literal answer about healing through service rather than erasure of pain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "frayed edge of the mask fragment" and "crystalline walls fractured the moonlight," though occasional overwriting ("solidified shadow, a physical manifestation of the ocean's indifference") creates density that slightly obscures momentum. The POV remains stable with Elara's perceptual signature focused on texture and silence throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("each knotted strand a captured sigh, a stifled prayer"), overwriting creates density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff ("filament of pure silence, cold and heavy, coiled into her waiting palm"). Template cadence appears in the spirit-release sequences where similar structures repeat across encounters.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of spirits trapped in fishing nets requiring "grounding, not graves" through the sharing of secrets offers a fresh angle on ghost stories, though the execution relies on familiar grief-and-healing patterns. The specific detail of silence as tangible weight that can be held and transformed provides originality within the supernatural framework.</comment>
