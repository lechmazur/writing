<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's guilt-driven motivation earns through specific betrayal backstory, and her transition from gossip columnist to spirit exorcist shows layered characterization. The reconciliation choice carries visible cost—accepting imperfection rather than seeking absolution. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("pruning what I didn't understand") that edges toward therapy-speak in the confrontation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details (lilac scent, electrical currents, sheet music) build toward Resonant Reconfiguration where Silas transforms from hostile specter to gentle presence. Closure lands with clear cost: the orchard's imminent destruction makes this reconciliation both urgent and bittersweet. The "imperfect miracle" conceptually reprices both the exorcism and the apology as incomplete but sufficient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive's dusty, electrical atmosphere and the perfume bottle's chipped crystal constrain Elara's method—she must use induced currents through frayed wiring. Sensory hierarchy reflects her exorcist perspective: ozone tang, lilac scent intensifying, sheet music fluttering. The orchard viewed through grimy windows creates effective contrast between dying exterior and charged interior space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal guilt to time pressure (chainsaws at dawn) to spiritual reconciliation. The induced current method creates genuine risk and the confrontation forces Elara to translate her apology into Silas's musical language. Cost is legible: reconciliation without resurrection, acceptance of the orchard's death, transformation of haunting into gentle presence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the perfume bottle's imperfection mirroring the flawed apology, both "ghost of bloom, not the living thing." The musical metaphor system (dissonant chord needing resolution) organically develops without forcing. Final image of hearing melody beneath chainsaw's snarl offers resonant answer: beauty persists through destruction, reconciliation outlasts physical loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends journalistic precision ("ink-stained fingers now stained with something older") with lyrical compression. Dialogue between Elara and Silas maintains subtext—his "You cut me down before the harvest" carrying both literal and metaphorical weight. Some filter verb accumulation ("she muttered," "she whispered") slightly dulls immediacy in places.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong figurative language ("silence thick as unplayed sheet music," "gossip was the city's heartbeat... silence is the arrhythmia") serves thematic purpose. Information density high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive "she [verb]" constructions in middle section and some paraphrase loops around the imperfect miracle concept that don't add new pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exorcism-as-electrical-engineering with gossip columnist background creates non-obvious angle. The "imperfect miracle" concept transforms typical ghost story resolution—reconciliation without erasure, acceptance without absolution. Risk-taking in the lyrical accumulative structure and metaphor-heavy dialogue heightens stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
