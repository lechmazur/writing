<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied transformation with contradictory impulses ("combative tenderness") acting simultaneously in the climactic moment. The final choice to embrace her sea nature is earned through prior causality—years of denial, physical markers (gills, healing), and the scrimshaw's unlocking—with visible cost in abandoning her land life. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("true nature") in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms from denying to embracing her nature, with cost legible in "shedding a skin that no longer served her" and abandoning the docks. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the whale's call, island's rise, and scrimshaw's glow creating density that forces stance crystallization. Orientation anchors (dock worker, sublittoral fringe) establish clearly by ~50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—it's the liminal space where transformation becomes possible. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("water rising to her waist, then her chest"). The disappearing island's emergence charges the final image as sanctuary beneath waves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging/identity) signaled early and tightens through accumulating pressure: whale's call, scrimshaw's warmth, island's emergence. The cost is unmistakable in "letting go of the life that had never fit" and the physical transformation that forecloses return. Agency manifests as decisive acceptance rather than resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete transformation without stated moral—the ending reweights "half-sea" from insult to truth. The scrimshaw unlocking hearts becomes literal for Elara's own locked heart. Minor deduction for "true nature" appearing multiple times as thematic echo in prompt-like language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Elara experiences water ("liquid emerald where sunlight pierced the depths"). Voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity, though some register drift into elevated diction ("ethereal shimmer," "combative tenderness") slightly exceeds the dock worker's established lexicon. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is moderate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. Template cadence appears in transformation sequence ("She was...," "She could...," "She took...") and some paraphrase loops ("calling her home"/"urging her to let go"). Mixed metaphor of "wings stretching" for a sea creature. Clear propulsion in final third despite these artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of selkie-like transformation with dock worker identity offers a fresh angle, though the core premise of denying one's magical nature is familiar. Specific details like "sublittoral fringe" and whalebone scrimshaw create particularity. The transformation follows expected beats without significant risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
