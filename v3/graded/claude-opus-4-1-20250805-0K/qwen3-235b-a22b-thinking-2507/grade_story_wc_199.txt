<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation through urgent need to decode leaf-messages drives consistent action, with embodied details like "fingers dusted with pollen and purpose." The transformation from seed-sorting to monument-building shows earned change through specific discovery. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "mossy delight" recurring without deeper contradiction or cost visible in her choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from seed-sorting through leaf-reading to monument-building, with the moonstone dust speck prod as decisive trigger. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when monuments cause ash to part and green shoots to emerge, with visible cost in abandoning her life's work of sorting. The "forgetting as severing" revelation reweights the opening's decay imagery effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor constrains choices throughout—its decay motivates seed-sorting, its platform enables monument-building, and its transformation charges the ending. Sensory specificity excels: "roots trailing like beards through choked air," "phosphor-moss lamps." The moonstone dust speck functions as micro-setting that enables the crucial leaf-reading choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal ritual to world-transformation as Elara decodes the leaf's message and abandons her sorting to build monuments. The Hush creates temporal pressure that forces action. Cost appears when she forsakes her ordered chest for uncertain monument-building, though the transformation's ease slightly reduces tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: remembrance versus forgetting embodied in seed-sorting, monument-building, and the revelation that "forgetting" caused the Great Burning. The ending's green shoots through grey earth offer non-literal answer to loss without moralizing. "The land emerges transformed always" gains layered meaning through the requirement that "forgotten things were remembered."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows in selective botanical attention ("maple samara, birch catkin") and the specific joy in ordering. Voice maintains lyric consistency through "mossy delight" as textural anchor. Some register elevation in climactic passages ("the veil thinned and the land's true voice") slightly exceeds established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose density high with lines doing multiple jobs: "sorted seeds beneath the ashen skyborne arbor" establishes action, setting, and atmosphere simultaneously. Strong specificity in "ghost-white poppy, ironwood, sky-orchid." Minor template cadence in monument-building sequence ("a cairn...for," "a spiral...for") and slight overwriting in "pure and cold as moonlight."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological memory with fantasy elements—seeds as memory vessels, monuments to species rather than people. The "forgetting as fire" reversal and moonstone-as-lens for chlorophyll language show genuine invention. Specific details like "phosphor-moss lamps" and the suspended forest create memorable world.</comment>
