<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—to prove boundaries are illusions of fear—and drives her concrete actions throughout. The internal certainty that "surged through her" effectively embodies her conviction, though the piece relies heavily on abstract declarations ("The boundary is a wound") rather than showing internal contradiction in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's transformation of the atrium from sanctum to beacon, with visible cost in the dissolution of generations-old sacred boundaries. The accumulative/textural lens holds as shadow-poetry literally rewrites meaning through layered paraphrasing, culminating in the final image of the "cobalt mirror holding the new world they had made."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen lake, humming quartz colonnade, and cobalt atrium constrain and enable Elara's shadow-work—she must find "the precise angle where shadow met quartz" and the colonnade's resonance physically responds to her art. The setting actively participates through the quartz becoming "momentarily translucent" to allow passage and the lake serving as both canvas and mirror for her work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal artistic expression to rewriting societal laws, with Elara's shadow-poetry progressively dissolving more fundamental boundaries—first the physical colonnade barrier, then the ancient glyphs themselves. The cost registers in "the city's collective breath shift[ing]" and the permanent transformation of sacred space, though the opposition remains entirely passive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through Elara's concrete act of paraphrasing prohibitions into possibilities—"Fear guards emptiness" overlaying "Shadows deceive"—without explicit moralizing. The final image of her shadow as "no longer a mark of heresy but a bridge" resonantly answers the central question about boundaries through specific transformation rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm ("fragile as moth wings against glass") and distinctive perceptual signature focused on light, shadow, and resonance. However, abstract philosophical declarations ("The boundary is a wound") occasionally replace embodied perception, and some phrases feel over-elevated for moments of physical action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, but suffers from repetitive conceptual phrasing around "dissolving boundaries" (appears 5+ times) and occasional overwriting in figurative density. The phrase "paraphrase" and its variants create mild synonym churn, and abstract declarations sometimes replace concrete imagery in key beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of shadow-poetry as literal rewriting of law offers a fresh synthesis of art and political transformation, with the specific innovation of "paraphrasing" old edicts through overlaying new meanings. The piece commits fully to its premise, though the lack of active opposition and the somewhat predictable triumph limit its risk-taking.</comment>
