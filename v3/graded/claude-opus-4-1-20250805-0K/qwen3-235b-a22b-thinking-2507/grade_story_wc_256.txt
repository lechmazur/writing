<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through her calloused hands and quest to recover lost connection through sound. The final choice to ring the bell after years of silence carries visible cost and transforms her understanding from seeking restoration to accepting absence as presence. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "texture of connection" that occasionally drifts toward concept rather than embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's final bell-ringing transforms lost sounds from absence into felt presence. The lens refracts sound into visible form (dust helix at 137.5 Hz) building density toward the finale where "the lost sounds flooded back—not as noise, but as a shared breath." Cost is legible in tears and the acceptance that connection isn't restoration but feeling "absence as a presence."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The carbide lamp lens functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables discovery—its "thick, yellowed glass" bends light to reveal trapped harmonics in dust motes. Setting actively shapes the climactic choice when Elara places the lens against the bell's clapper, fracturing sound into "a spectrum of light and sound." The laboratory's "vaulted chambers of felt and copper" and "golden shadows" create consistent atmospheric pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes intensify through Elara's discovery that sounds persist as "dormant vibrations in the grid's static," building to her risk of ringing the silent bell. The escalation follows the accumulative lens as density increases from theoretical questioning to physical manifestation (dust helix) to final action. Cost appears in "tears traced paths through the dust on her cheeks" and the foreclosure of pure restoration in favor of transformed understanding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that connection exists not in audible restoration but in "layered like sedimentary rock" traces—each stratum holding compressed humanity. The final image of dissolved dust-helix merging with new resonance embodies the theme without stating it. Strong resonance in "remembering how to feel its absence as a presence" though occasionally edges toward abstract philosophizing about connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice with specialized lexicon ("137.5 Hz," "prism-song bell ringer," "harmonic residues") that maintains consistency. Strong perceptual signature in how Elara notices sound as physical presence in dust and wire. Some register elevation in phrases like "artificial pilgrimage" and occasional drift toward academic diction ("structured silence holding forgotten frequencies") that doesn't fully match the tactile, technical POV established elsewhere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "dust danced in the golden shadows, vibrating at 137.5 Hz." However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("texture of connection," "artificial pilgrimage") and some redundancy in describing the bell's resonance effects. The phrase "powerfully gentle" appears three times with minimal variation. Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "She [verb]" constructions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound archaeology with mining equipment repurposed for acoustic recovery—the carbide lamp revealing sound trapped in dust is genuinely inventive. The specific frequency (137.5 Hz) and transformation of absence into presence through physical resonance avoids generic resolution. Some derivative elements in the "Great Silence" backstory and occasional retreat to safety in abstract phrasing about connection.</comment>
