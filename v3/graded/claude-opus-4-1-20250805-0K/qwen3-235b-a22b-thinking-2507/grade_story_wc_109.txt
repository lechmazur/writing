<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's obsessive drive to preserve and translate the prophecy creates clear, escalating motivation throughout. The internal contradiction between her oracle's gift blooming at the peaceful shore versus her current storm-tossed isolation drives authentic tension. Her transformation from passive receiver of prophecy to active cartographer of silence shows earned agency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the mapping of silence until the final Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara discovers "silence was not the end, but the ground beneath your feet." The closure lands with conceptual cost—the world has entered endless night—while offering navigational hope through her completed map. The pattern of silence-as-cartography coheres early and pays off at the prophesied moment when "the single star winked out."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ridge fort setting actively pressures choices through the storm's violence contrasting with the "marbled hush" of her cell, creating the specific silences she must map. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"salt spray stinging the arrow slits," "cold stone," "guttering candlelight"—all filtered through Elara's oracle perspective. The environment constrains her work to this single night before dawn fails, though some spatial choreography could be clearer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing the map before endless night arrives—escalates through the storm's rhythm providing the very silences she must document. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as each marked silence ("a wide, curving bay of quiet") builds toward the final revelation. The cost is legible when "the single star winked out" and "darkness, absolute and immense, flooded the ridge fort," yet she finds navigation possible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of mapping absence rather than presence, suggesting meaning lives in negative space. The final realization that "silence was not the end, but the ground beneath your feet" offers a non-literal answer to surviving catastrophe through understanding its shape. The recurring motif of preservation (the flaking booklet, the map-as-ward) deepens without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinct lyric register appropriate to an oracle's perception, with controlled rhythm that modulates between the storm's violence and the cell's hush. Some filter verbs ("she knew," "she recalled") could be cut for immediacy, but the perceptual signature—focusing on silence's texture and shape—remains consistent. The voice holds through pressure without degrading into generic description.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("ambered hush, thick with the preserved silence"). The prose maintains momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks that mirror the storm's rhythm. Some redundancy appears in the middle section with multiple restatements of the silence-mapping concept that could be compressed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of cartographing silence to navigate endless night offers genuine freshness, transforming the apocalyptic prophecy trope through specific method. The story commits fully to its concept, following the implications of silence-as-terrain without retreat. While oracle figures are familiar, making her gift explicitly about mapping absence rather than seeing futures provides originality.</comment>
