<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's scheming pacifism manifests through concrete tactical choices (the music box gambit, calculated silence) with clear cost at closure when Kael releases his resentment. The cellular memory concept creates genuine internal contradiction as Kael fights then surrenders to buried peace. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("release wasn't surrender but reclaiming") in exposition rather than embodied action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael exhales his resentment "like smoke from a room," with visible emotional cost in his "shuddering breath." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the music box's notes accumulate to trigger cellular memory. Deduction for slightly abstract cost description and some causality softness around how the broken pin "aligns with shifting grace."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary constrains the interaction perfectly—silence creates the "vacuum where grace could manifest." Reality's violent shifts (marble to oak to stone) provide textural pressure that times the music box's activation. The broken pin as micro-setting enables the central choice. Some generic descriptors ("cool floor," "marble halls") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: single note → cellular memory flood → multiple notes → full surrender. The dominant stake (teaching Kael to release resentment before reality consumes them) faces genuine pressure as reality fractures. Cost is visible in Kael's tears and shuddering release, though the resolution feels slightly convenient with the perfectly-timed grace alignment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of resentment as "poison" and "prison built from smoke," paid off when Kael exhales it "like smoke from a room." The music box as key to cellular memory avoids abstraction. Minor deduction for explicit thematic statement ("Resentment chains you to the past") though it's earned by prior dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on tactile details and body states. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("It's broken" / "The melody lives in us"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("shifting grace," "cellular memory") slightly exceeds the established lexicon. Free indirect style clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("walls shimmered like heat haze," "exhaled...like smoke from a room") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "cellular memory" (5 instances) and some abstract constructions ("grace could manifest"). Template cadence appears in exposition ("She believed...," "She'd chosen...," "She'd schemed..."). Information density generally good with multi-purpose sentences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The broken music box triggering body memory through impossible sound in a soundless space offers genuine freshness. "Cellular memory" as mechanism for peace retrieval transforms the healing trope. The synthesis feels mostly earned though "shifting grace" as a natural force that conveniently aligns remains somewhat abstract.</comment>
