I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery, sound, and ritual toward a resonant reconfiguration where laughter returns to the household.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—transforming grief into healing through her wind symphony—is embodied through concrete actions and the "mournfully eager" tension in her shoulders. The contradiction between her mechanical orchestra and tender lullabies creates authentic complexity. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient emotional resolution in her husband and daughter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the manufactured wind carries transformed grief upward, triggering laughter in the household—a clear before/after with emotional cost visible in "the first since the grain had fallen." The accumulative structure coheres through sound layering. Slight dock for the mechanical ease of the family's response.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel functions as both setting and instrument, its curved walls shaping wind into "a single, powerful, off-key gust." The concrete ribs, dust motes in dying light, and forgotten vents create a visceral underground-to-household connection that enables the story's central action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the accumulation of sound—seven blowers roaring to life, wind macerating leaves into "golden-brown mist," lullabies fragmenting in stone. The cost appears in Elara's white knuckles and cracking voice, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of mechanical noise into emotional release—grief literally ground into particles and lifted. The image of "particles catching the light like suspended tears" and the final "fragile, restored melody" resist simple consolation while honoring loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines lyrical density ("concrete ribs arching above her like the ribs of some long-dead leviathan") with technical precision about the blowers. The perceptual signature—seeing dust as tears, wind as carrier—remains consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "the pull cord handle of the oldest leaf blower felt like a baton, its frayed rope worn smooth by desperate hands." Some metaphor density in places ("leviathan," "tomb," "sentinels") but serves the accumulative mode. Minor template cadence in the blower startup sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise of grief-as-symphony conducted through leaf blowers offers genuine freshness. The specific synthesis of industrial machinery with lullabies, underground tunnel with household above, creates an inevitable-feeling logic unique to this story.</comment>
