<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's grief-driven motivation is embodied through concrete actions (folding cranes, polishing gems) with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—the need to preserve versus the pain of remembering. The final choice to continue transforming grief into light shows earned endurance with visible cost. Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("luminous torment") that could be more fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where grief transforms into "folded hope." The cost is visible in Elara's tears and raw sobs as she polishes. Orientation anchors (floating island, tea garden, basilica) established early. The closure lands with both felt emotional cost and the conceptual cost of accepting perpetual transformation work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden and glass basilica create atmospheric pressure through vivid sensory detail (mist curling, jade ponds, liquid gold light). The geode's transformation from "dull as dried blood" to "lavender radiance" constrains Elara's emotional journey. Setting actively shapes the final choice through the stone lanterns lining the path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through textural accumulation as Elara moves from passive crane-folding to active gem-polishing, with each stage extracting higher emotional cost. The geode's resistance and eventual yielding creates meaningful pressure that forces stance crystallization. The "descends while ascending" paradox effectively captures the simultaneous rise/fall of grief work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation metaphor—friction creating clarity, grief shaped into light. The final image of Elara turning toward another geode offers a non-literal answer about perpetual transformation without stating a moral. "Luminous torment" becomes more than description, embodying the paradox that beauty and pain share the same spectrum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with selective focus on tactile and visual details fitting a craftsperson's POV. Some elevated diction ("basilica," "alchemy") stretches but doesn't break the voice. Minor register inconsistencies in emotional peaks ("raw, ragged sound") but rhythm control supports pressure effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("light felt like knives," "beauty that flayed her open"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some repetitive phrasing around "luminous torment" and "descends while ascending" but these function as intentional refrains rather than loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of Eastern (origami) and Western (basilica) grief rituals with fantastical elements (floating island, dream recording) creates a fresh angle. The specific transformation of raw geodes into lanterns through polishing offers an original metaphor for grief work. The commitment to the premise follows through without retreat.</comment>
