<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from hollow vessel to active creator is well-earned through concrete action, with visible cost in her vulnerability ("I want to belong"). The shift from ghostwriting others' emotions to creating genuine connection shows clear internal contradiction resolved through embodied choice. Loses points for some therapy-speak ("curated connections") and the thrush's overly neat approval, but the core arc lands with specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and symbolic elements build toward Elara's resonant reconfiguration from isolation to connection. The closure lands with visible cost through her public vulnerability and the collective weaving that transforms her role. Minor orientation wobble with the temple's purpose/context, but the drive lens remains clear and the final image of the "living installation" crystallizes her change with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lotus temple, lily pond, and stone archway effectively constrain and enable Elara's transformation, with the abandoned arch becoming essential to her solution. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("prismatic quiet," "mossy stone bench"). The thrush's nest functions as micro-setting that directly shapes her artistic choice. Loses points for some generic nature imagery that doesn't fully leverage the temple's specific spiritual context.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake of genuine connection versus borrowed sentiment escalates through Elara's shift from passive observation to active creation. The public art installation raises stakes by requiring her vulnerability, with visible cost in exposing her own secret. The accumulation of others' contributions deepens pressure effectively. Missing a sharper middle tightening that would force a harder trade-off before the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between "borrowed phrases" and authentic connection, with the thrush's nest as natural architecture paralleling human connection-building. The final image of the collective "larger nest" resonates without stating a moral. Subtext operates well through the anonymous messages and shared vulnerability. Slight deduction for the thrush's overly tidy approval chirp.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Elara's attention to texture and connection ("traced the damp wood," "tactile intimacy"). Voice modulates appropriately from contemplative to active, maintaining consistency. The POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Minor register drift with phrases like "curator of connections" that feel slightly academic for the lyrical voice established.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose maintains good momentum with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is generally strong, with most lines advancing character or atmosphere. Some overwriting in figurative language ("stone blossom from the water") and occasional template phrasing ("drawn by the inevitably whimsical sight"). The "vessel for others' emotions" metaphor recurs without sufficient evolution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a ghostwriter creating public participatory art offers a fresh angle on connection and authenticity. The transformation from private to public vulnerability feels earned and specific. The weaving metaphor works organically with both the thrush's nest and human connection themes. Loses some points for the somewhat predictable arc of isolation to community, though execution remains strong.</comment>
