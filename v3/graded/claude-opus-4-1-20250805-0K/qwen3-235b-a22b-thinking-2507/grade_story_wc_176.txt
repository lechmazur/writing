<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through her lost wax casting expertise as metaphor for preservation through sacrifice. The snowmelt ardor and forgiveness backstory effectively anchor her drive without over-explaining. Minor deduction for slight therapy-speak around forgiveness ("quiet ground from which her purpose finally grew") but the embodied craft details and specific named voices (Anya, Kael, Liora) ground the emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where the rope's reconfiguration transforms sound into light, then bronze—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (tears, the burned wax, the preserved names). The piece teaches its pattern early through the lost wax metaphor and pays it off when bronze captures light-patterns. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. Minor deduction for slight causality softness in how exactly the rope "illuminates truths."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum functions as active constraint—the cold threatens the fragile punched card while the aurora provides necessary light for the ritual. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("breath plumed," "ghost joining the cathedral of ice"). The rope, card, and bronze tools all constrain choices and enable the final transformation, elevating setting beyond description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through textural accumulation: from handling the fragile card to reconfiguring the rope to the aurora's violent flare, each step risks losing the names forever. The cost is visible in Elara's tears and the sacrificial burning of wax. Slight deduction because the rope's magical properties arrive without earlier grounding, but the emotional stakes and technical precision create genuine tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lost wax casting metaphor—preservation requires sacrifice, forgiveness enables purpose. The specific names and their stories (Anya's lullabies, Kael's mining songs) resist abstraction. The final image of names living in "bronze and light" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. Minor deduction for one instance of mild theme-speak ("resistance against oblivion").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through technical precision ("technically gentle," "calibrated by decades") and craft-specific perception. Some register elevation in emotional peaks ("snowmelt ardor," "cathedral of ice") fits the lyrical mode but occasionally drifts toward purple. No dialogue to evaluate. The perceptual signature of a craftsperson noticing through touch and material properties is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good information density, though some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("aurora light bleeding through frozen vaults like liquid emerald"). Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "She [verb]" constructions. Some elevated diction ("snowmelt ardor") risks register drift but serves the lyrical tone. The technical descriptions of rope-work and casting are precise without becoming mechanical.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost wax casting with memory preservation offers a fresh angle on the "saving the forgotten" trope. The specific craft details and named voices avoid generic abstraction. The rope's reconfiguration as a technology for translating sound to light shows imaginative reach, though the magical element arrives somewhat conveniently.</comment>
