<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to protect the living by severing connections while teaching release to trapped spirits shows clear internal contradiction acted in scene. The final choice to burn bridges "one suffocating soul at a time" demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost—her increasing isolation. The link through shared drowning trauma creates authentic emotional specificity, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("the raw wounds of her grief became the only bridge").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara teaches the child release through shared stillness, accepting deeper isolation as cost. The threshold's progressive thinning and the sanctuary's increasing desolation after each act create visible, accumulating price. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary with its "skeletal remains of the roof" and "fading threshold" constrains Elara's choices—she must work within this deteriorating space. The threshold itself functions as micro-setting that shapes tactics, pulsing weakly and requiring careful tending. Sensory detail effectively narrows to ash, cold, and starlight, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("starlight bled through").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The child spirit's suffocating despair creates escalating pressure that Elara must counter through her own scarred memory of drowning. The threshold's thinning after resolution shows clear cost—each success weakens her barrier. Stakes deepen from maintaining boundaries to teaching release at personal expense, with the final image of joining "the starlight above" foreclosing her path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of necessary isolation and sacrifice emerges through Elara's repeated bridge-burning and the paradox of connection through severance. The final image of the doorknocker as "forgotten promise" and "silent witness to the careful, necessary work of letting go" offers resonant non-literal answer to whether isolation can be redemptive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm, though occasionally drifts toward overwriting ("suffocating despair that made the air itself feel heavy"). The perceptual signature—focusing on ash, boundaries, and absence—stays character-specific. Some repetitive phrasing appears ("burned bridges carefully" twice), and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("silence here wasn't peaceful; it was a loaded emptiness") but suffers from repetitive stems and occasional overwriting. The phrase "burned bridges carefully" appears verbatim twice, "ashen charcoal sanctuary" repeats exactly, and some metaphors strain ("Starlight bled"). Information density varies, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others loop concepts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of a guardian who must sever all connections to protect others offers fresh angle on sacrifice. The specific mechanism of "linking through scars"—using personal trauma as bridge to understanding—transforms familiar ghost-story elements. The ending's commitment to isolation as necessary work avoids safety-middle resolution.</comment>
