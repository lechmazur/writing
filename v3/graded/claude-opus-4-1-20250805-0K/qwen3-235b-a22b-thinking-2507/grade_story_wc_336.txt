<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation burns clear through embodied detail—her calloused hands, the weight in her heart, her decades of patient tree-wisdom manifest in concrete action. The internal conflict between grief over the last Wonderbloom's death and determination to restore wonder creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the spectral orchard sequence trending toward abstraction rather than maintaining embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the cerulean's return washing "despair from the land" with visible community transformation. The ritual's progression from physical seed to spectral essence-gathering to replanting creates coherent escalation. Cost is legible in Elara's chest-ache memory and the sacrifice required for "succor." Minor weakness: the spectral realm mechanics could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The verdant parapet and waterfall create immediate spatial grounding with sensory richness—moss, ferns, mist settling "like a cool sigh." The spectral orchard's cerulean glow provides vivid contrast to the gray-bled valley. Setting constrains choice through the specific location needed for planting. Deduction for the spectral realm lacking the same tactile specificity as the physical world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes signal early—the valley's dimmed spirit and "hollow eyes" establish what's at risk. Escalation builds through the ritual's deepening: physical preparation, consciousness-diving, essence-weaving, the "sudden ache" of memory that tests resolve. The cerulean's return spreading "like a silent song" provides clear resolution with visible community impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the weaving metaphor—"each cut a stitch, each graft a thread"—connecting physical pruning to memory preservation. The final line "wonder lived in the weave, not the wound" offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The cerulean color carries thematic weight as embodied wonder throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's pruner's lens—seeing "slow, patient truths" in trees, experiencing the spectral realm through craft-specific metaphors. Prose modulates effectively from grounded description to lyrical essence-gathering. Some register elevation during the spectral sequence ("spectral petals coalesced") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery—"petals shimmering like captured sky," "droplet hovering above her palm like a fallen star." Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting in the spectral sequence and some template phrasing ("She moved through," "She closed her eyes") that could be more varied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological wisdom and magical realism through the specific lens of orchard pruning as world-weaving. The concept of capturing emotional essence rather than physical material offers non-obvious angle. The integration of craft knowledge with spectral work feels organic and earned.</comment>
