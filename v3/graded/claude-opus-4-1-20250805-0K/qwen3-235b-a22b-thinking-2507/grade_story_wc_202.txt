I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered discoveries and sensory details toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara unfastens the ledger, honoring the keepers' histories.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in familial connection to the lighthouse keepers. The contradiction between public dismissal ("mere superstition") and her grandmother's reverence creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for somewhat abstract interiority ("between-worlds translator, not of languages, but of meanings") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara unfastens the ledger and commits to translating the keepers' names. The accumulative lens holds through three painting discoveries that build pressure. Cost is visible in the emotional weight of recognition ("her great-uncle's script") and the commitment to future action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting functions well as both physical space (swaying walkway, brass case) and constraint on choice (the paintings hold the key). The lighthouse lens fragment serves as micro-setting that enables discovery. Sensory details like "bottled starlight and powdered memories" enhance atmosphere though occasionally drift toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through three painting discoveries, each revealing deeper connection to the keepers' histories. The pressure builds from coordinates to ship's logs to final transmissions, with personal cost crystallizing when Elara recognizes her great-uncle's script. The challenge structure provides clear escalation under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of making the invisible visible - the lens revealing hidden truths parallels honoring overlooked histories. The lighthouse as "translator of between-worlds" resonates without being stated as moral. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit thematic statement about "honoring overlooked histories" near the end.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the fantastical setting. Perceptual signature evident in how Elara experiences through the lens of memory and intuition. Some filter verb accumulation ("she saw," "she understood") and occasional register drift into abstraction ("eternal instant where childhood awe met present purpose") reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("fractured glass both elusively tangible and heavy with memory") but suffers from density issues. Multiple abstract concepts stack without breathing room, and some sentences attempt too many simultaneous jobs. Template cadence appears in the painting examination sequence ("She raised... she held... she angled").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of using a lighthouse lens fragment to read hidden histories in paintings offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of family history with fantastical elements feels organic. However, the "chosen one reveals hidden knowledge" framework, while well-executed, doesn't fully transform its archetypal roots.</comment>
