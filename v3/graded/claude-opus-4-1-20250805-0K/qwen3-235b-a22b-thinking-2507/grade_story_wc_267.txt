<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in the specific loss of her voice, with embodied details like "nerves hummed with returning life" and the concrete discovery of the piano bolt. The internal conflict between accepting safety's cost versus hoping for recovery plays out through micro-choices, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("the fortress's terrible arithmetic") rather than staying fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's shift from "servant of silence" to "its student," with visible cost in her choice to remain despite understanding the price. The accumulative/textural lens coheres as sensory details and reflections build toward her final stance, though the middle section relies heavily on reflection (approaching 30% threshold) that sometimes summarizes rather than dramatizes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress functions as both setting and constraint, with specific details like "dusty spiral staircase" and "faint ochre smudge" driving the discovery. The piano bolt serves as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image when placed on the empty piano, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding safety's cost—deepens through Elara's discovery of the bolt and recognition that "safety required surrender," though escalation occurs primarily through internal realization rather than external pressure. The cost becomes legible in her choice to remain as witness rather than prisoner, but the conflict lacks the tightening pressure that would elevate the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the piano bolt's transformation from concert hall relic to symbol of "the cost of choosing survival over song." The ending offers a non-literal answer through Elara's choice to remain as witness, though passages like "the fortress's terrible arithmetic" and "seraphically mundane endurance" occasionally state rather than embody the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency with evocative phrases like "cobalt purgatory" and "frostbitten hope," creating a distinct melancholic register. However, register drift appears in abstract passages ("the fortress's terrible arithmetic," "seraphically mundane endurance") that shift into philosophical mode rather than maintaining Elara's embodied perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("light from a high window caught the slightest discoloration") but suffers from paraphrase loops ("safety required surrender, the silencing of joy to preserve flesh" restates the same concept). Template cadence appears in repeated "She [verb]" constructions, and abstract philosophizing ("terrible arithmetic") dulls momentum in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of a silent bellhop whose atrophied vocal cords mirror the fortress's enforced quiet offers a fresh angle on survival versus expression. The specific detail of the piano bolt as catalyst for understanding transforms what could be generic introspection, though the execution sometimes retreats to safer abstraction rather than maintaining bold specificity.</comment>
