<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Aris's motivation to "discover the texture of time" drives concrete choices under pressure, with embodied emotion in "trembling fingers" and "heart hammered." The final renunciation (leaving photographs behind) carries visible cost, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("grief...lived in the hollow where memories used to be").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as hyperbolic geometry fragments accumulate pressure toward Aris touching the halo fragment, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where time's texture is revealed as grief. Cost is legible in the blank photograph and abandoned memories, though the final "world that had moved on without him" could be more specific.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The living bridge garden's hyperbolic geometry constrains Aris's movements and choices throughout, with vivid sensory detail ("crushed mint and ozone"). The environment actively participates in closure as it collapses "with a sound like tearing silk," charging the final desolate image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from trapped observation to active crawling through earth to grasping the fragment, with each action narrowing options. The cost manifests in dissolving photographs and lost years, though the garden's collapse could generate more immediate physical consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that "the texture of time was grief," earned through Aris's specific experience with the fragment. The final image of "infinitely heavy" absence resonates without moralizing, though "moved on without him" verges on abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "ink bleeding into ghostly smudges like smoke caught in amber" and controlled modulation as voice fragments during the disintegration sequence. POV remains stable with purposeful compression during peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("hedges breathed and shifted...folding time into origami shapes"). Some overwriting in extended metaphors ("tapestry woven thread by thread") and occasional register drift ("residual chroniton energy").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The hyperbolic geometry prison and halo fragment's time-warping properties create fresh stakes, with the specific synthesis of garden design and temporal texture feeling inevitable. Risk-taking in the non-linear temporal structure heightens meaning without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
