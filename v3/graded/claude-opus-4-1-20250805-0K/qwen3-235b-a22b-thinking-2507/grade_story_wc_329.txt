<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action—her violin playing as rebellion against mechanical oppression. The internal conflict between knowing and understanding creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the statue's transformation feeling slightly convenient, though the emotional cost of liberation lands effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the statue's liberation transforms the orchard from mechanical to natural. The cost is visible in the statue's collapse and the earth's fracturing. The gap between knowing/understanding closes meaningfully, though the transformation mechanism could be more clearly established earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mechanical orchard with brass fruit and copper leaves creates vivid, purposeful imagery that constrains Elara's choices. The locust shell functions as micro-setting, enabling her method. The sensory details (clinking leaves, grinding stone) support the dominant stake, and the final green sprout charges the closure with earned contrast.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear escalation from playing notes to commanding them, with the statue's hesitation creating a meaningful turn. The dominant stake (reawakening beauty) faces concrete opposition through the statues. Cost is visible in the statue's destruction and earth's upheaval, though the single reversal feels slightly thin for full tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation from mechanical to organic, avoiding explicit moralizing. The gap between knowing/understanding provides thematic depth. The final image of the green sprout offers a non-literal answer about liberation through synchronization rather than force, though some symbolic elements (brass fruit) feel slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled, lyrical prose matching the musical protagonist. Strong perceptual signature in how Elara notices resonance and vibration. Some elevated diction ("tarnished wonder," "resonantly soft") occasionally drifts from immediacy, and repetition of "resonantly soft" creates minor echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive use of "resonantly soft" (three times) and some elevated register that occasionally obscures immediacy ("sluggish pulse," "subsonic plea"). The closing image lands cleanly despite these minor frictions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The locust shell as resonance amplifier offers a fresh angle on magical transformation. The concept of statues as anchors rather than mere guards provides genuine surprise. However, the mechanical-to-organic transformation trope is familiar, and some elements (brass fruit, copper leaves) feel template-adjacent without full transformation.</comment>
