<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal contradiction between creative ambition and monastic silence drives a credible renunciation with visible cost. The "excruciatingly gentle" movements and methodical abandonment of his dream show embodied emotion under pressure. Slight deduction for the bells being "forever unvoiced" which tells rather than shows their silence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis form) where Elias transforms his burden into "a quiet, foundational stone" with visible cost in the forecourt ritual. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the bell placement ceremony. Cost is legible in "the crushing weight he had carried in his chest for twenty years eased, not gone, but settled."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forecourt's transformation from "glacial hush" to "crystal whispering" with "thousand tiny diamonds of water" constrains Elias's ritual to this specific moment after rain. Setting actively shapes the choice through "petrichor nostalgia" and the sunrise striking the bells. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing like "breathing jewel."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of making peace with abandoned dreams escalates through the physical burden of carrying the coffer, the ritual placement, and the sunrise transformation. Cost is visible in twenty years of silence and the final acceptance. However, no active opposition or complication deepens the pressure beyond the protagonist's internal resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the bells as "quiet ghosts of a symphony that would never be" without stating a moral. The final image of silver constellation "glinting in the new morning" resonantly answers the question of how to bear unfulfilled dreams. Strong integration of silence-as-tomb becoming silence-as-foundation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "glacial hush...weight that settled deep in the lungs" and selective attention to sound/silence. Voice modulates from contemplative to ceremonial during the ritual. Some elevated diction ("petrichor nostalgia," "nascent sunlight") slightly strains the clock scribe's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "silence shaping him as slowly and irrevocably as ice carves a valley." However, several instances of overwriting: "breathing jewel," "crystal whispering forecourt," and redundant phrasing in "bear it one last time"/"bear witness." Template cadence in "He did not...His task was simply" structure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of monastic silence with abandoned musical ambition offers a specific angle on creative sacrifice. The bell constellation as "tribute to a phantom cathedral" transforms the familiar artist-renunciation trope through concrete ritual. However, the resolution tends toward the safety middle without bold risk-taking.</comment>
