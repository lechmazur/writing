<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's internal conflict between impatience and cultivated patience drives the story with embodied contradiction ("wild animal clawing at her ribs"). The final choice to act is earned through months of patient observation, with visible cost in the "frantic drum" of her heart finally stilling into "serene and terrible" victory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the viaduct's lights dying represents freedom's arrival. Cost is legible in "the oppressive hum that had been the soundtrack to her entire life vanished." The moon-tracking method creates causal linkage to the moment of network vulnerability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen lake, basalt sanctuary, and magnetic viaduct create a coherent environment that constrains the rebellion's timing and method. The viaduct's wet sheen after rain becomes functionally critical to the resonant frequency calculation, though some details remain atmospheric rather than choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from patient observation through the moon's alignment to the single decisive action. The "harmonic key turning a cosmic lock" represents meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens, though the resolution lacks immediate personal cost beyond the release of long-held tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "patient revolution" and "restrained wildness," with the final image of mapping "not of land or sky, but of freedom" offering resonant closure. The Authority's blindness to celestial mechanics versus the rebels' ancient wisdom creates thematic depth without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevation ("scroll of frozen white," "spine of black iron") and character-specific perception focused on celestial mechanics and patience. Some register drift toward purple prose ("serene and terrible shape of victory") slightly weakens consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong sensory detail. Minor overwriting in metaphor density ("wild animal clawing," "spider-webbed," "hammer blow") and occasional elevated diction that borders on purple prose reduces propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of using moon paths to find gravitational weakness in a magnetic network offers fresh specificity. However, the rebellion-against-authority frame and patient-observer-triggers-revolution arc follow familiar patterns without significant transformation.</comment>
