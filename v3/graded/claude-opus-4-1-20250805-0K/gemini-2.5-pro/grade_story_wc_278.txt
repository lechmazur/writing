I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elian's guilt transforms into peaceful memorial.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied guilt as "low-frequency hum" and concrete choices driven by the need to silence it. The protagonist's arc from avoidance to confrontation is earned through discovered letters and the laboratory sequence. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("meteor hush" as preferred state) that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where guilt transforms to "memorial, not of guilt, but of a connection finally made peaceful" with visible cost paid through the etching ritual. The accumulative structure coheres as memory fragments build toward the laboratory confrontation. Slight opacity in the timeline between past tragedy and present, but the lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail in "city was a silent, sprawling nebula" and the amber's tactile presence. The laboratory's "cold, sterile air" and server environment effectively pressure choices. The constellation etching on metal constrains the climactic action effectively, though some middle passages lean abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from internal guilt-hum to discovering letters about Lyra, to confronting her digitized voice crying endlessly. The amber's dual function as memory-object and tool for resolution creates meaningful pressure. Cost is legible when "The hum inside him ceased" after the etching ritual completes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the amber's preserved gnat paralleling Lyra's trapped voice—both journeys halted, needing completion. The final leather memorial reweights the entire narrative from hiding to honoring. No explicit moralizing; the transformation from "scar he no longer needed to hide from" resonates without stating meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled metaphorical register ("city was a silent, sprawling nebula," "meteor hush"). Some elevated diction ("cataclysm," "dissonance") fits the contemplative POV. Minor register drift in technical passages about "haunted firmware" that slightly disrupts the lyrical tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery, though some abstract phrasing ("profound quiet that follows a cataclysm") and slight redundancy in emotional description. The phrase "ghost in their archival code" and server description maintains momentum. Some filter constructions ("he recognized," "he had to") in crucial beats reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tattoo artistry with digital ghost-hunting creates unexpected resonance. The concept of etching constellations onto server hardware to guide a lost voice home is genuinely inventive. The amber as both preservation and release tool offers non-obvious thematic depth.</comment>
