I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through layered imagery (butterflies, greenhouse, slate, ribbons) toward a resonant reconfiguration about collective grief's shape.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies believably from melancholy to obsession, with embodied details like "weight of each new name not as stone, but as silence." The grandmother's spectral presence works as internal contradiction. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract epiphany about grief as network, though it's grounded in concrete images.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias's understanding transforms how he approaches his craft, with visible cost in the abandoned personal memorial. The accumulative structure coheres through returning nightly sessions. Who/where/when anchored early. Lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains and enables the meditation through its isolation and atmosphere ("vines crawled the glass like skeletal fingers"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful. The slate and ribbons function as micro-settings that directly shape the final realization.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding collective grief) deepens through nightly returns and intensifies during the storm scene. Cost is visible in leaving the grandmother's slate unfinished as personal memorial. One meaningful deepening that changes knowledge, appropriate for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the web metaphor realized in multiple concrete forms (ghost orchid veins, ribbon threads, butterfly paths). The ending reweights prior material without stating a moral—the abstract slate becomes a new way of carving that traces continuity rather than endings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled rhythm and selective detail ("thundering calm," "sun bled across the horizon"). POV remains stable. Minor deduction for slight elevation in register during the epiphany moment that doesn't quite match Elias's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction in peak moments ("spectral mentorship," "nexus where all his grandmother's faint lines seemed to converge") creates minor register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of grief as network rather than monument offers a fresh angle on familiar material. The synthesis of gravestone carving with connection rather than endings feels earned. Specific details like the "woven ribbon roll" of collected sorrows avoid generic treatment.</comment>
