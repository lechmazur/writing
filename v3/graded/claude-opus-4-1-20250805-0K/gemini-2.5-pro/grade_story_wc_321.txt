I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is a Causal story - Finn's discovery of patterns leads him to manipulate the radio to merge timelines, with clear because/therefore linkages throughout.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Finn's motivation is clear and rooted in his "resiliently positive nature" that compels action when others freeze. His progression from observation to understanding to decisive action is well-earned. The internal consistency holds throughout, though the convenient amnesia of other characters slightly weakens the ending's psychological realism.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from ferry slipping reality → Finn's pattern recognition → radio manipulation → timeline merger. The closure (Decisive Change with merger of timelines) lands with clear cost - Finn now permanently aware of "fragile seams." The orientation anchors solidly by ~120 words, and the lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The spectral grotto with crystalline walls and alien starlight creates immediate atmospheric pressure. The environment directly constrains choice - the radio becomes the only tool, the patterns in light/frost/sound provide the solution method. The hourglass's transformation from empty to "fine, silvery sand" charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds causally: discovery of displacement → recognition of patterns → understanding of parallel timelines → active merger attempt. The dominant stake (escaping the temporal rift) tightens as Finn realizes he must merge timelines rather than simply escape. Cost is visible in his permanent awareness burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of being "caught between shores" - literally between timelines, figuratively between awareness and ignorance. The final image of Finn as guardian of reality's seams resonates without moralizing. Some thematic weight gets lost in the convenient memory-wipe of others, preventing full complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct nautical voice ("salt-stiffened jacket," "deckhand's steady hands") with controlled modulation during crisis. The perceptual signature - Finn seeing patterns others miss - is consistent and character-specific. Minor dialogue feels natural ("Bit of a close call..."), though limited presence prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean with strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery ("slide out of reality, like a bead of water skittering off a waxed leaf"). Information density is high throughout. Some metaphorical density in places ("permanent transient") but it serves the conceptual nature of the piece rather than obscuring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of a ferry worker becoming aware of parallel timelines through pattern recognition offers a fresh angle on reality-slip fiction. The specific transformation from passive observer to active timeline-weaver feels earned. However, the memory-wipe resolution and some familiar portal-fantasy elements prevent exceptional originality.</comment>
