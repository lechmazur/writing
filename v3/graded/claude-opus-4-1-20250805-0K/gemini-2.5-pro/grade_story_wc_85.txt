I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identified: Causal** - The story operates through clear because/therefore linkages: Elias helped Anya → she refused false memories → she was erased → he finds evidence → he discovers the truth → he commits to restoration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong characterization with clear guilt-driven motivation and embodied grief ("the world bleeding from blue to bruised purple"). The protagonist's transformation from trafficker to restorer is earned through discovered truth. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional language ("acidic burn of his tempered regret") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias commits to restoring Anya's memory, with clear cost (his life's work pivots from profit to penance). The causal chain holds throughout. The revelation about memory erasure effectively reweights all prior silence. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay regarding the watch hand's significance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting functions well as emotional landscape and constrains choice (the shore as specific search location). "Cobalt terrace" and driftwood shore create vivid anchors. The carved wood groove becomes a crucial sensory trigger. Deduction for some generic weather/atmosphere phrases ("waves whispered against the shingle").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal guilt to cosmic horror of complete erasure. The discovery transforms understanding and forces a new commitment. Cost is visible in Elias's complete life redirection. Minor deduction for the search sequence lacking immediate pressure until the discovery moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory as existence emerges powerfully through the concrete discovery. The "sieved hush" metaphor gains devastating meaning. The ending offers a non-literal answer about fighting erasure through reconstruction without moralizing. Strong integration of memory-work profession with thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive voice ("a sieved hush," "bleeding from blue to bruised purple"). Some elevated diction fits the genealogist character. Deduction for occasional register drift ("psychic signature," "acidic burn") and some filter-heavy passages in the middle section.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong opening and closing images. Information density is good with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for metaphor density in places ("sandpaper on bone"), some abstract emotional language, and occasional redundancy ("withheld truth...unspoken words").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory manipulation and genealogy creates original premise. The concept of total erasure from collective memory is powerful. The transformation from black market dealer to memory restorer feels earned. Minor deduction for somewhat familiar noir-genealogist archetype.</comment>
