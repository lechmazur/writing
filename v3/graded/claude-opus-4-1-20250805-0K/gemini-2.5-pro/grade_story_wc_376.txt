<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation through his yearning for authenticity drives clear choices, from assembling the map to planting the seed. The Silver-Vein fern as embodied truth-detector adds specificity. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "quiet obsession" about lost conversations that could be more viscerally grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds from dishonesty detection through map discovery to seed planting, with the Veritas Bloom as Conceptual Repricing that reweights the entire premise. Cost is visible in Elian's transformation from passive calligrapher to active cultivator. The "million tiny, truthful conversations" sprouting provides clear closure with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic sky creates immediate pressure, with details like "nutrient-paste lamps" and "bone-dry water conduits" grounding the world. The Silver-Vein fern and later Veritas seeds constrain choices meaningfully. Setting directly enables the final act of planting in manufactured soil.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal dissatisfaction through map discovery to the vault revelation, with clear deepening when Elian understands the seeds' purpose. The cost of abandoning his traditional role for cultivation is legible. One meaningful tightening through discovery suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the fern's wilting, the map's "silent repository," and culminates in the Veritas Bloom that makes "candor visible." The final image of sprouting conversations reweights all prior dishonesty without stating a moral. Strong integration of truth/authenticity throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with phrases like "sweet poison on the recycled air" and controlled rhythm that accelerates during discovery. POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature in how Elian notices decay and potential. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("breathtaking rush") that slightly exceeds the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "glass-and-steel bubble against the perpetual ochre smog." Some density issues with figurative language ("sweet poison," "quiet hope bloomed," "breathtaking rush") appearing in clusters. Template phrase "He understood everything in a sudden, breathtaking rush" reads slightly formulaic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of plants that detect/promote honesty in a post-apocalyptic greenhouse city offers fresh synthesis. The transformation from passive truth-detection (fern) to active truth-cultivation (seeds) provides non-obvious development. Specific world-building details prevent generic dystopia.</comment>
