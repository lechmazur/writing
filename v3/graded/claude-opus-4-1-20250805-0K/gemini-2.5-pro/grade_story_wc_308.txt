I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered sensory detail and resonance, with the canyon's echoes and the pulse creating a density that culminates in the final harmonic resolution.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelan's motivation is clear and embodied through patient listening and the concrete goal of consciousness-skimming. The internal shift from reverent waiting to active harmonizing is earned through the discovered arrowhead's story. Minor deduction for the hunter's backstory being somewhat generic despite its functional role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure building from listening to understanding to resolution, with the arrowhead discovery creating meaningful pressure. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Kaelan's harmonic thought releases the trapped pulse, opening the path to consciousness-navigation. Cost is legible in the hunter's eternal regret being resolved.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canyon of bone towers creates a vivid, constraining environment where every sound matters. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful - the "vertebra the size of a millstone," the rust-colored sky, the hour-long echoes. The setting directly enables the story's resolution through its acoustic properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake - learning to navigate without moving - deepens when the discordant pulse threatens the canyon's harmony. Escalation occurs through discovery, bird-reading, and harmonic resolution, each narrowing Kaelan's options toward intervention. The cost is primarily conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of releasing trapped sorrow via harmonic resonance. The story resists easy morals, instead offering a meditation on patience, understanding, and the power of witnessed grief. The final image of the path unfurling delivers thematic closure without stating its meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled, meditative rhythm matching Kaelan's patient nature. Perceptual signature strong in selective attention to sound and vibration. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("vertebra the size of a millstone") that slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("the worn leather of their trousers cracking softly") and some filter constructions that could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bone canyon acoustics with consciousness-projection creates an original world. The harmonic stone skimmer concept and the bird-reading method for understanding trapped emotions show genuine ingenuity. The resolution through harmonic thought rather than physical action demonstrates conceptual boldness.</comment>
