<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation and internal consistency are strong, with his faith in "older metrics" driving concrete actions like the marble ritual. The final choice to crack the pristine marble shows earned character arc through visible cost. Minor deduction for the manager's underdeveloped antagonism and some diagnostic self-awareness ("wisely pragmatic way") that slightly dulls authenticity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the butterflies' arrival proves Elias's thesis with visible cost (his tenure at stake). The causal lens holds throughout with strong because/therefore linkage from secret healing to present method. The final marble-cracking crystallizes victory's price and reweights the collection's meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The maze functions as active constraint shaping Elias's tactics, with sensory details (wisteria texture, rose scent, bee hum) filtered through his gardener's perception. The butterflies' selective attraction to his section charges the final image. Slightly generic in places ("thick with the scent") but the sundial and specific plant responses elevate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize early (tenure vs automation) with meaningful escalation through the statistical tie to butterfly arrival. The cost is legible—Elias risks everything on his method. Minor issue: the butterflies' arrival, while thematically earned, borders on convenient resolution despite being framed as the garden's choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the marble collection's evolution—from commemorating hidden victories to acknowledging that true triumph requires visible scars. The butterflies' preference for chaos over uniformity delivers the thematic answer without stating it. The "mended deception" motif effectively links past and present without becoming heavy-handed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("gnarled and weathered as the ancient wisteria"). Some register elevation in places ("crystallized final moment," "living wisdom") that doesn't quite match Elias's pragmatic voice. The prose modulates effectively during the judgment scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("blooming, withering grace," "river of living jewels"). Minor template cadence in the middle section with repeated "He [verb]" constructions. The marble polishing sequences achieve strong rhythm but occasional purple patches ("bled from the sky") create friction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The marble collection as memorial system is fresh and specific, transforming the garden competition trope through concrete ritual. The twist of cracking the perfect marble inverts expected symbolism effectively. Some safety in the clear moral victory limits risk-taking, though the piece commits to its quieter register.</comment>
