I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This story operates under a **Causal lens** - Kael's discovery of the shadow's origin leads to his specific method of integration, with clear because/therefore linkages throughout.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is crystal clear and rooted in love that "outlived its object," driving his meticulous approach to preserving Elara's corrupted archive. His internal contradiction between preservation and intervention plays out through concrete action - choosing integration over deletion. The final choice to embrace the shadow as part of her humanity shows earned character logic with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from discovery of corruption through diagnosis to integration, with clear closure as Kael successfully restores Elara's archive by accepting rather than erasing her trauma. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost - "The regret was a permanent resident in his heart" - though the transformation could be more viscerally dramatized. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Lumina-Arbor as "blooming library above the clouds" creates an evocative setting that directly enables the story's premise. The river stone functions as micro-setting, constraining Kael's final action as "conduit for his intent." Light-vines' wilting and revival (green to "silvery blue") embody the corruption and transformation visually.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on preserving Elara's essence without destroying her humanity. Escalation builds through Kael's discovery process - from detecting the blight to identifying its source to choosing integration over deletion. The cost is clear but somewhat abstract; the emotional price could be more immediately felt through embodied reaction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of accepting shadow as part of light - "saved not by erasing the darkness but by accepting it as the price of her light." The final image of luminous regret reweights the entire preservation effort without explicit moralizing. Subtext operates through Kael's careful methodology revealing his deep understanding of Elara.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elegance with controlled metaphoric density ("spectral light-vines," "dusk noticer"). POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature evident in Kael's attention to minute gestural differences. Some elevated diction ("solemn vow," "profound silence") occasionally drifts from character register but serves atmospheric purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery, though density of figurative language in places ("wilting in the spectral light-vines," "shadow unbound," "sliver of forgotten trauma") risks overwriting. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in "He watched... He saw... He placed..." sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of consciousness preservation with garden/cultivation metaphor creates original framework. The specific method of comparing video footage across decades to diagnose psychological corruption is inventive. Risk-taking in the quiet, technical resolution rather than dramatic confrontation serves the story's contemplative tone while maintaining stakes.</comment>
