I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered sensory detail and ritual repetition toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elias maintains the "vested hush" through musical negative space.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action - playing saxophone to counter prophetic code. His internal dread and inherited duty create genuine tension. The character lacks deeper contradiction or complexity that would elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Earned Stasis closure where Elias successfully maintains the hush with visible cost ("lonely vigil," "sorrowful beauty"). The accumulative structure coheres well through sensory layering. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The cost could be more visceral at the final moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto setting actively constrains and enables the central action - the prism atrium amplifies Elias's counter-melody, the fungi's bioluminescence creates atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("dewdrops," "stone teeth"). The environment directly participates in the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear - prevent the prophecy from manifesting. Escalation works through the musical duel between coded drips and saxophone notes. The tension deepens appropriately but lacks a sharp reversal or heightened cost that would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of "negative space" - using absence to maintain peace. The "eerie nostalgia" for an inherited duty resonates without explicit moralizing. The final image of "unscripted light" offers a non-literal answer to the central question of preservation versus change.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("pearlescent mist," "parasitic melody"). POV remains stable and modulated. Perceptual signature is strong - Elias notices through sound and light. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean with varied rhythm and strong information density. Each sentence advances atmosphere or action. Minor repetition of "careful/carefully" but no significant loops or scaffolding. Strong opening and closing lines that frame the piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of playing music through "negative space" to silence prophecy is fresh. The specific synthesis of jazz saxophone with fantasy grotto setting feels original. Execution is competent but doesn't take significant risks that would elevate further.</comment>
