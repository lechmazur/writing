I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered discovery toward a conceptual repricing about the physics of letting go.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation crystallizes through embodied discovery—the physical exploration mirrors the internal quest to understand grief's physics. The father-daughter parallel enriches without overshadowing the protagonist's arc. Minor deduction for Mortimer remaining somewhat abstract as a "silent partner" without fuller integration into the narrator's decision-making.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where the snow globe revelation reweights the entire premise—holding on creates stasis that is "its own kind of death." The physics metaphor pays off with visible cost in both the trapped girl and the narrator's "simple, final exhale." The accumulative structure coheres as each discovery builds toward this understanding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater library setting constrains exploration methods and creates atmospheric pressure that mirrors thematic weight. The preserved-yet-waterlogged books and the heat-fused strongbox provide specific tactile details. The snow globe's miniature library creates a recursive spatial element that charges the final revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative discovery: transmission source → strongbox → snow globe → father's note → conceptual understanding. Each revelation deepens rather than reverses, appropriate for the textural lens. The cost becomes legible in the father's infinite energy expenditure and the narrator's decision to leave the monument undisturbed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The physics metaphor elegantly unifies concrete exploration with abstract grief work—"conservation of momentum" becomes both scientific principle and emotional truth. The theme emerges through discovered objects rather than declaration. The final insight about letting go as "cessation of fight" resonates without moralizing, though "beautiful prison" edges toward explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Controlled academic voice suits the narrator's analytical nature, with phrases like "quietly analytic mind" and "esoteric" establishing register. Some filter-verb clustering ("I felt Mortimer's presence sharpen") and occasional register elevation in emotional beats ("gilded cage"). The address to Mortimer provides voice texture but feels slightly performative.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "Books floated in lazy suspension, their pages swollen into pale, indecipherable flowers." Some redundancy in the physics explanation paragraph and filter-verb accumulation ("I felt," "I looked"). The final paragraph contains slight paraphrase loops around the letting go concept.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The quantum sanctuary concept freshly combines hard science with emotional preservation. The underwater library as research site rather than treasure hunt offers an original angle. The physics-of-grief framework transforms familiar loss themes through specific scientific metaphor, though the Amelia Earhart frame feels somewhat ornamental.</comment>
