<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and his "infinitely patient" attribute manifests through methodical action, though internal contradiction could be stronger. The character's specialized knowledge and ritualistic approach create specificity. The final choice to return daily shows earned commitment with implied cost of time and effort.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the story builds through rhythmic layering of footsteps that resurrect spectral echoes, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence transforms from empty to "filled with promise." The ebony tuning fork anchoring the town's "true pitch" into the ground creates visible cost through permanent commitment. Structure coheres around the single walking circuit with clear who/where/when anchoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobblestones function as keys that constrain Elias's method, while specific locations (Street of Weavers, market square) guide his choreographed path. Sensory hierarchy privileges vibration and rhythm over sight, fitting the sonic restoration. The translucent baker and "spectral imprint" details make the ghost town viscerally present.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: empty footfalls gradually summon "ghosts of sound" until "whispers grew into a murmur," with the apparition of the baker marking a clear intensification. The cost manifests as hours of precise walking and tomorrow's obligatory return. Pressure coheres under the textural lens through density increase rather than causal reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of towns having "notes" and restoration happening through rhythm rather than reconstruction. The final image of maintaining balance as ongoing rhythm rather than achieved state resonates without moralizing. "Revival via the rhythm of footsteps" offers a non-literal answer to how communities resurrect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains elevated register appropriate to the cryptic bell tuner with phrases like "sculptor of echoes" and "living metronome." Perceptual signature focuses on vibration, frequency, and rhythm over visual detail. Some filter verbs ("he saw," "he knew") slightly dull immediacy in middle passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "footsteps" that serves the accumulative structure. Information density is high with lines like "each stone was a key, each scuff and tap a carefully placed piece." Minor synonym churn appears with "ghost town"/"spectral"/"phantom" cluster and some elevated diction ("infinitely patient" repeated twice) that could be tightened.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of sonic resurrection through footstep patterns offers genuine freshness, transforming the rebuild-a-town trope through specific method. The tuning fork as a tool for foundational frequencies rather than bells shows inventive restraint. Risk-taking in the quiet, ritualistic approach heightens the stakes of patient restoration.</comment>
