I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through ghostly presence, memory, and the stained glass box discovery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where shared burden transforms both Elias and Lyra's states.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's decade of silence and its motivation ("to preserve the weight of unspoken words") creates genuine internal contradiction that drives the closure. The shift from protecting memory through containment to releasing it shows earned change with visible cost—Lyra's ghostly torment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully: opening the box transforms both characters' states, with Lyra achieving "serene acceptance" and Elias no longer "astonished" or "alone." The honeycomb's "million unspoken words—not just his, but hers" reweights the entire covenant as shared burden, delivering clear cost through a year of ghostly haunting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland and "skeletal remains" of the beekeeping oasis effectively pressure choices—the dead landscape makes the ghosts' presence more haunting. The stained glass box's panels ("queen bee," "field of clover") function as compressed world-story, though some description stays ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Elias's "curdled" quietude through Lyra's "desperate focus" to the revelation that his silence has "chained her here." The deepening from personal guilt to shared burden ("not his burden alone; it was a shared anchor") meaningfully reweights the conflict's cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the honeycomb lattice containing both their unspoken words—a perfect synthesis of the beekeeping past and emotional present. The final image of Elias "no longer alone" in "quiet" silence (versus opening's "louder" silence) offers resonant closure without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with strong perceptual signature: "ghosts, shimmering in the heat haze," "phantom honey and a profound, mute eloquence." The controlled shifts between past memory and present observation serve the accumulative structure well.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("burnish the sky," "dissolving like sugar in water") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("profound miscalculation," "profound, mute eloquence"). Some abstract phrasing ("contextual clues," "symmetric satisfaction") creates minor register drift that dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The conceit of bees' souls as vessels for unspoken words offers fresh synthesis. The transformation from individual burden to shared anchor provides non-obvious insight, though some elements (ghost pointing, buried box) lean toward familiar territory.</comment>
