I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages from Elias's past failure through meeting Kestrel to learning his colleague survived and deciding to rescue her.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("heart hammered against his ribs") and clear motivation arc from guilt to renewed purpose. The transformation from "ghost" to "man running toward something" is earned through specific causality. Minor deduction for slight emotional tidiness in the resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change lands with visible cost - Elias moves from paralyzed guilt to active pursuit, with the Vienna failure explicitly reweighted as "a fracture in their shared world that he now had the chance to mend." The causal lens holds throughout with strong because/therefore linkages. Orientation anchors arrive promptly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff's mist and melting snow actively enable the secret meeting ("allies that left no records") and constrain tactics through visibility. The accumulated snow serves as communication medium. Setting doesn't quite reach higher bands as it could be another remote location with minor adjustments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal redemption to active rescue mission with the revelation "She's alive" creating genuine reversal. The Vienna network closing in adds time pressure. Cost is visible in Elias's transformation but could be more visceral at the closure moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of finding courage emerges organically through action, with the pillbox serving as physical talisman for internal journey. "It wasn't lost; it had been waiting for the right war to fight" reweights the premise effectively. The ending offers resonant answer without stating moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with selective perception ("watched a flicker of movement in the polished surface"). Some elevated diction ("ephemeral nature," "vouchsafe") slightly strains the voice under pressure. Dialogue feels natural with appropriate subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("silver hush of the mist," "gravestone" metaphor). Minor template cadence in "He'd left... He moved..." construction. Information density is solid but occasional abstract phrasing ("faithless world") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The snow-writing method and pillbox-as-contingency-plan show creativity within spy genre conventions. The reversal that the colleague survived transforms expected redemption arc. However, burned spy premise and meeting-the-handler setup follow familiar templates without radical transformation.</comment>
