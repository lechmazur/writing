<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation crystallizes through embodied perception ("dissonance snagged at the edge of his hearing") and his contradictory relationship with isolation—drawn not by misanthropy but by philosophical need. The counting ritual reveals internal method under pressure, while his final choice to witness rather than correct shows earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Elias chooses witnessing over correction, with cost visible in accepting the "beautiful flaw." The accumulative/textural lens holds through density increases ("glacier...reached into the machine") that reweight his understanding. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words with "Elias, sole shepherd of the station's hydraulic clocks."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fjord setting and hydraulic system constrain Elias's diagnostic choices through physical specifics ("obsidian razor edges," "copper pipes"). Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities—he hears pressure shifts others wouldn't notice. The ice shard's "spectrum he had never seen" charges the final image through environmental impossibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding what clocks measure) tightens through the ice discovery that forces Elias to choose between correction and witnessing. The escalation follows accumulative logic as details layer ("glacial melt, ancient and freighted") until the final reweighting. Cost appears in accepting the flaw's persistence rather than maintaining perfect function.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ice shard as message rather than malfunction—the glacier literally penetrating human measurement systems. The "shoreline where the river of geologic time met the mechanism of human measurement" offers non-literal answer to Elias's question. His grandfather's insight about clocks as "cages for a wild thing" gains resonance through the ending's acceptance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows in Elias's technical attention ("width of a spider's thread") and philosophical cast ("neat, divisible seconds of men"). Voice modulates effectively from technical precision to lyrical recognition ("world's own patient, crushing, and irresistible memory"). No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts purposefully during the counting ritual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Information density high throughout—"cathedral of brass and flowing water" does triple duty (scale/material/sacred). Syntax varies naturally between technical description and philosophical reflection. Minor repetition of "measure/measurement" in final paragraph slightly dulls impact but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The hydraulic clock station for horizon measurement offers fresh angle on time-keeping fiction. The ice shard as glacial memory reaching into human systems transforms expected malfunction narrative. Risk in making non-correction the heroic choice pays off through philosophical coherence.</comment>
