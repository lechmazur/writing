<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong ensemble characterization with clear individual voices (Anya as discoverer, Kaelen as skeptic, Elara as faithful leader) and meaningful collective arc from strangers to unified family. The ghost's altruistic motivation is consistent and drives the plot without requiring direct appearance. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("Hope was a story they told each other") rather than fully embodied states, but the final choice to trust and work together is earned through accumulated actions with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with messages building toward the resonant reconfiguration of the bell transforming the planet's magnetosphere. The closure lands with visible cost (desperate climb, physical strain) and irreversible change (clear flight path appearing). Early orientation is efficient ("dust of Xylos," "three cycles," crashed survivors) and the pattern of chalked messages teaches its logic by the first third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid world-building with "dust that tasted like rust and regret," floating rock arches, and petrified orchards creating a coherent alien landscape. The butterfly garden watering bell functions as crucial micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Setting actively pressures survival (chaotic magnetosphere blocking escape) though some descriptions trend toward the picturesque without adding pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reaching the nebula of respite) is clear from opening with meaningful escalation through discovered resources leading to the synchronized climb. The collective effort required for the final ascent forces visible trade-offs and physical risk. Agency manifests through following cryptic instructions despite doubt, culminating in Anya's desperate strike of the bell—a choice with immediate, irreversible consequences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of collective survival and trust emerging through accumulated actions rather than stated morals. The ghost's selfless guidance exemplifies sacrifice without reward, while the survivors demonstrate faith overcoming cynicism. The final "Go home" message and their transformation from strangers to family offers resonant closure without moralizing, though the theme could push further into complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited through Elara with controlled distance and selective perception (she notices the "fragile shield" of faith, traces the butterfly wings). Voice modulates appropriately from descriptive opening to urgent action during the climb. Dialogue feels natural and character-specific (Kaelen's grumbling pragmatism vs. Elara's quiet faith) though some phrasing tends toward the writerly ("bruised-purple sky").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative openings ("dust of Xylos tasted like rust and regret") and varied sentence structures. Some figurative density in places ("brambled hope," "symphony of desperation") without clear payoff, and occasional template phrasing ("As they packed their few belongings, their movements now filled with"). Information density is good with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The butterfly garden watering bell as planet-tuning device offers a fresh twist on the escape-from-hostile-planet template. The ghost communicating through chalk messages is specific and visual. However, the core premise of stranded survivors finding a way home follows familiar patterns without sufficient transformation, and some elements feel convenient (perfectly timed eclipse, single solution).</comment>
