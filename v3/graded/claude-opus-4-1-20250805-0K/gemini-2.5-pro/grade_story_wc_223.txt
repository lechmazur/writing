<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from crisis actor to witness carries genuine embodied cost through tears that "traced paths through the grime," each one tied to specific losses. Her contradictory impulses between performance and truth act simultaneously in the final confrontation. The Regent's "benevolently ruthless" nature manifests through concrete action (the chess move, the key), though her transformation feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through coded walking that builds to the UNBIND command. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the Regent unlocks the prisoner—"a sound of something immense being set free"—with visible cost in her "slow, heavy gesture." Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Great Dome's acoustic properties constrain and enable action throughout—the Regent's voice "sliding along curved marble," Elara's coded steps, the prisoner's tapping. The obsidian chessboard missing pawns charges the final image as "empty squares where the common people should have been." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through Elara's perimeter walks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: SECRET → RELEASE → UNBIND, with the Regent's recognition creating genuine tension ("recognizing a performance but unable to discern its script"). The stakes tighten when Elara knows she has "only one more chance before the Regent's benevolent ruthlessness identified her as a threat." Cost manifests in both Elara's exposed grief and the Regent's cracked composure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the chess metaphor—power without pawns—reaching resonance when Elara realizes "she was not a queen or a rook... she was a witness." The final image of "something immense being set free" offers a non-literal answer about testimony's power over authority. Subtext operates beautifully through gesture (the Regent's tremoring thumb) and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's theatrical lens—she reads gestures as performances, notices acoustics, interprets body language. Voice modulates effectively from controlled observation to raw grief. Some register elevation in "nomadic penumbra" and "benevolently ruthless" slightly strains the POV's crisis-survivor perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "a click that echoed like a breaking bone." Information density high through multi-functional lines. Some overwriting appears in the opening ("nomadic penumbra," "perpetual twilight") and occasional abstract phrasing ("luminous absence of all she had lost"). No loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surveillance state and performance art through the crisis actor turned witness. The coded walking language and acoustic gallery setting create genuine originality. The transformation of theatrical skills into resistance tactics feels earned and specific, avoiding generic dystopia tropes.</comment>
