I'll evaluate this story through a Causal drive lens, as the narrative follows clear because/therefore linkages from the journalist's call through Celeste's methodical dismantling of his false narrative.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Celeste's motivation is rooted in specific, embodied details—her father's flinch at rain, avoidance of April—that drive her intervention. The contradiction between protecting truth and protecting her father acts simultaneously in scene, particularly when she holds the pen nib while executing her plan. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "satellites of sorrow" metaphor that doesn't fully embody the emotional state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from journalist's accusation through Celeste's systematic proof by contradiction to the revelation about the uncle. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost—her father's lifelong sacrifice now legible. The "painful orbit complete" effectively reweights the opening's astronomical metaphor with earned meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting functions beyond backdrop—its isolation enables the private confrontation, the telescope and stars provide the orbital metaphor that structures meaning. The mahogany desk and locked drawer constrain access to evidence. However, the setting doesn't actively pressure choices as much as frame them.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through Celeste's three-part logical trap, each question tightening the noose around Davies's false narrative. The dominant stake—exposing truth versus protecting reputation—crystallizes when she reveals the letter. Cost is visible in her father's decades of bearing false guilt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The orbital metaphor earns its resonance by constraining perception throughout—"precarious alignment," "gravitational pull," finally "orbit complete." Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the boat named after Celeste, the specific relief fund, the brother's betrayal. The ending reweights these details without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled formality befitting an heiress conducting intellectual combat. Dialogue naturalistically captures Davies's deflation. Some register elevation in phrases like "star-dusted velvet" slightly exceeds the POV's established range during non-peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good syntactic variety and momentum. However, "the weight not of the object, but of the unwritten narrative it represented" contains unnecessary scaffolding. "A confused silence met her from the other end" uses passive construction where active would be stronger. The astronomical descriptions occasionally edge toward purple.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The proof by contradiction framework offers a fresh angle on the reveal-the-truth plot. The specific detail of the uncle as the true culprit and source transforms the expected embezzlement story. However, the protective-father-takes-blame trope, while well-executed, isn't particularly original.</comment>
