<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's theatrical narration as psychological armor against grief creates genuine complexity, and her final choice to abandon her art carries visible cost. The frozen/thawing heart metaphor drives concrete choices throughout, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("The memory, frozen for years, began to liquefy").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where abandoning the glass sphere and fleeing with only Leo's bookmark fundamentally reweights her relationship to grief—from frozen preservation to flowing acceptance. The structural integrity failure creates genuine urgency that forces this choice, with clear cost in leaving her unfinished lens behind.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned control room with its "melancholic beat" of dripping water and groaning structure actively constrains choices and forces the final abandonment. The Great Thaw's physical manifestation through structural collapse makes the setting causally essential, though some descriptions lean generic ("vast, metallic tomb").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds effectively from internal discovery (bookmark) to external crisis (structural failure) that forces immediate choice between completing her art or survival. The irony that melting threatens both renewal and destruction creates genuine tension with visible cost in the abandoned glass sphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The frozen/thawing heart concept emerges organically through concrete details—from Elara's crystalline grief to the "gentle, steady trickle of feeling" at closure. The final image of the bookmark as "fragile relic" carried forward while the perfect sphere is abandoned offers resonant complexity without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's theatrical narration creates distinctive voice ("Behold the crucible, the very heart of our enterprise"), though register occasionally elevates beyond character consistency. The performative framing device works well but sometimes strains under emotional pressure rather than naturally modulating.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, but several instances of explanatory redundancy ("The memory, frozen for years, began to liquefy, a painful, slushy ache") and occasional overwriting in metaphor density. The theatrical narration sometimes creates unnecessary scaffolding around simpler actions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The glassblower-as-artist-in-apocalypse premise offers fresh specificity, and the theatrical self-narration as grief management feels earned. However, the frozen heart metaphor, while well-executed, follows familiar emotional territory without significant transformation.</comment>
