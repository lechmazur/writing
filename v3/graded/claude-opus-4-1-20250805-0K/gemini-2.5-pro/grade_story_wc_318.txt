<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ghost protagonist's "mournfully eager" nature drives consistent choices throughout, with contradictory impulses (love/helplessness) acting simultaneously in scene. The final moment of finding "a sliver of peace" represents earned emotional movement with visible cost—his entire spectral existence poured into this single act. Minor deduction for the wife's reaction feeling slightly convenient in its precision of understanding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the leaf blower symphony building to the wife's recognition. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the "seed of healing" planted through the ghost's desperate act, with cost visible in his exhausted spiritual energy. The orientation (ghost, three seasons dead, in family home) anchors cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel constrains and enables the ghost's only method of communication, while the garage and its "forgotten projects" embody the family's stasis. Sensory detail effectively balances the mechanical roar with the phantom melody. The environment directly shapes the ghost's tactical choice and charges the final image of healing beginning in that specific acoustic space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes clear from opening: breaking the "silence so dense it felt like a physical weight." The ghost's struggle to start the leaf blower (three pulls with increasing desperation) provides meaningful escalation under the textural lens. Cost is legible in both the ghost's depleted state and the family's pained recognition—particularly the wife's "pained, fragile smile."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of using noise to restore connection, with the "true haunting not of malice, but of memory" reframing ghost story conventions. The final image of a "seed of healing" planted through mechanical cacophony offers resonant non-literal answer to how the bereaved reconnect. Subtext operates beautifully in the phantom melody beneath the engine's roar.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout—the ghost experiencing the world through "spectral fingers, more memory than matter." Voice modulates effectively from melancholic opening through desperate action to quieted resolution. Minor inconsistency in the ghost's ability to observe his family's specific reactions (frozen hands over keyboard) given his established limitations.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The two-stroke engine was cold, the plastic housing faded" establishes both time passage and emotional state. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating through the leaf blower sequence. Some redundancy in describing the ghost's emotional state ("mournful eagerness" appears twice), and occasional elevated diction ("emblems of their stagnant grief") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story with mundane suburban tool as conduit for supernatural connection. The specific choice of leaf blower as symphony instrument transforms a banal object into something profound. Risk-taking in making the haunting benevolent and the resolution deliberately incomplete ("It wasn't laughter, not yet") avoids sentiment while maintaining emotional truth.</comment>
