I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Identified: Causal** - The story follows clear because/therefore linkages: Elara must find the stairway → she uses sonic knowledge to enter → she peels layers → she discovers the truth → she places the ruby → the throne is filled.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent - using historical knowledge rather than force. The peeling sequence shows her methodical expertise, and her final choice to place the ruby carries visible stakes (system purge). Minor deduction for limited interiority during the critical discovery moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from entry to resolution, with the ruby placement creating a Decisive Change that cancels the purge. Cost is visible (millennium of cultural memory at stake). The revelation that the throne needs its "heart" not a ruler lands with conceptual weight. Minor deduction for slightly mechanical exposition of the setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hidden orchard and Palimpsest Pillar constrain Elara's choices effectively - she must peel layers to find truth. Sensory details (ozone, metallophytes, light-rivers) support the futuristic setting. The crystalline trees' energy flow shapes the climax. Slight deduction for underused waterfall after entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the layer-peeling sequence, each revealing a failed predecessor's fate, narrowing her options. The dawn deadline creates genuine pressure. The final revelation that the throne needs memory, not a body, reweights everything. Minor deduction for resolved tension dropping slightly after success.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wisdom over force, memory as sovereignty's foundation. The layered failures create a palimpsest metaphor for history itself. The ending offers a non-literal answer - power needs its heart/memory, not domination. Slight deduction for the notification text being overly explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to epic SF. POV stays controlled with Elara's scholarly perspective filtering observations ("sonic architecture," "data-codices"). Some filter verbs ("she saw," "she knew") slightly dull immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("kaleidoscopic waterfall," "rivers of light"). Information density is good - most sentences advance plot or atmosphere. Minor issues: "deeply futuristic nostalgia" strains sense; some repetitive "she [verb]" constructions in the peeling sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of throne-claiming trope - the throne needs its regulator stone, not a ruler. The palimpsest concept works well. The sonic entry method and data-preservation stakes feel specific. Doesn't quite reach higher bands due to some familiar SF elements (AI overlord, system purge).</comment>
