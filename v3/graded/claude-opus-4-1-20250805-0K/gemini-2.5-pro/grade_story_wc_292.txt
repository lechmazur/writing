<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in family legacy, driving him through escalating discoveries with consistent internal logic. His "nervous confidence" manifests in concrete actions like the cliff-edge metaphor and trembling hand pressing the nail. The transformation from nervous to confident in the final paragraph feels earned through accumulated proof, though some interior phrasing ("spongey dread," "clean bright fire") edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage drives the plot: discovery of journals leads to decoding poems, which reveals location, which uncovers truth, which enables reversal of exile. The Decisive Change lands with clear cost—Eva's century of erasure and Elias's inherited burden. The reversible exile concept effectively reframes the entire narrative from failure to conspiracy, though the magical "cartographical curse" mechanism strains credibility slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The weather station's oppressive atmosphere ("heavy air," "grey water," "mildew") effectively mirrors and pressures Elias's emotional state. The micro-vortex and climate data serve as crucial plot mechanisms rather than decoration. The copper nail functions as both setting detail and key object, though some descriptions ("spongey dread" repeated twice) feel forced rather than organic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal vindication to exposing a century-long conspiracy about a hidden continent. The pressure tightens as each discovery narrows Elias's path toward confronting the Guild. The cost is visible—Eva's erasure from history and the weight of reversing it—though the final confrontation happens off-page via "secure channel" rather than dramatized scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of buried truth versus institutional control emerges organically through Eva's story without explicit moralizing. The copper nail transforms from memento to key, effectively linking death and resurrection motifs. The ending reweights the opening's "spongey dread" as purposeful suppression rather than atmosphere, though the "clean bright fire" metaphor feels slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent scholarly precision appropriate to a map librarian, with selective perception focused on documents, weather patterns, and cartographic details. The prose modulates effectively from analytical cross-referencing to visceral discovery ("heart hammering"). Some phrases feel artificially elevated ("salt-tongue licks the stone") though they're justified as Eva's poetry rather than Elias's voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong information density—most sentences advance plot, atmosphere, or character simultaneously. The "spongey dread" repetition and some abstract metaphors ("clean bright fire of confidence") create minor friction. Sentence variety is adequate, though several constructions follow similar patterns ("He felt...", "He found...", "He read...").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The reversible exile concept offers a fresh take on historical erasure—not just reputation but magical removal from reality itself. The synthesis of climate change, cartography, and family legacy creates unexpected resonance. The poetry-as-map device feels earned rather than gimmicky, though the magical realism element isn't fully integrated with the otherwise grounded world.</comment>
