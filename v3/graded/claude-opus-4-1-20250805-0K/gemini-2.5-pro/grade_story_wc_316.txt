I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric with precision.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This story operates under a **Causal lens** - Kael's actions follow because/therefore linkages leading to the vivification of the duplicate brain, with each step narrowing his options toward the final act of creation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's emotional numbness and desperate curiosity drive consistent, high-stakes choices throughout. The contradiction between his void state and memory of former passion creates genuine internal conflict acted out through the vivification ritual. Minor deduction for Jin's somewhat stock opposition role, though his fear reads as authentic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change lands with visible cost - Kael transforms the duplicate brain into conscious life while experiencing his first crack in emotional numbness. The causal chain from numbness to curiosity to action to responsibility holds perfectly. The creation succeeds but brings "terrifying sense of responsibility" as immediate on-page cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo with temporal static below creates atmospheric pressure while the glass jar serves as crucial micro-setting constraining choice. Sensory details like "dust motes danced in slanted light" and "whisper of wood on wood" are selective and purposeful. The environment doesn't quite reach full constraint on the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The clone custody battle escalates from verbal disagreement to Jin's attempted interference to Kael's decisive action, with clear cost in draining sensation and new responsibility. Kael's agency drives the vivification against Jin's opposition. The stakes tighten once as Jin moves to physically intervene, forcing immediate action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of creation through opposites - Kael must channel both his void and phantom emotions to create new life. The final image of responsibility cracking numbness's foundation offers resonant answer to whether healing requires reclamation or creation. No explicit moralizing; complexity preserved through Jin's legitimate fear.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent POV throughout. Prose rhythm modulates effectively during the vivification sequence. Dialogue between Kael and Jin carries subtext well - "You are afraid of what it might become" cuts through pretense as promised.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "dust motes danced" opening and varied sentence structure. Some elevated diction ("profound emotional numbness," "complementary opposites") occasionally drifts from Kael's established register. Information density high; most sentences advance multiple story elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ego death survivor creating new consciousness from a duplicate brain offers fresh angle on identity/healing themes. The vivification through paradoxical opposites and temporal static setting provide original texture. Somewhat limited by familiar master-student dynamic, though fear versus curiosity adds specificity.</comment>
