I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara's shadow-eclipse transforms the Orrery.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is embodied through "familiar ache" and "quiet obsession that hummed beneath her ribs," with her lunar-eclipse heritage meaningfully constraining her solution. The mirror reflections showing "countless Elaras... some triumphant, most failing" create genuine internal tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "rhythm of repair" which could be more concretely embodied in the early beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the eclipse-shadow reveals the keyhole and transforms the frozen Orrery into "warm and golden" light with "the sound of healing." The cost is visible in the consumed eclipse essence ("last true eclipse") and the mirror's dissolution of false possibilities. The accumulative lens holds as patterns of light/shadow and repair build toward this transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen library setting actively constrains through "crystalline stasis" and the "hauntingly bright" ice that blinds with overlapping failures. The Orrery's physical details and the visceral "obsidian glass, so dark it seemed to drink the light" create strong sensory anchoring. Setting directly enables the shadow-solution through its oppressive brightness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from general repair obsession through the mirror's psychological pressure ("silent screams trapped") to the decisive moment of uncapping the irreplaceable eclipse essence. The "last true eclipse" creates genuine scarcity and cost. The blinding light that "refracts possibilities into an unbearable, overlapping cascade of failure" effectively raises pressure through environmental constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lunar-eclipse/shadow-key revelation: "some mechanisms only yield to the precise application of a shadow." The transformation from "hauntingly bright frost" to "warm and golden" light resonates beyond plot mechanics. The final image of "driftwood nostalgia... joined by the quiet, powerful harmony of a purpose fulfilled" offers a non-literal answer about repair requiring acceptance of darkness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through phrases like "water-smoothed wood held in the hand" and "perpetual twilight that promised a dawn." The perceptual signature shows in how Elara processes the mirrors ("not her image but fractured echoes"). Slight register elevation in "meshing metal, a sound that broke a silence centuries deep" fits the climactic moment without breaking voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative phrases like "liquid shadow" and "tiny, perfect void." Information density is high, particularly in the eclipse-shadow sequence. Minor issues: "whose lineage named her" is slightly awkward construction; "tired woman watching a miracle of her own making" veers toward telling what could be more embodied. No loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith concept freshly synthesizes shadow-work with mechanical repair, avoiding fantasy clichés. The "absent light" as key and the obsidian vial containing eclipse essence show genuine invention. The mirror hall reflecting failed possibilities rather than simple alternates adds psychological depth. Risk-taking in the lyrical register and conceptual fusion elevates within band.</comment>
