I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through sensory detail and memory toward a resonant reconfiguration where Anya chooses to continue her care despite trauma.

<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Anya's PTSD response is exceptionally embodied through specific somatic details ("ice bloomed in her stomach," "jaw tightened, a hard knot of muscle"). The contradiction between her paralysis and her need to continue working creates genuine tension. Her final choice to water the pine despite everything shows earned endurance with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Earned Stasis—Anya's choice to continue caring for the trees despite triggered trauma forecloses the path of surrender with clear cost. The accumulative build from present calm through triggered memory to grounded return works cohesively. The final image of giving "just enough" water resonates as both literal care and metaphor for measured hope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The arboretum setting actively constrains choice—the glass walls create both sanctuary and trap when the plane passes. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered ("grit of soil under her thumbnail," "scent of damp earth and pine resin"). The Wollemi pine as living fossil mirrors Anya's survival, though this could be pushed further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The plane's shadow creates immediate physical paralysis that escalates through memory to the photograph's tactile presence. Anya's grounding technique shows agency through attention rather than action. The cost is viscerally felt in her body's rebellion and the effort required to return to function.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between ancient trees surviving catastrophe and Anya's daily choice to cultivate despite trauma. The phrase "anchoring optimism in realism" gains depth through dramatization rather than assertion. The ending's "just enough" water subtly answers the question of how much hope to risk.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in how Anya notices botanical details versus the "cold and regular pulse" of technology. The shift from controlled observation to fragmented sensation during the trigger ("high, thin whine") to deliberate grounding shows masterful psychic distance modulation. Voice maintains consistency even under extreme stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The paper was soft as cloth from years of being clenched in a fist"). Some figurative density in the trigger sequence ("ice bloomed," "spreading outward") serves the accumulative pattern. Minor repetition of "anchor" could be tightened.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The integration of PTSD with botanical care offers a fresh angle on trauma survival. The specific detail of the wedding photograph worn soft creates originality through particular texture. The Wollemi pine as survivor of ice ages adds conceptual depth, though the lighthouse keeper reference feels slightly ornamental.</comment>
