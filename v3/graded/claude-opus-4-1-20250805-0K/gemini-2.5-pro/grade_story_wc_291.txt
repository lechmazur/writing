I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered oppositions (quarry/mist, ribbon/stone, joy/despair) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elias's empathy awakens through the artwork's completion.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's prosopagnosia creates a compelling, specific motivation that drives his unconventional method. The internal contradiction between his "selfish and desperate reason" and the empathy he seeks plays out through concrete artistic choices, particularly in the violent scratch that completes the portrait. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "shape of existence" phrasing that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias's empathy awakens "not by a face, but by the true and terrible shape of its absence" - the cost is felt in his "sharp, aching sorrow." The accumulative structure coheres through consistent opposition-unifying that builds to the decisive scratch. Orientation is clear by ~100 words (quarry, Elias, cold case investigation through art).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quarry functions as both setting and metaphor - "a wound in the earth" that mirrors the victim's wound and Elias's emotional void. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (cold mist clinging, scrape of charcoal, damp sigh of wind). The setting constrains his artistic process and charges the final image where painting faces fog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (awakening empathy) escalates through accumulating artistic oppositions until the violent scratch creates the breakthrough moment. Cost is visible in the "sharp, aching sorrow" and the permanence of leaving the painting "to stare into the fog." The tension between methodical process and desperate need creates authentic pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of seeing without faces - understanding essence through absence. The unification of opposites (festive silk/unforgiving stone, geometric gray/vibrant life) creates resonance without stating a moral. The final image of the painting staring into fog offers a non-literal answer about how empathy can emerge from structural understanding rather than facial recognition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled, formal register matching Elias's methodical nature. POV remains stable with appropriate perceptual filtering through his condition. Rhythm modulates effectively from deliberate process description to the sharp breakthrough moment. Minor deduction for slight elevation in diction ("fatal interaction," "irreconcilable forces") that occasionally drifts from character register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm and clear momentum. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some elevated diction ("prosopagnosia," "irreconcilable forces") creates minor register drift. The violent scratch moment demonstrates excellent syntactic control. Slight redundancy in explaining the void/absence connection reduces score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prosopagnosia angle offers a fresh perspective on portrait art and empathy. The method of painting through oppositions rather than faces is distinctive. However, the cold case investigation frame is somewhat familiar, and the revelation mechanism (artistic breakthrough leads to emotional awakening) follows recognizable patterns despite specific execution.</comment>
