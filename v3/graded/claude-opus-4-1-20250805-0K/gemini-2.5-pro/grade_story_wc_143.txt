<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelen's purposeful curiosity drives him to transgress company protocols, creating genuine internal tension between duty and grandfather's legacy. The final beat shows him carrying "a beautiful ache that would linger," earning the emotional cost through his witnessing of extinction rather than declaring it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through ritual preparation, chemical timing, and photographic documentation to a Resonant Reconfiguration where beauty and extinction converge. The Silene Flora's sublimation under sunlight delivers visible cost—"The magic was gone"—while Kaelen's internalized "beautiful ache" provides felt cost that reweights his purposeful curiosity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The moonlit summit functions as more than backdrop—its "cold so profound it made the suit's internal heaters groan" constrains timing, while the regolith's crunch and the "barren horizon" create isolation that charges the Flora's appearance. The crystalline organisms' "fractal patterns of light" against "dead rock" maximizes contrast between life and sterility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal rebellion through chemical timing to the irreversible moment when "the first true ray of sunlight sliced across the summit like a blade." The Flora's instant sublimation forecloses any second chance, making Kaelen's vigil and documentation matter absolutely.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The extinct-bloom-as-legacy theme emerges through concrete particulars—the nightwatch grain, the Hasselblad camera, the Flora's century-stored starlight—without declaration. The final image of beauty "seared behind his eyes" reweights the opening's "quiet rebellion" into profound witness-bearing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters the summit through Kaelen's technical-poetic consciousness: "a dawning hush fell over the landscape, a palpable, vibrating stillness." Minor register elevation in "ethereal" and "impossible blue" slightly exceeds the established voice but doesn't harm closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "the camera's shutter a soft, reverent *thump-clack* in the vacuum of his helmet" conveys action, emotion, and physics simultaneously. Some elevated diction ("ethereal," "sublime") creates mild register drift but prose remains propulsive through the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of extinct crystal-organisms blooming once per century witnessed through forbidden grandfather-legacy photography creates a non-obvious intersection. Risk-taking in the quiet, melancholic ending that refuses resolution heightens emotional stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
