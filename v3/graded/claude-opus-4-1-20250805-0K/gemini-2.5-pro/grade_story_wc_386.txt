<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "salvage something pure from the wreckage" drives concrete actions through dream-diving and truth-weaving, with the boy's release providing earned closure. The man's phantom shows believable self-deception ("It was an accident" repeated until almost true), though his villainy could use more nuance. Internal conflict operates through Elara's "delicate art" requiring careful truth-weaving rather than accusation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through dream fragments to the shared dreamscape confrontation, with the boy's smile and snow globe shake providing Resonant Reconfiguration with clear emotional cost. The melted globe transforms from "prison" to "memorial," and the boy's release carries felt weight. Causality holds as Elara's gathering of dream cameos enables the final confrontation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ice shrine with "walls weep history" and "blue, million-year-old cold" creates vivid atmosphere that mirrors the frozen trauma. The melted snow globe serves as both anchor and constraint for Elara's work. The dream-ocean and research outpost settings effectively pressure the confrontation, though some descriptions edge toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from detecting the boy's appearances to exposing the man's obstruction to achieving the boy's release. Elara's agency drives the progression through creating the shared dreamscape. The confrontation carries weight but resolution comes somewhat easily once truth is revealed—more resistance from the man would strengthen the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of salvaging truth from wreckage, with the melted/perfect snow globe duality embodying corrupted versus preserved innocence. The final transformation from "prison" to "memorial" offers resonant non-literal answer about witnessing and release. "Borrowed starlight" subtly suggests how truth emerges through collective consciousness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical register ("wreck-diver of a peculiar sort," "dream-ocean") maintains consistency. POV control is strong with Elara as psychic observer in dreamscapes. Some elevated diction ("epicenter of sorrow," "fractured memory crying out") occasionally drifts from the established mystical-practical voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("walls weep history"), but some overwriting appears ("fractured memory crying out for witness," "human eclipse"). Template phrasing emerges in exposition ("For weeks, it has been broadcasting"). Information density is good but uneven—the confrontation scene could be more concise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story with dream-diving creates original angle on witnessing trauma. The ice shrine setting and dream-ocean navigation offer specific texture. While "exposing hidden truth about a death" is familiar territory, the psychic archaeology method and snow globe symbolism provide distinctive execution.</comment>
