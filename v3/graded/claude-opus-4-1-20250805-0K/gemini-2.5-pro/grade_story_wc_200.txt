<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation as "spiritual midwife" who integrates laughter into healing is clear and drives his specific approach to the spirit. The spirit's arc from anguished musician to peaceful luminescence through recovered joy memory earns its resolution. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("modestly fearless acceptance") and the spirit's transformation feeling slightly swift, though the tavern memory provides concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the spirit dissolves into light after confessing joy rather than pain, with visible cost in her decades of gray twilight. The piece teaches its pattern early (sonic pursuit through spiritual acoustics) and pays it off when laughter untangles the distorted melody. Orientation anchored by line 50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Echo Gorge's acoustics constrain Silas's method—he must "pursue the spirit through the very structure of its sonic despair." Sensory detail is selective (mist coiling, distorted harp notes as "shards of agony") and the crocodile tooth anchors him to physicality. The spectral harp's transformation from broken to golden-threaded directly shapes closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from distorted notes to "painful shriek" when Silas first speaks, then resolve through the spirit's recovered laughter memory that untangles the melody. The dominant stake—helping the spirit move on by confessing joy not just pain—tightens when she initially recoils. Cost is visible in her "decades in gray twilight" and the "luminous ache" of Silas's work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that souls need to "confess joy" alongside pain to become whole—demonstrated through the spirit's transformation when she recalls laughter. The tavern memory with the drunkard and pies provides specific embodiment rather than abstraction. Minor deduction for "Music is not just notes and scales" edging toward explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("a river of mist coiled between canyon walls"). Dialogue serves dual purpose—Silas's gentle questions both reveal his method and trigger the spirit's transformation. Some elevated diction ("spectral confession of pure grief") fits the otherworldly subject but occasionally distances.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence lengths and purposeful imagery ("Each chord was a shard of agony, beautiful but broken"). Information density is high—most lines advance both atmosphere and plot. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("modestly fearless acceptance") and some predictable constructions in the middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of healing souls through laughter rather than just processing grief offers a fresh angle on psychopomp stories. The specific detail of the drunken tavern memory falling into pies creates authentic particularity. Transformation of the familiar soul-collector trope is competent but doesn't fully escape genre expectations.</comment>
