I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and ritual description toward a resonant final image rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as keeper of final moments is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like "fingers tightened around the emerald chip" and the specific memory of "sunlight on a child's face." The character's unique method of finding patterns in static chaos demonstrates consistent traits under pressure, though internal contradiction could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara completes her ritual and adds the captured memory to her collection, with visible cost in the soul's dissolution ("The shimmering outline on the obsidian slab was gone, its last echo spent"). The accumulative structure coheres as density increases through the infusion sequence, teaching its pattern early and paying off with the lotus locket's closing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The crystalline grotto with aurora veils creates immediate atmosphere, and spatial details like "polished obsidian slab" and "velvet-lined niches" ground the action. The emerald chip functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables the central choice of capturing the memory, directly charging the final image of "preserved beauty of a thousand last sparks."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of capturing "one last spark before the end" is signaled early and tightens through Elara's focused search for "the one true note" amid cosmic static. The pressure deepens as she narrows focus to extract the specific memory, with visible cost in the soul's complete dissolution, though additional complication could strengthen escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of beauty in death work—"not to mourn its passing but to honor it"—without explicit moralizing. The final image of preserved memories as "tiny suns" against "endless night" offers a non-literal answer about finding meaning in transience, with the lotus locket providing resonant closure imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "lucidly watchful" and "felt its vibrations against her consciousness" creates a meditative voice appropriate to the ritual. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance, though some phrases like "sacred duty" edge toward slight elevation that could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "liquid light, a current of warmth and gold that met the cool green of the gem," though some elevated diction ("radiant hush," "ceaseless dance") accumulates without full payoff. Minor template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions but information density remains solid throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The beautician-mortician concept working with consciousness rather than bodies offers a fresh angle on death work, and the specific method of extracting memories from cosmic static feels original. The synthesis of craft and spirituality through gem-infusion creates memorable specificity, though some imagery borders on familiar fantasy tropes.</comment>
