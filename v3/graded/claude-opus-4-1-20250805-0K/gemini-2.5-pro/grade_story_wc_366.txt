<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to protect crystallizes powerfully when the light fails, transforming from routine into desperate need. The internal contradiction between his reticent nature and his compulsion to save the keeper lands with genuine emotional weight. Minor deduction for the keeper remaining abstract despite the intimacy established through their stone/note exchange.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Silas assumes the keeper's watch, paying visible cost through loss and acceptance. The stone circle as "farewell" and "the light is safe" delivers emotional and practical resolution with earned weight. The sea glass held to the beam recharges all prior exchanges with luminous grief.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse, stone stairs, and lantern room constrain Silas's choices throughout, from the dangerous crossing to the mechanical repair. Sea glass and stones function as micro-settings that shape communication and closure. The "haunted lantern room" transforms from legend to embodied loneliness, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine supply run to desperate rescue when the light fails, with the storm amplifying physical danger. Silas's agency drives every beat from choosing to cross dangerous seas to fixing the mechanism. Cost is visible in the keeper's absence and Silas's acceptance of the watch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the stone/note exchange system—connection maintained through distance and silence. The final realization that "the ghost was just loneliness after all" reweights the entire relationship without moralizing. The sea glass holding "all the light and all the ache in the world" delivers resonant closure without stating meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with maritime precision ("supply skiff," "Fresnel lens") and selective perception focused on navigation and mechanical detail. POV maintains appropriate modesty about the unseen keeper. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in "luminescent ache filled Silas's chest" that briefly exceeds the established taciturn voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clean, purposeful prose with strong momentum through the storm sequence. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for occasional overwriting ("absolute, terrifying darkness," "oppressive quiet") and one paraphrase loop ("The lamp had flickered out" following the visual description of the same event).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh angle on lighthouse keeper isolation through the stone-message system, which feels specific and earned. The transformation of "haunted" from supernatural to emotional loneliness offers genuine insight. Slightly conventional in the storm-rescue framework, though executed with strong particulars.</comment>
