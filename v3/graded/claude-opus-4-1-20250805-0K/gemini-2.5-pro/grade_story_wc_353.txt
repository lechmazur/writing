<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's deafness driving her to "create music in a silent world" establishes clear, embodied motivation that intensifies through discovering the Old One's stress-crack "score." The final choice to release stored histories through empathetic pressure shows contradictory impulses (imposing vs. releasing) acting in scene with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("symphonically minded brain") that edges toward label-speak without full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered tree-voices building to symphonic resonance. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: "The world was no longer quiet. It was listening" reweights the opening silence with felt transformation cost. The Old One's stress cracks as "autobiography of tension" provides the persistent constraint that shapes Elara's method throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator as tool and the stress cracks as readable score constrain Elara's choices throughout, with vivid sensory work ("cool air that followed the season's first uncurling hedgehog"). The grove functions as active setting where each tree's physical history determines its sonic potential. Environment directly shapes the final symphonic image through accumulated tree-voices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: single note (C) → perfect fifth (G) → shifting chord → full breathing symphony, with each addition narrowing Elara's path toward releasing rather than imposing sound. The cost manifests in "filling the hollow space the silence had carved" - her deafness transformed into conducting ability. One meaningful deepening that forecloses the path of imposed melody.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that trees contain "autobiography of tension" - their struggles become music when released with empathy rather than force. The final image of the world "listening" offers resonant answer to the opening silence without stating a moral. Minor deduction for "empathy in motion" appearing as slight prompt-echo, though it's well-integrated through specific action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of experiencing sound as "texture without melody" and reading stress cracks as musical scores. Prose modulates effectively from contemplative opening to active conducting sequence. Some filter verb clustering ("she realized," "she felt") in middle section slightly dulls immediacy without being voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good information density and varied sentence structures. The metaphor system (trees as orchestra, cracks as score) remains coherent throughout. Deduction for paraphrase loop: "not imposing a melody, but releasing the one already captured" restates the same revelation twice. Minor template cadence in "She moved...She was..." sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of a deaf sculptor creating symphonies through reading tree stress as musical notation offers genuine freshness. The porcelain insulator repurposed from power lines to conduct sound shows inventive specificity. Slight deduction for "empathy in motion" reading as mild prompt-response rather than fully organic emergence.</comment>
