I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through rhythmic patterns, sensory accumulation, and a final resonant reconfiguration where the reef's periodic return reweights Aris's purpose.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is concrete and embodied through his rhythmic tapping obsession, with contradictory impulses (desperate need vs. methodical patience) acting simultaneously. The final renunciation of drift for purpose is earned through prior causality. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("desperate need to understand") in establishing beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong resonant reconfiguration: the reef's temporal return transforms Aris from drifting to moored-with-purpose, with visible cost (years of isolation). The accumulative structure coheres through rhythmic patterns building to the revelation. Minor deduction for slightly delayed cost articulation—the "periodically eternal" concept could land harder in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The station as concrete anchor and the dead reef as recurring constraint effectively shape choices throughout. The rhythmic tapping on metal surfaces functions as micro-setting that enables the final transformation. Deduction for some generic marine descriptions ("vast, indifferent blue") that don't fully leverage POV specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating rhythmic attempts, environmental confluence, and the discovered spiral notation, narrowing to the final successful summoning. The cost (years of isolation, accepting periodic rather than permanent access) is legible. Minor deduction for the convenience of the environmental alignment timing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of periodic eternality versus permanent loss emerges organically through the reef's transformation and Lena's method. The final image—touching eternity from a fixed mooring point—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Strong integration of memory/presence duality throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through marine scientist's technical attention and rhythmic obsession. Clean psychic distance management. Deduction for occasional register elevation ("skeletal monument," "phantom limb of the world") that slightly exceeds the established voice under non-peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("bled into the horizon," "ghost of that reef"). Information density is solid with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for metaphor density in non-pattern-taught moments and occasional elevated diction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of ecological grief with temporal mechanics through rhythm-based summoning is fresh. The transformation of monitoring from passive observation to active resurrection offers a non-obvious angle. Slight deduction for the somewhat familiar "lost love's research" frame.</comment>
