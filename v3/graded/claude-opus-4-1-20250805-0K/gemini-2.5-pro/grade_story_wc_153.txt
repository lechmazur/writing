I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and symbolic resonance rather than strict causality, culminating in a pattern break that reweights understanding.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied characterization through "skin around her eyes bruised with shadow" and Elara's physical depletion after evocation. Kael's transformation from "quiet desperation" to "shattering understanding" is earned through the witnessed memory, with visible emotional cost in his silent weeping. The "fierce tenderness" of Elara's craft shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - Kael achieves "shattering understanding of why he had taken it" with clear emotional cost. The accumulative structure coheres as spirit voices, condensation messages, and memory fragments build toward the revelation "a surplus of fear" that reframes his past choice. Orientation anchors established early (mangrove labyrinth, stilt-hut, Elara as medium).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth functions as more than setting - its "temporal stillness heavy with ghosts of words" constrains the evocation ritual. Vivid sensory detail ("air thick as unsent letter's ink") filtered through Elara's professional perception. The gargoyle shard serves as both tool and anchor, its coldness shocking the humid pane to enable the message.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding "the moment before deciding") established early and deepens through the evocation sequence. The escalation from spirits' murmur to "keening hymn" to message formation creates coherent pressure. Kael's final understanding carries visible cost - not regret for the path taken but painful truth about fear over love.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken apologies and unsent communications emerges organically through concrete details - the spirits carrying "weight of what was never said," messages forming in condensation, the final word "sorry" dissolving. The ending reweights the opening's "space where an apology waits unspoken" - the apology remains unsent but "silence it occupied was now filled with painful, luminous truth."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled metaphorical register ("tidal pull of memory," "voices like stones rubbing together underwater"). Perceptual signature maintained - Elara notices through her medium's lens while maintaining psychic distance. Brief dialogue serves its purpose; free indirect style clean when rendering Kael's witnessed memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, though occasional overwriting ("painful, luminous truth"). Information density high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some metaphorical density in opening paragraph borders on excessive but serves accumulative mode. The "ferocity of the evocation" phrase feels slightly forced.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of séance tradition with specific details - gargoyle rainspout shard as tool, messages in window condensation, mangrove setting with singing spirits. The concept of navigating to "the moment before deciding" offers non-obvious angle on regret. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and symbolic density mostly succeeds.</comment>
