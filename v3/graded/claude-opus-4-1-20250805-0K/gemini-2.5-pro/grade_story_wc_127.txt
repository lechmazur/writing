<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's internal contradictions between professional detachment and empathetic absorption play out through embodied sensation ("cold, dense stone" settling in his chest). The final choice to absorb sorrow as "the price of his craft" shows earned renunciation with visible cost, though some interiority edges toward explanatory rather than purely experiential.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through layered sensory detail toward Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael accepting the emotional residue as his burden. Cost is explicit: "leaving the sorrow behind as a residue in his own soul." Orientation anchors (amber grotto, Kael, fragrance work) establish by ~50 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber grotto's "resonant crystals" provide the baseline hum against which Kael works, while the "thick, honeyed layers" mirror the emotional preservation he performs. Setting constrains method (the grotto's specific resonance enables the static sensing) though some descriptions remain decorative rather than fully pressurizing choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes build through textural accumulation—from sensing the petal's charge to absorbing both halves of memory to the final separation. The dominant stake (crafting the half-truth) tightens when Kael realizes "to want one without the other was to want a flower without roots," forcing his sacrifice, though escalation could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central paradox of authentic forgery—Kael must fully experience genuine emotion to create its counterfeit. The final image of him decanting joy while retaining sorrow offers a non-literal answer about the cost of empathy without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through technical precision ("positive charge of shared laughter, a bright, popping energy") and synesthetic rendering of emotion as electricity. Voice maintains controlled distance even during absorption, though occasional phrases like "quiet, obsessive need" edge toward telling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong sensory precision and varied syntax, particularly in the transfer sequence. Minor redundancies ("This was the delicate part, the separation" followed by explanation) and some filter constructions ("He could feel") slightly dull immediacy but don't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of emotion-as-electrical-charge offers fresh specificity, and the professional ethics of a counterfeit dealer who must experience truth creates non-obvious tension. Some elements (amber grotto, fragrance chemistry) feel slightly derivative of fantasy conventions but are transformed through precise sensory work.</comment>
