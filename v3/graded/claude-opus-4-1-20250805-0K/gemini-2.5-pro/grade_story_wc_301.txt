<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("sandpaper against his nerves") and contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (methodical search vs. desperate belief). The protagonist's choice to leave the accordion behind represents genuine change with visible cost. Minor deduction for the graffiti wisdom arriving as convenient external catalyst rather than emerging from character-driven discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—protagonist reframes his relationship to guilt through the graffiti's conceptual repricing. Cost is visible in leaving the father's accordion behind. Deduction for the graffiti appearing as deus ex machina wisdom without sufficient setup, though the closure lands effectively with "leaving the weight of his father's music behind."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail ("thick shroud of ivy," "scent of damp earth and decay") with the accordion functioning as micro-setting that constrains choice. The station effectively pressures the protagonist toward his realization. Setting directly shapes the final choice to leave the accordion, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) signaled early with meaningful deepening through the graffiti discovery that reweights his understanding. The accordion's wheezing notes represent acceptance rather than resolution. Cost is legible in abandoning the father's instrument, though the graffiti's arrival lacks causal buildup.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the map/territory metaphor realized in scene rather than stated. The graffiti's message reweights all prior mapping behavior without moralizing. Strong resonance in "leaving the weight of his father's music behind so he could finally begin to listen for his own," though slightly convenient in its perfect articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with selective attention to decay and damage reflecting internal state. Controlled psychic distance shifts effectively during the accordion moment. Minor deduction for the graffiti's voice feeling disconnected from the established narrative texture—its wisdom arrives too cleanly articulated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition ("breath in and a breath out"). Information density high throughout. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("nadir of his chart," "desperate logic of the un-numbed") and the graffiti's message reading as authorial intrusion rather than organic discovery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mapping/grief with specific details (accordion with duct tape, railway station setting). The map/territory insight offers genuine reframing. However, the graffiti wisdom feels derivative of common philosophical tropes, and its convenient appearance reduces originality despite strong execution elsewhere.</comment>
