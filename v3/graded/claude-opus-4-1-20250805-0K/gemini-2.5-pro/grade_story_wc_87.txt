<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal contradiction between sea-longing and land-bound guilt drives genuine conflict, with embodied details like "trembling hand" and the compass as "judge and jury." The final choice to face the sea with "broken tool" and "flickering faith" shows earned progression with visible cost. Minor deduction for slight abstractness in "align heart and action" phrasing that edges toward therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through utility poles → compass → facing the sea, with Resonant Reconfiguration closure as Elias turns toward water for "the first time in a year." Cost is legible in "broken tool" and "flickering faith" but could be sharper. The navigation error backstory effectively anchors present paralysis though approaches the 20% reflection limit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Coastal setting with salt/brine sensory detail and utility poles as navigation system creates specific world. The kayak launch and "bruised twilight sky" effectively frame the liminal space. Setting constrains choice through the water's edge as boundary between past/future, though could push harder on physical constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reconciling with the sea after navigation failure is clear, with one meaningful deepening as Elias moves from avoidance to facing water. Cost visible in "flickering faith" and accepting his "broken" status, though the tightening could be more decisive. The young couple's kayak provides contrast but doesn't significantly escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of broken expertise and the cost of perfectionism emerges through concrete details: the navigation error, utility poles as "earthbound certainty," and compass as offering. The final image of facing the sea with broken tools resonantly answers whether redemption requires perfection. Slight deduction for "align heart and action" edging toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with nautical lexicon ("keel broken," "celestial sphere") and rhythm that modulates from longer contemplative sentences to shorter decisive ones at closure. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. The "merrily melancholic" funeral dirge effectively captures character's sardonic self-awareness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density strong in lines like "His life was a vessel beached at the precise moment when expectations collapse." Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "He [verb]" structures and slight overwriting in metaphor density ("blazing sun"/"flickering candle").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh angle on maritime guilt through the specific detail of terrestrial navigation by utility poles versus celestial navigation. The "merrily melancholic" funeral dirge and broken navigator who still approaches water show originality. Some familiar territory in redemption arc structure limits higher scoring.</comment>
