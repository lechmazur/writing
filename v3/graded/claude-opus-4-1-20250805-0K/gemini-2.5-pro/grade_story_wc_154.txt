<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal conflict between professional distance and empathetic connection drives authentic choices, particularly his decision to translate emotional rather than strategic information. The General's transformation from commander to father is earned through specific embodied moments—the "subtle, sharp motion in his throat"—rather than declaration. Minor deduction for the coral fragment serving more as backstory anchor than active constraint on present choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the General's recognition of shared vulnerability forecloses his armored stance, with cost visible in his swallow and gesture shift. The accumulative lens holds as Elias builds meaning through translating symbols into emotional truths that reweight the conflict's scale. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, and the coral fragment effectively anchors Elias's motivation without excess backstory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mist against glass creates effective visual boundary between inside/outside worlds, while the "sterile" atrium contrasts meaningfully with "humid chaos" beyond. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's translator focus—prioritizing visual symbols and verbal fragments over other senses. The cast functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables the central action of decryption.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulative deepening as each translated symbol increases emotional weight, from "house is quiet" to "honey-cakes" to the General's recognition. The dominant stake—bridging the human cost beneath political positions—tightens when Elias chooses to translate vulnerability rather than intelligence. Cost is visible in the General's defensive erosion and Anja's separation from her mother.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of translating a child's code into universal human fears, avoiding abstract statements about war or peace. The final image of the General's gentle touch while "something had imperceptibly cleared" offers resonant answer to the conflict's human core without moralizing. The coral fragment and cast symbols work as particulars that accumulate meaning rather than imposed metaphors.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elias's attention to linguistic patterns and "tangled forms," with effective modulation from clinical observation to "lotus-hearted ache." Dialogue carries strong subtext, particularly Anja's medicated fragments that reveal more than intended. Minor weakness in the General's slightly generic military terseness, though his final silence speaks effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"pitted, convoluted fragment" simultaneously describes object and mirrors Elias's knotted memory. Sentence variety creates natural rhythm, particularly the shift to shorter units during the General's entrance. Minor deduction for "stark white plaster" and "glassy and unfocused" approaching stock description, and one instance of filter-verb clustering ("He felt...he saw").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh angle on war mediation through child's cast symbols rather than diplomatic channels, with specific details like "graphite rubbed from a pencil stub" grounding the concept. The translator-as-emotional-bridge avoids expected territory. However, the setup of separated family across conflict lines is somewhat familiar, and the resolution through paternal recognition, while well-executed, doesn't fully transform the archetype.</comment>
