<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is beautifully grounded in grief and a specific promise to find the color of sound, with contradictory impulses (telling himself it's just work vs. knowing it's pilgrimage) acting simultaneously. The final renunciation of light for darkness to fulfill his vow carries visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for slight emotional smoothness in the underwater sequence where stress doesn't fully degrade perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through lanterns→descent→darkness→synesthetic revelation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Silas experiences the indigo of remembered music, fulfilling his vow with the cost of ten years' grief acknowledged. The piece teaches its pattern early (light/dark, sound/color) and pays it off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The underwater library constrains choice beautifully—Silas must turn off his light to achieve his goal, making darkness itself the setting that enables revelation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt spray, liquid night, books like sleeping bats). The wreck's physical specificity shapes the journey and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: surface ritual→descent→navigation→deliberate darkness, with each stage narrowing options toward the singular act of floating in silence. The cost is legible in "exhausted and calm" and "for the first time in ten years, it was not empty." Agency manifests as deliberate renunciation of light to find sound's color.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of finding light through darkness, sound through silence. The ending offers a non-literal answer to the central question—synesthesia as devotion made manifest—that reweights the opening's "phantom preceding the light." Subtext operates throughout, particularly in "This wasn't about grief; it was about physics."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through Silas's technical precision masking emotional purpose ("gauges, seals, weights—irrefutable truth"). Voice modulates effectively from surface formality to underwater immediacy to the final calm. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in "celestial river" that doesn't fully match the established pragmatic voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the brass tag establishes loss, promise, and specific detail). Strong rhythm variation and sentence-level propulsion, particularly in the descent sequence. Minor figurative density in places ("phantom," "temporary star," "celestial river") but serves the accumulative pattern without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief ritual and synesthetic quest offers a fresh angle on loss, with the specific inflection of finding color through deliberate darkness. The underwater library as site of revelation transforms expected memorial tropes. Risk-taking in the quiet, interior climax pays off, though the concept doesn't fully escape familiar grief-and-promise territory.</comment>
