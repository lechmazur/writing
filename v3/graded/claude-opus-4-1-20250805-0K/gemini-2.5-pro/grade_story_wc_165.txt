<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is crystal clear—transforming monotony through calculated creativity—and his methodical patience under no external pressure shows strong character consistency. The internal satisfaction as his only required applause reveals authentic character depth. Minor deduction for the couple's reaction being somewhat convenient, though their shared wonder works thematically.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the mural's illumination reweights the entire arcade space through orchestrated physics. The cost is subtly felt through Kael's ephemeral art that dissolves immediately, leaving only phantom warmth. The chain of causality from channel to coin-pusher to light beam is meticulously traced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tidal arcade setting actively constrains and enables Kael's art through water channels, machine vibrations, and architectural features. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—the "rhythmic hiss" of tide, "tarnished tokens," "checkered floor" all serve the atmosphere. The bishop becomes a crucial prism, the environment itself participating in the final illumination.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation as each precisely calculated element compounds—water channel, coin weight, vibration timing—toward the singular moment of illumination. The dominant stake (creating beauty from monotony) tightens as environmental factors must align perfectly. Cost manifests in the art's immediate dissolution, though agency remains entirely with Kael's orchestration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of finding transcendence in mundane spaces emerges organically through Kael's methodical art-making without any moralizing. The mural of a woman "casting a net into a cosmic sea" provides a resonant non-literal answer about creativity's reach. The couple's transformation from argument to wonder embodies the theme through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with Kael seeing probability threads and treating the arcade as an equation to solve. Prose rhythm modulates effectively from patient observation to the crescendo of cascading tokens and light. Minor deduction for some filter verbs ("appeared to be resting," "seemed to shine") that could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"indifferent glitter of stars" both describes and establishes tone. Syntax varies naturally with momentum building toward the light sequence. Slight deduction for "seemed to happen" and occasional elevated diction ("orchestrated serendipity") that briefly distances the reader.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of engineering serendipity through physics and poetry is genuinely fresh, avoiding typical street performer tropes. The specificity of using tidal patterns and arcade machinery as artistic medium shows strong originality. Risk-taking in the quiet, ephemeral nature of the art heightens meaning (+0.3 within band).</comment>
