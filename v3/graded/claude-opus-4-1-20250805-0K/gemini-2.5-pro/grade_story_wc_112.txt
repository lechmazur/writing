<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong characterization through embodied details (hydraulic-stained hands, practical vs theoretical tension) and a meaningful internal shift from skepticism to vertigo. The final realization lands with genuine emotional weight ("irrevocably, and quietly, re-calibrated forever"), though Aris remains somewhat functional rather than complex.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens building to a Conceptual Repricing where Elias's worldview fundamentally shifts from linear to lateral time. The cost is existential vertigo and the loss of singular identity ("multitudes"), landing with genuine conceptual weight in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The xenobiology station and Xylos plains create atmospheric pressure through specific details (violet glow, crystalline wings, planetary stillness). The "mechanically warm" device and its "icy warmth" constrain the moment's possibility, though the setting could more actively shape choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes build through the narrowing window of planetary stillness and Elias's role as the steady hands Aris needs. The tension peaks at the lever pull with genuine uncertainty, though the resolution's quiet revelation lacks the visceral cost that higher bands demand.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lateral echo revealing simultaneous possibilities—"a different choice, a different focus, a different now." The final image of being held "not one life, but multitudes" resonates without moralizing, reweighting everything prior.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voices: Elias's practical perception versus Aris's theoretical obsession, maintained through selective detail and diction. The POV holds steady with clean focalization, though some passages drift toward explanatory ("The principles are simple, really").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("mapped with fine white scars," "The icy air of the station now felt like a cradle"). Some overwriting appears ("profound, quiet vertigo," "mechanically warm and deeply resonant truth") but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lateral time concept offers a fresh angle on parallel worlds, grounded through the practical mechanic character and the specific planetary conditions. The execution feels competent rather than daring, though the quiet revelation suits the "subdued awakenings" concept.</comment>
