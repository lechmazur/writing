<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—discovering what walls dream about drives her methodical investigation. Her internal conflict between professional detachment and emotional engagement manifests through embodied action (gentle touch on brittle leather, careful placement of the negative back). The final choice to leave the evidence "where it belonged" represents earned renunciation with visible cost, though some interiority relies on abstraction ("weight of confession").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through sensory discovery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara chooses professional distance over personal burden. The closure lands with felt cost—"The wall's dream was not hers to carry"—as she deliberately returns the evidence. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words (corridor echo cartographer, climate shifts, grand estate).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage and fireplace constrain Elara's investigation path and enable discovery. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (moss scent, soot texture, sunbeam through ivy). The environment doesn't quite reach 9+ because while it shapes discovery, it doesn't force a harder choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from acoustic mapping to confronting catastrophic guilt through the diary discoveries. The Prometheus revelation deepens pressure—"not a failed solution; it was an accelerant"—forcing Elara's choice between exposure and preservation. Cost is legible in her deliberate return of evidence, though the tightening could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the accumulation of "burden of knowing" without explicit moralizing. The final image of leaving ghosts to their ivy-veiled passage resonantly answers whether some histories should remain buried. The Prometheus metaphor and "wrong door" imagery deepen without overstatement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's acoustic sensitivity ("sigh of settling dust from the ghost of a footstep"). Voice maintains consistency through scientific precision shifting to emotional weight. No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice modulates effectively with discovery intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean with strong information density—most sentences advance discovery or atmosphere. Some elevated diction in peak moments ("curdle into catastrophe," "contagion for the sky") slightly strains the established register. No significant loops or scaffolding, though occasional abstract phrasing ("legacy's burden") could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The profession of "corridor echo cartographer" offers a fresh angle on post-climate fiction. The acoustic mapping frame transforms familiar guilt-and-discovery material through specific sensory work. The Prometheus formula as "accelerant" rather than failed solution provides genuine conceptual freshness.</comment>
