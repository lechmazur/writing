I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory density and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the sky manifests inside walls.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's face-blindness that paradoxically enables her to read patterns others miss is beautifully embodied through concrete action (fingers reading the coin's fractally precise marks). The contradiction between limitation and strength drives the closure choice effectively. Minor deduction for slightly abstract "pattern of anxieties" early on.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where pressing the obsidian stone transforms the library into a living cosmos - the sky literally mirrored inside walls with clear cost (building about to fall). The accumulative lens holds consistently through sensory layering. Orientation anchored clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The petrified oak library constrains and enables the central action - its heartwood becomes the activation point for transformation. Sensory detail ("air tasted of ancient paper and dry rot") filtered through Elara's specific perceptual bias. The fractally precise coin patterns mirror the final light veins brilliantly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating pressure: silence → machinery cessation → coin reading → lock opening → building groans → final transformation. The "limit of her time closing in" creates genuine urgency. Cost is visible in the imminent destruction framing the achievement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of finding "beauty within boundaries" emerges organically through Elara's limitation becoming strength. The final image of "unending cosmos held within walls about to fall" perfectly encapsulates the paradox without stating it. The fractally precise pattern recurring from coin to light network creates deep resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's face-blindness shapes every observation ("faceless dark," reading through touch). Prose rhythm modulates effectively from contemplative opening to urgent middle to transcendent close. Minor filter verb presence ("she knew") doesn't significantly harm momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("silence was a physical weight"). Information density high throughout. Some minor scaffolding ("She knew where to go") and occasional filter constructions reduce immediacy slightly but don't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist who reads patterns instead of features is genuinely fresh. The fractally precise coin as key mechanism elevates beyond typical lock-picking. The synthesis of limitation-as-strength with the scholar's guild's ultimate ambition feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
