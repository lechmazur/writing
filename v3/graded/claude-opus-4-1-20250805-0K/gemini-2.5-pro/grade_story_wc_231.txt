I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through borrowed memories, building toward a resonant reconfiguration about witnessed isolation and the release of ghosts.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation through "borrowed memories" creates genuine interiority with embodied contradiction—the "hollow space" he feels, the "aching connection to the man he never knew." The final choice to preserve the boutonnière as a "small, lonely monument" shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("tormented, haunted thing") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Silas's act of preserving the boutonnière transforms both men's isolation into "witnessed and shared" connection—clear before/after with emotional cost. The accumulative structure through nightly memory sessions builds coherently. The "borrowed memories" mechanism strains credibility slightly but serves the emotional truth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The opal dock, lighthouse beam as "metronome," and alpine/ocean juxtaposition create atmospheric pressure. "A man made of absences" effectively uses negative space as setting detail. The Edelweiss placement "between a nautilus shell and a glass fishing float" grounds the final image specifically, though the tower interior could be more tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from curiosity to "profound, aching connection" as memories accumulate, with the ocean/mountain parallel providing thematic pressure. The revelation that the stranger came "to let it drown" effectively tightens options. Cost is felt in Silas's "breath hitched" and his recognition of "one less ghost in the world."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the gaps—"the spaces between these moments" telling "the real story." The final image of Silas in the lighthouse beam, having witnessed another's ghost, offers a non-literal answer about isolation becoming connection through understanding. No explicit moralizing; meaning accrues through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "salt-bleached piling," "nautical twilight." The perceptual signature of noticing absences ("no coat against the chill, no bag for a journey") is character-specific. Rhythm modulates effectively from contemplative to revelatory without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with moments of beauty ("mist at nautical twilight had stolen the horizon"). Some abstract phrasing weakens immediacy ("tormented, haunted thing," "profound, aching connection"). Minor redundancy in explaining the gaps concept. Information density is good but could be tighter in the middle exploration sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "borrowed memories" concept offers a fresh angle on connection through objects. The specific synthesis of lighthouse keeper encountering mountain memory at sea feels non-obvious. The resolution—preserving rather than discarding the boutonnière—subverts expected closure while maintaining emotional truth.</comment>
