I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and description toward a resonant final revelation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is clear and rooted in his legacy of disbelief, driving him to seek truth in isolation. His internal conflict between inherited skepticism and desire for validation creates genuine tension. The final choice to break the seal shows agency with visible cost—he knows he'll be disbelieved. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("copperlight repose") that doesn't fully embody the emotional state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure building from inherited disbelief through discovery to accepted martyrdom. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—breaking the seal transforms the suspended moment into mundane death while cementing the narrator's role as truth-teller who won't be believed. Cost is visible in the final paragraph's acceptance of disbelief. Slight deduction for orientation taking until paragraph 2 to fully anchor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison setting excellently constrains choice through isolation and its "strange physics." Vivid sensory work with "copperlight repose" and "salt air failed to erode certain sorrows." The confessional screen and suspended bodies create a powerful spatial tableau. The setting actively shapes the discovery and final choice, though some descriptions lean abstract rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding truth versus being believed—escalates from seeking story through discovering the impossible to accepting disbelief. The suspension discovery deepens pressure by forcing a choice between preserving the miracle or releasing it. Cost is clear in sacrificing credibility. Missing stronger mid-story tightening that would push this higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the parallel between father's fiction and son's truth, both ending in disbelief. The suspended betrayal tableau mirrors the narrator's own frozen moment between truth and credibility. The final image of "the hush is mine now" resonantly answers the central question about ownership of story. Avoids explicit moralizing while maintaining complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled elevated diction fitting the narrator's literary bent. Strong perceptual signature in phrases like "shadows held their breath" and "thread this labyrinth." Consistent POV with no head-hopping. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("copperlight repose") that slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variety and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("rusted iron needle stitching the gray sea to the gray sky") and abstract phrasing. Template cadence appears briefly in "I saw it... It was through... It was not quite" sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on the unreliable narrator legacy through the supernatural preservation of a murder scene. The specific detail of bodies suspended in betrayal gestures is memorably original. The synthesis of inherited disbelief with witnessed impossibility creates a non-obvious resolution. Transforms the "cry wolf" trope through genuine supernatural encounter.</comment>
