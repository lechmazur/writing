<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is rooted in his precognitive curse and promise to Elara, with concrete embodied reactions (magnetic boots groaning, slumping to knees). The internal conflict between preserving patterns and taking desperate action crystallizes in his choice to use the star dust, with visible cost in his physical exhaustion and the irrevocable use of his last resort.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal lens: vision of destruction → decision to use star dust → channeling aurora through rock patterns → diverting the tide. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost (exhaustion, spent resource) and conceptual shift (from observer to active participant). Minor orientation friction with "silver-skinned eels" and their purpose slightly dulls early clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frictionless world and tidal bluff create specific constraints (magnetic boots necessary, patterns vulnerable to erasure). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (aurora as "celestial river," sea's "silent caress"). The setting directly enables the solution through basalt conductivity and aurora energy, though the eel pen remains somewhat ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from protecting patterns to survival itself as the vision materializes. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through his choice to use irreplaceable star dust, with clear cost in exhaustion and resource depletion. Pressure coheres under causal lens as each element (vision, aurora pulse, tide surge) tightens options to force action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between observation and intervention, with the final image reweighting Kael's relationship to his visions from passive suffering to active engagement. The mathematical patterns serve as both literal circuit and metaphor for finding order in chaos. The ending's "dawn...might be his own" resonates without stating a moral, earned through his transformation from observer to participant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the speculative setting ("fractured timelines," "chaotic grace"). Perceptual signature is distinct in how Kael notices mathematical patterns and cosmic energies. Some filter verb clustering ("could feel," "could sometimes find") slightly dulls immediacy in middle passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression ("a title given by ghosts"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor scaffold appears in repeated "had to" constructions and some synonym churn around patterns/sequences/spirals that creates slight redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The frictionless world premise offers fresh physics with logical consequences (magnetic boots, sliding disasters). The synthesis of precognition, mathematics, and collapsed star dust creates non-obvious solution. The transformation from curse-bearer to active shaper of prophecy provides meaningful subversion of the passive seer trope.</comment>
