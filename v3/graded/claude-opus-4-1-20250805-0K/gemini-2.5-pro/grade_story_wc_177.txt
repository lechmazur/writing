<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's fractured temporal perception creates genuine internal contradiction—he exists only in memory and premonition, never the present, which drives his desperate consumption of the wafer seal. The final transformation where he gains present-tense awareness lands with earned cost: he traded his unique temporal sight for mortal immediacy as the bunker floods.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory fragments and dream-visions build pressure toward Kael's transformation. The closure—gaining present awareness by consuming the seal just as the bunker collapses—delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost: he loses his fractured sight to gain true presence while drowning. The "path grows its walker" revelation reweights the entire custodian lineage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The decaying bunker with its groaning concrete and invading roots constrains every choice, creating a ticking clock that forces Kael's decision. Sensory details like "taste of ozone and forgotten starlight" when he consumes the seal charge the transformation. The storm's physical intrusion—water swirling at his ankles—makes the cost immediate and visceral.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The storm's escalation from "low moan" to violent shuddering to water at Kael's ankles creates coherent pressure that narrows options to a single moment. His agency manifests through choosing to consume the seal rather than preserve it, accepting drowning for a moment of true presence. The cost is unmistakable: he gains awareness but loses his protective temporal distance as death approaches.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The central question—why paths choose their walkers—transforms into its answer: paths grow the walkers they need. The wafer seal shifts from barrier to gate to invitation across the dream sequence, earning its final role as the key one must "eat." The ending's rain on Kael's face "for the very first time" resonates without stating the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael's fractured temporal perception shapes every observation—"the present a gray, smeared watercolor"—creating a distinct perceptual signature. Some elevated diction ("chrysalis designed to break") slightly strains the established voice during peak moments. The shift to present-tense awareness in the final paragraph pays off the temporal conceit effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments like "taste of ozone and forgotten starlight" demonstrate precise sensory work. However, abstract passages ("the path did not choose its walker; it grew the walker it needed") and some elevated register drift ("transcend its own limitations") create distance. The "precisely playful" dream sequence needed more concrete imagery to ground its symbolism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of a guardian cursed with fractured time who must consume the very thing he protects offers a fresh angle on duty and sacrifice. The transformation of the seal from lock to food through dream-logic creates an earned surprise. However, the abstract philosophizing about paths and walkers trends toward familiar territory.</comment>
