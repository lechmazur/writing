<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's method of empathetic projection creates genuine internal conflict between his role as observer and his intimate connection to subjects. The transition from physical thread to visceral experience of Elara's grief and creative transformation earns the final understanding about healing as containment rather than erasure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details build from autumn decay through crimson thread to woven map, culminating in Conceptual Repricing where Elara's absence becomes "triumphant journey." The thread serves as portal device enabling temporal projection with clear cost: Kaelen experiences phantom pain and grief to understand her cartography of healing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The shadowed garden with "damp, sweet scent of decay" and "skeletal branches" creates isolation that enables Kaelen's work, while the palace's "dust-and-incense smell" grounds the projection. The loom's "rhythmic shudder" and "whisper-soft scrape" make Elara's world tactile, and the thread's "coarse texture" anchors both timelines.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from understanding a single absence to experiencing the full weight of Elara's grief-mapping project. The projection's intensification from seeing to feeling ("phantom ache in her shoulders") raises cost, though agency remains primarily observational until Kaelen's final act of writing transforms understanding into testament.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The carpet-as-map metaphor transforms from floor covering to canvas to destination, reweighting absence from loss to arrival. "Healing wasn't the erasure of pain but the creation of a place strong enough to contain it" emerges organically from witnessed creation, avoiding abstract moralizing through concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains literary precision with phrases like "smokeless on the horizon" and "lonesome splendor," modulating between present observation and projection states. The shift to simpler diction during intimate projection ("fierce, determined hope that pulsed in her wrists") tracks emotional proximity without losing narrator coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose density high with lines like "rust-colored chrysanthemums and fallen pear leaves plastered to the mossy ground" doing triple work. Some elevated diction ("translocation," "cartography") fits the scholarly protagonist but occasionally distances. Strong rhythm variation between long descriptive passages and sharp revelatory moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of "composing explained absences" for the living rather than dead offers fresh angle on grief work. The weaving-as-mapping metaphor transforms expected craft imagery into psychological geography, and the final reversal—that absence is arrival—subverts conventional loss narratives through earned specificity.</comment>
