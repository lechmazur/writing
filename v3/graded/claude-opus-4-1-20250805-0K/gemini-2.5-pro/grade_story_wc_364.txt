I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory accumulation and pattern (memories bartered for renewal), with a cadence shift and reweighting at closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation crystallizes through concrete embodied details ("hands too gentle for his trade") and his decisive barter of sensory memories shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. The cost is visceral - he feels "hollowed out, the flavors of his past now just empty words." Minor deduction for slightly abstract phrasing around "quietly determined spirit" but the final choice lands with genuine sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through the bartered memories creating planetary renewal - the blue energy tracing the arch represents earned change with clear cost (Elian's sensory past). The accumulative lens holds as memories transform into planetary healing. Slight deduction for the magician's backstory feeling slightly disconnected from the present arc's causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The failing orchards with floating stone arches create vivid, specific atmosphere that directly pressures choice - the "fine dust that soured the fruit" drives Elian's action. The mine shaft descent and geode chamber constrain his ritual spatially. Deduction for some generic phrasing ("forgotten gods") but the elder-fruit tree marker and geothermal pulse provide strong specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative deepening - from understanding the silk's purpose to descending the shaft to the actual barter of memories, each step narrows options. The cost is unmistakable: trading lived experience for planetary healing. Minor deduction as the magician's initial harm could be more directly connected to Elian's solution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concrete act of bartering personal memories for collective renewal - no abstract moralizing. The final image of "quiet, defiant blue against the endless sky" resonates without stating meaning. The concept of "bartered awakenings" integrates fully with plot mechanics, earning wisdom through specific sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with selective perception ("hands too gentle," "hope, a far more stubborn material") and consistent psychic distance. The prose modulates effectively during the barter sequence. Deduction for occasional elevated diction that slightly exceeds Elian's established register ("rapacious age," "sacred") and some filter constructions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("silk that felt like captured twilight"). However, several instances of elevated diction clash with POV ("rapacious age," "sacred," "nexus"), and there's template cadence in "He placed...He didn't have...He bartered...He offered...He pushed." The paraphrase loop around giving memories (taste/feeling/sensations) costs additional points.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bartered memories concept offers fresh specificity - trading sensory experience for planetary healing avoids generic sacrifice tropes. The floating stone arches as "petrified bones of forgotten gods" provides memorable worldbuilding. Slight deduction for the magician setup feeling somewhat conventional, but the execution transforms familiar elements through concrete detail.</comment>
