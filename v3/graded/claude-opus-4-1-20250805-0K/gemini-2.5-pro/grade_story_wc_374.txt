<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism drives genuine investigation with embodied sensory perception (taste changes) and conflicted impulses between scientific certainty and witnessed phenomena. The carriers' distinct weather signatures create vivid characterization through physical manifestation. Minor deduction for slightly abstract resolution of internal conflict, though the final recognition of "learning to read a map written in lightning and rain" shows earned humility with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with sensory density building toward convergence and resolution. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as carriers find peace and Elara's skepticism transforms to "profoundly illuminated" understanding with visible cost (her certainty replaced by humbling scale). Strong causality through taste-detection method leading to convergence, though the mechanism of why they converge here specifically could be clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lavender bluff setting constrains action to single location while aurora and weather systems create atmospheric pressure. Sensory hierarchy through taste-based detection system is distinctive and shapes investigation method. Environment participates in resolution as aurora responds to convergence, though the forest election context remains somewhat ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual investigation to witnessing collective phenomenon, with pressure building through sensory cacophony and weather system merger. The convergence creates genuine tension about what will happen when storms combine. Cost is visible in Elara's transformed understanding, though the personal risk to her beyond intellectual humbling could be stronger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of empirical limits versus organic phenomena emerges through concrete action without explicit moralizing. The "emergent compass" concept effectively bridges scientific and mystical understanding. Final insight about "learning to read a map written in lightning and rain" resonantly reweights the investigation without stating a moral, though slightly edges toward articulated wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with scientific precision ("luminous skeptic," "terrestrial resonance") and poetic sensibility. Perceptual signature strong through taste-based detection creating unique focalization. Some elevated diction ("terrestrially cosmic," "futuristic nostalgia") occasionally strains POV consistency but serves atmospheric purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong sensory specificity. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor issues: "terrestrially cosmic" appears twice with unclear meaning, some abstract phrasing ("emergent compass" as "biological system") could be more concrete, and occasional elevated register ("celestial curtain call") slightly overwritten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather-carriers as navigation system breakdown creates non-obvious angle on elemental powers trope. Taste-based detection method is genuinely inventive. The convergence resolution avoids expected storm-battle for quieter recognition scene, showing meaningful risk-taking that enhances thematic resonance.</comment>
