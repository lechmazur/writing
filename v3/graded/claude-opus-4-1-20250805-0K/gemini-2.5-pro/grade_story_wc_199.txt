I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through pattern accumulation (leaf sorting, monument building) toward a resonant transformation triggered by the moonstone speck.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is crystal clear and drives every action through concrete, embodied gestures—his chlorophyll-stained hands sorting seeds, building monuments from fallen leaves. The transformation from sorter to awakener feels earned through accumulated particulars, though the emotional complexity could deepen slightly in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds through sorting→monument-building→special leaf→prod→transformation with clear cost (the arbor's long sorrow finally released). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with Elian "emerged transformed" and the arbor breathing again, though the conceptual cost could be slightly more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor functions as both setting and character, its "long, slow sigh" constraining Elian's world while providing the leaves that drive his purpose. Sensory details like "brittle as spun sugar" and "coolness a stark contrast" are selective and purposeful, directly charging the closure transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative density: routine sorting→anomalous leaf discovery→monument construction→the prod decision, with stakes crystallizing around the prophecy's fulfillment. The cost manifests in the arbor's transformation from ash to jade, though the personal stakes for Elian could sharpen further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of tending "small things" leading to monumental change, avoiding any explicit moralizing. The final image of Elian's shimmering hands perfectly reweights the opening's "chlorophyll-stained" description, embodying transformation without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("where past meets prophecy," "mossy delight") that modulates appropriately with emotional intensity. The perceptual signature stays consistent—everything filtered through a patient tender of small things—though occasional phrases like "profound and mossy delight" edge toward repetitive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied rhythm, but some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("tremor of awakening," "shiver of awakening") and the repeated "mossy delight" phrase. The closing paragraph's "very, very small" construction feels slightly precious rather than earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of decoding messages in falling leaves offers a fresh angle on prophecy narratives, with specific details like the miniature monument library feeling original. However, the transformation-through-magical-catalyst resolution follows somewhat familiar fantasy patterns, though executed with distinctive texture.</comment>
