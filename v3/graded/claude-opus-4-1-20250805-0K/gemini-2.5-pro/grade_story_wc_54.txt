<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation evolves credibly from vague philosophical searching to focused problem-solving, with concrete embodied details like "steel-toed boots scuffing" and "quiet hum of curiosity." The final realization about hope as "a current to be rerouted" lands with earned wisdom, though the transformation could use more internal contradiction during the discovery phase.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure as the celestial revelation reweights the terminal's purpose from "leaving" to "a monument to a destination." The cost is conceptual—the building's condemned fate contrasts with its revealed grandeur—and Elara's solitary witness position carries emotional weight. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint and enabler: the abandoned terminal's hidden infrastructure becomes the mechanism for discovery, while carnival detritus provides crucial generators and cables. The final stellar projection transforms the space itself, making environment inseparable from the story's resolution. Sensory detail like "old ozone and new popcorn" efficiently establishes atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through discovery (sextant piece) → investigation (hidden grid) → active problem-solving (rewiring) → revelation (star chart), with each phase narrowing Elara's focus. The cost manifests as her three-hour solitary labor and the poignant contrast between the terminal's magnificent purpose and its demolition fate, though the stakes could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between decay and hidden purpose, with the final insight that hope isn't "an equation to be solved, but a current to be rerouted" arising from concrete action. The image of "resurrected dreams" casting "carnival's trash...in hallowed glow" creates powerful thematic resonance without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct engineering POV filters perception through technical specificity ("daisy-chaining generators," "heavy-gauge industrial cabling") while maintaining lyrical capability ("ghosted overnight, leaving behind the ghost of a ghost"). Voice modulates effectively from practical assessment to wonder, though some phrases like "stoic wonder" feel slightly prescribed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose maintains strong momentum with varied syntax and purposeful technical detail that advances plot. Information density is high—most sentences do multiple jobs. Minor weakness in occasional elevated diction ("hallowed glow," "cartographer's dream") that slightly strains against the engineering POV, but overall clarity and propulsion remain strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The revelation of a spaceport's hidden purpose as an astronomical monument offers genuine surprise that feels earned through the technical discovery process. The synthesis of carnival generators powering forgotten dreams creates memorable imagery. The specific vantage point "sixty-thousand light-years away" adds non-generic detail that elevates the concept.</comment>
