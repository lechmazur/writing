<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to become visible to those who need you" drives concrete choices with embodied urgency—his "quiet click of satisfaction" and the physical archaeology through dusty crawl spaces. The contradiction between wanting visibility while remaining unseen creates genuine tension that earns the final renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward Anya's moment of "profound and bewildered gratitude"—a Resonant Reconfiguration where hope replaces despair with visible cost (her academic ruin transformed). The tape fragment accumulates meaning from obsolete trash to family lifeline, with Elias's invisibility as the price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The library's "sapphire hush" and "stuttering pulses of life" through fixtures create atmospheric pressure that shapes Elias's timing constraints. The tape fragment's physical specificity—"nestled in desiccated silverfish and grit"—and the ventilation architecture enable and constrain his choices throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Elias's routine archaeology to the desperate urgency of preserving Anya's family history, with the outage creating time pressure. His gamble placing the fragment "directly on her closed laptop" demonstrates agency with clear cost—he risks exposure to save her work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of invisible labor creating visible impact emerges through concrete action rather than statement. The final image of Elias slipping "back into the comforting dark" after witnessing Anya's gratitude resonantly answers the question of meaningful connection without recognition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elias's "peculiar sensitivity" to magnetic ghosts and his navigation of "labyrinthine passages with innate knowledge." The prose rhythm modulates from meditative opening to urgent placement of the fragment, with consistent focalization through his embodied experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"the dust itself had long since accepted" establishes both duration and belonging. Some mild figurative density ("sapphire hush," "phantom hand") but serves atmospheric purpose without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of someone with magnetic sense-memory living in library infrastructure offers fresh specificity. While the invisible helper trope is familiar, the particular synthesis of obsolete media preservation and academic desperation creates an earned, non-obvious resolution.</comment>
