I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through the transformation ritual, with the mosaic floor serving as the accumulating pattern that reweights meaning.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent—collecting burdens to give them "a final, quiet home"—with internal contradiction between his cosmic awareness and physical imprisonment driving genuine tension. The transformation of the farmer's grief into stone shows embodied emotion and micro-choice under pressure. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "whalebone reverie" and "shingled hush" that occasionally prioritizes atmosphere over character specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the stone joins the mosaic pattern, making the "shingled hush" deeper and more complete—visible cost through the farmer's transformed pain and Kaelen's eternal imprisonment. The accumulative lens holds as each burden-stone adds to the pattern. Orientation anchors (Kaelen, bronze grotto, post-snowmelt) establish clearly by ~100 words. The "lonely warden" final image crystallizes his role with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bronze grotto with starlight drilling through rock creates a vivid prison-workshop that constrains Kaelen's choices—he can reach across the world psychically but cannot step beyond the walls. The kerosene lamp burner functions as essential tool for the transformation ritual. Sensory detail effectively narrows during the focusing work. The mosaic floor serves as accumulating micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming burdens into peaceful silence—escalates through the ritual's precise steps: drawing the wisp, aligning with starlight, crystallizing the grief. The farmer's "feather-light touch of gratitude" shows immediate consequence. Cost is visible in both the transformed pain and Kaelen's ongoing imprisonment. The accumulative pressure deepens as each stone makes the silence "infinitesimally heavier."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of healing others while remaining trapped, with the "shingled hush" metaphor carrying weight as both absence and "layered presences." The transformation of chaotic grief into ordered stone offers resonant commentary on processing pain. The final image of Kaelen kneeling among the mosaic stones provides a non-literal answer about service and sacrifice without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevation—"bronze grotto," "fractal weaver," "whalebone reverie"—that maintains consistency throughout. The perceptual signature shows Kaelen experiencing burdens as physical sensations ("shard of glass in the psychic current"). Psychic distance modulates effectively from cosmic awareness to intimate focus during the ritual. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "starlight was his ink" and "the frantic pulse of the grief began to slow." Information density high in ritual sequence. Some elevated diction occasionally tips toward purple ("whalebone reverie of Kaelen's existence") but serves atmospheric purpose. Minor redundancy in describing the transformation process. Clear propulsion through the ritual beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of burden-collector archetype with specific transformation mechanism using starlight and brass burner to crystallize grief into stone. The "shingled hush" as layered silences rather than absence shows originality. Risk-taking in the meditative pace and lyric mode pays off through accumulated resonance. The mosaic floor as repository of transformed sorrows offers memorable final image.</comment>
