Looking at this story through a demanding editorial lens, I'll evaluate each category precisely.

**Drive Lens Inferred: Causal** - The story follows a clear because/therefore chain: Elian receives prophecies → broadcasts interpretations → followers respond → storm forces choice → map discovery enables third path → broadcast rejection transforms world.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and consistent, driving escalating choices under pressure. The final broadcast represents earned agency with visible cost (rejecting spectral masters for human autonomy). Internal conflict between serving shadows versus shepherding humanity creates genuine tension. Slight deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("cold and sharp panic") rather than fully embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong causal chain culminates in decisive change: Elian rejects both shadow-paths and creates a third way, with immediate world transformation (storm dies, sun breaks through). The map discovery enables this resolution through clear because/therefore logic. Cost is visible in rejecting supernatural power for uncertain human agency. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of the chest opening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively constrains and enables choices - the cobalt portico filters the map's meaning, the storm's violence forces the crisis moment. Vivid sensory detail ("pitted iron," "bruised-indigo lens") creates atmosphere while serving plot. The setting transforms causally with events (storm pauses, clouds part). Slight deduction for some abstract descriptors ("older, deeper places").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate clearly from isolated prophet to fulcrum of nascent world. The Great Storm forces choice between "absolute order" and "total anarchy," with Elian's agency creating the third path. Pressure coheres through mounting follower expectations and warring shadow demands. Cost is legible in abandoning supernatural allegiance. Minor deduction for somewhat abstract articulation of the shadow-choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of human agency versus spectral control emerges through concrete action, not statement. The final broadcast embodies the thematic answer: humanity must build its own dawn. The cobalt/gold color shift reinforces transformation without heavy-handedness. Some deduction for explicit thematic language in the final broadcast ("dawn built by human hands") that edges toward statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled lyricism ("churning cloud-sea," "cobalt glass portico"). POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature clear in how Elian processes the world through radio frequencies and atmospheric phenomena. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the established voice ("lyrically prophetic sorrow").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative excess in places ("bruised-indigo lens," "slick and serpentine") without full pattern-teaching. Minor template cadence in middle section ("One frequency would... Another would..."). No major clarity issues or loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prophet/radio operator creates memorable premise. The concept of choosing between competing supernatural voices, then rejecting both for human agency, offers genuine originality. Specific details like "vacuum tubes and brass dials" ground the fantastical. The resolution through map-filtered-by-glass shows inventive problem-solving that feels earned.</comment>
