I'll evaluate this story under a **Causal Drive Lens** - the narrative follows clear because/therefore linkages as the protagonist's confession leads to seeking abandoned places, which leads to hearing factory sounds, which compels investigation and ultimately resolution.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("three-word sickness I'd swallowed") and clear motivation driving reckless exploration. The protagonist's contradictory impulses - skepticism versus engagement with the paranormal - create authentic tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the confession itself, which remains unspecified.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change closure as protagonist transforms from passive guilt to active intervention, earning self-knowledge through helping ghosts. Causal chain holds: confession → seeking weight in abandoned places → hearing sounds → investigating → solving spectral crisis. Cost is visible in "bone-deep, earned exhaustion" and the acknowledged burden that remains but can now be carried.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail ("damp, devouring dark," "oily water," "beaded valve wheel") with setting actively constraining choice - the tunnel leads to the mill, the valve wheel becomes the solution. Environment shapes the entire resolution as the industrial setting mirrors the protagonist's need to "work through" guilt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal confession to confronting spectral accusation ("They thought I was part of the catastrophe"). The valve wheel moment creates genuine pressure where protagonist must act despite fear. Cost lands in both physical exhaustion and emotional transformation - knowing they can carry their burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between protagonist's "I did nothing" and the ghost shift's endless repetition of failure. The final image of earned exhaustion after helping others resonates without stating a moral. The industrial ghost shift becomes a perfect metaphor for repetitive guilt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled diction ("ringing hush," "porous and strange") that maintains consistency through pressure. Perceptual signature clear in how the protagonist uses radio calls as "bizarre interpretive lens." No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice remains coherent and specific throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the silence a physical pressure against my eardrums"). Some filter verb clusters ("I hoped," "I kept," "I thought") and minor redundancy in describing the factory sounds. Information density high in key beats, particularly the valve wheel sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of urban exploration with supernatural radio show creates non-obvious angle. The specific detail of using call-in psychic shows as interpretive framework is original. Risk-taking in leaving the confession abstract while making the ghost encounter concrete pays off.</comment>
