<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's emotional contradiction between detachment and raw memory creates genuine internal conflict, particularly in the physical struggle with the cloth that embodies his psychological resistance. The transition from "confidently uncertain" to accepting evidence of what "always remained" shows earned character movement with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's shift from seeing the quarry as "a wound" to "just a place...longing for a new sound," with the grille cloth's placement representing acceptance rather than disposal. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory memories cascade to reweight the artifact's meaning, though the cost could be more viscerally rendered in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer and limestone pit create effective containment for introspection, while tactile details of the grille cloth's "coarse, familiar texture" and specific Marshall amp provenance ground the emotional archaeology. The vast empty quarry transforms from wound to "echo valley," constraining and enabling Elias's final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from inventory task to existential question of "anything of value left," with the physical struggle against the snagged cloth operating as external manifestation of internal resistance. The tightening occurs when pulling the cloth free causes his "facts as shield" to crumble, forcing confrontation with suppressed memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of finding signal in noise emerges organically through the artifact's transformation from "objectively worthless" to "evidence," avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the cloth placed beside the appraiser's loupe resonates as neither asset nor liability but proof "that even after the applause, something always remained."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent interiority with precise technical vocabulary ("salt-and-pepper basketweave," "gooseneck lamp") that reflects Elias's appraiser expertise while emotional passages shift to more fragmented, sensory language. The perceptual signature of cataloguing and assessing permeates even emotional moments ("objectively worthless"), though some phrases like "geography of his own heart" edge toward writerly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong sensory density and information layering, particularly in passages like "ozone crackle of an overloaded power strip and Jez's cheap clove cigarettes." However, abstract phrases like "geography of his own heart" and "strange, dusty purgatory" create occasional register drift, and some metaphors ("fortress of facts") lean toward the expected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The parallel between roadie and appraiser professions ("one required an ear for feedback, the other an eye for fakes") offers fresh synthesis, while the specific Marshall amp detail and quarry-as-echo-valley transformation avoid generic treatment. The core insight about evidence versus assets provides non-obvious resolution, though the emotional archaeology frame is somewhat familiar.</comment>
