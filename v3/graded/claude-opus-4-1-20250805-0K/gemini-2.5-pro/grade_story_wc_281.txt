<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion through somatic markers ("cold dread bloomed in his sternum," "warmth spreading from his solar plexus") and contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. desire to connect). The final choice to believe through physical sensation is earned through prior causality. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("fierce belief," "affectionate skeptic") rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through two light-painting experiments that reweight the central question of connection. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when they "devise their own perfect, irrefutable language" with visible emotional cost ("willowglass hope"). The static shock memory and grandfather's funeral create causal linkage that narrows Elias's skepticism into acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The light painting studio functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (darkness required for technique, specific tools like LED wands). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("cavernous dark," "small red light a lone star"). The muscovite geode and light tools charge the final image, though some opportunities for tactile detail in the painting sequences are missed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from testing a theory to validating their entire relationship's foundation. The two experiments tighten pressure—first matching grief, then proving the static shock connection. Cost is legible when Elias's "skepticism wavered, a hairline crack" leading to full acceptance. Minor deduction for relatively gentle pressure that could push harder toward irrevocable change.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of light painting as communication beyond words. The final image of "two sides of a secret coin" and their "perfect, irrefutable language" offers a non-literal answer about connection transcending scientific proof. Subtext operates beautifully through the somatic translations and what remains unspoken between them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with scientific precision meeting emotional yearning ("hairline crack in a solid wall"). Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("Ready for what, another disappointment?" bitten back). Some filter verbs ("he felt," "he remembered") and occasional register elevation ("willowglass hope") slightly muddy the voice consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high in action sequences. Deductions for metaphor density in places ("spun glass," "willowglass hope") and some redundancy ("fierce belief"/"loved her fierce belief"). The paraphrase of feeling descriptions ("cold dread"/"sharp and sudden") creates minor loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathy aftermath with light painting as translation method—specific and non-obvious. The somatic marker system offers genuine originality. Some safety in emotional resolution (both get validation) prevents higher scoring, though the specificity of execution partially compensates.</comment>
