<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amal's motivation is viscerally clear—the wedding massacre drives her obsessive hunt for where "unused potential pools." Her grief manifests through concrete actions (gripping console, clutching geode) and the contradictory impulses of scientific pursuit versus raw loss create genuine tension. The character earns her final stance through consistent causality, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("scoured her clean of illusion").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—Amal discovers the "reservoir" where stolen futures exist, crystallizing her hunt's target with palpable cost ("cold, dense star in her chest"). The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently and builds pressure through the cooling window constraint. The cost is emotionally felt through the geode's transformation from wedding gift to focusing lens for grief.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choice through the cooling circuit breakers creating urgency, and technical details (capacitor tick, coolant flow) ground the hunt. The geode crystal functions as micro-setting, constraining emotional focus and charging the final image. Some technical exposition ("perturbation theory") could integrate more smoothly into action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the tightening time window as systems cool and reset, forcing Amal's desperate calculation sprint. The discovery of the resonance signature meaningfully deepens her options from hunting an abstraction to having "a target." Cost is legible in the transformation from grief to trajectory, though the physical stakes could press harder.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the physics metaphor—potential as redirectable current, the cosmic theft of unlived futures. The geode's evolution from wedding gift to grief-focusing lens to reflection of "terrible, beautiful coordinates" creates resonant accumulation. The ending offers a non-literal answer about where stolen lives persist without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends technical precision with poetic grief ("deathwatch beetle," "white-hot shriek"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("intangibly tangible echo"). The perceptual signature—seeing physics in emotional terms—is consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("serene blue lie," "cold, dense star") but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most high-pressure sentences without clear payoff. Some paraphrase loops ("unused potential pools" appears multiple times) and occasional register drift ("titular perturbation") reduce momentum. Information density is generally high with purposeful rhythm variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of hunting where "unused potential pools" through physics equations offers genuine freshness, transforming a grief narrative through specific scientific framework. The synthesis of emotional loss with quantum mechanics feels earned, though some elements (perturbation theory) could push further from familiar templates.</comment>
