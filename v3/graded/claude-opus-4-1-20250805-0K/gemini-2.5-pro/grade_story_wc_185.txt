<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is crystalline and his internal state richly embodied through "hammered repose" and the physical weight of sound. The character makes meaningful micro-choices (selecting specific ice, internalizing its pattern) that reveal values under pressure. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "fortress of will" during the crucial conjuring moment, though the cost lands clearly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through ice-reading that pays off in the bloom of hush. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("body finally settling into a true and earned repose"). The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently and maintains causality throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The harmonic caves function as both setting and constraint, with the echo chamber stone and ice patterns serving as micro-settings that enable the crucial choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("needle-point of sound," "clear as forgotten air"). The environment directly shapes tactics and charges the final image of restored harmony.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding quiet) is signaled immediately and pressure tightens through Kaelen's journey deeper into the caves. The moment of conjuring creates genuine risk ("terrifying second, the hum intensified") before resolution. Cost is legible in the physical toll and the earned repose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between discord and harmony, with the ice patterns serving as a concrete metaphor for finding structure in chaos. The final image offers resonant closure without stating a moral. Slight deduction for "he had not banished the storm, but he had found its eye" edging toward articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Kaelen's mapkeeper expertise shapes what he notices ("jagged paths," "crystalline flaw was a note"). Voice maintains consistency through pressure, with syntax appropriately tightening during the conjuring sequence. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean with strong information density and purposeful rhythm variation. Figurative language enhances without overwhelming ("symphony of nullity," "whirlpool"). Minor repetition of "hum" is contextually justified. No loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The ice-reading method for achieving silence offers a fresh angle on magical systems. The synthesis of geological expertise with mystical practice feels organic. The specific solution grows from established character knowledge rather than convenience.</comment>
