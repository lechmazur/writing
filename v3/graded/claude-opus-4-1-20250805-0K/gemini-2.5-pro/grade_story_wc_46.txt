I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through patient polishing motions, memory layering, and sensory accumulation toward a transformative moment where the glass begins to glow.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through specific actions (polishing with "careful, repetitive motions"). The fire memory provides concrete backstory that justifies her goal "to share light without using fire." Internal conflict between earthbound reality and celestial yearning creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for slightly abstract emotional processing ("quiet, determined goal" could be more embodied).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the polished glass transforms into self-sustaining light, fundamentally changing Elara's relationship to her purpose. The accumulative lens holds consistently through rhythmic polishing, memory layering, and sensory buildup. Cost is visible in "hours bled into a single, focused moment" and the patient labor required. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established clearly in opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The grotto setting actively constrains and enables: mist blocks stars (creating the problem), serpentine walls later "shimmer with soft, aquatic light" revealing "intricate maps." Sea glass as micro-setting object transforms from "murky teal" refuse to luminescent artifact. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("cool and tasting of salt"). Setting directly shapes the final transformation when twilight "pierced the grotto's entrance."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (creating light without fire) established early and deepens through patient accumulation. The glass's transformation from opaque to "reflectively vibrant" to self-luminescent represents meaningful escalation under the accumulative lens. Cost manifests in time ("hours bled"), physical effort (repetitive polishing), and emotional weight of fire memory. Minor deduction: the final transformation relies partially on coincidental twilight rather than pure protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between "hungry, fleeting" fire and "patient and eternal" starlight. The polishing process embodies the theme of transformation through patience. Final image of "quiet light for a world that had grown too loud and too bright" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Grandmother's wisdom earned through specific memory context rather than platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices celestial metaphors ("earthbound star watcher"), tactile details ("fingers stained with saltwater and grit"), and light qualities. Voice modulates effectively from meditative rhythm during polishing to wonder at transformation. Psychic distance controlled well, moving closer during intense focus. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("zephyr bloom") that slightly exceeds POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful repetition ("patient," "polishing"). Information density high in descriptive passages. Some overwriting in metaphorical language ("pearl of stillness," "zephyr bloom promising a soft unfolding") that occasionally obscures clarity. Template cadence appears briefly ("She began...She paused...She returned"). Strong opening and closing lines that frame the transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of star-watching and sea glass polishing creates non-obvious connection. The village fire backstory adds specific stakes beyond generic light-creation. Transformation of discarded sea glass into luminescent artifact offers fresh angle on reclamation theme. Some derivative elements in the wise grandmother trope and mystical transformation, but execution remains specific and grounded.</comment>
