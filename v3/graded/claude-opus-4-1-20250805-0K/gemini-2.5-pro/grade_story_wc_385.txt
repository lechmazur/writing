<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and rooted in personal loss (her mother's silence), driving her quest through embodied perception ("felt less in her ears and more in the marrow of her bones"). The transformation from question-asker to "finisher of songs" shows earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("reed-blown melancholy") and limited internal contradiction in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where Lyra accepts her role as "finisher of songs" - a clear before/after with emotional cost ("single tear"). The piece teaches its pattern early through progressive echoes and whispers, building to the revelation about cosmic debt. Orientation anchors clearly (canyon echo singer, serpentine nexus). Minor deduction for slightly abstract conceptual resolution that could use more embodied cost in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nexus functions as active setting, constraining Lyra's journey through "winding stone corridors" and culminating in the resonant crystal formation that mirrors her seashell. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("scent of dust and starlight," "liquid silver" pooling). The environment directly shapes the resolution when she must harmonize with the crystal's frequency. Lacks some tactile specificity in middle passages.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through progressive disclosure from initial question ("why some echo") through personal grief (mother's silence) to cosmic understanding. The dominant stake - understanding echoes as "resonances of cosmic debt" - tightens when Lyra must actively complete songs rather than just listen. Cost is visible in accepting this burden. One meaningful deepening occurs when understanding shifts from intellectual to embodied action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between completion and incompletion, with Lyra's mother's "perfect silence" providing the key insight. The final image of becoming a "finisher of songs" offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates through the seashell's whispers and the notion of "cosmic debt." Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "resonances of cosmic debt" phrasing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with Lyra experiencing sound physically ("vibration she felt less in her ears and more in the marrow of her bones"). Voice maintains consistency through lyrical register appropriate to the mystical setting. Some elevated diction ("serpentine nexus," "progressive disclosure") occasionally drifts from embodied perception. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good with lines doing multiple jobs. Some abstract phrasing reduces immediacy ("webs of intrigue," "resonances of cosmic debt," "reed-blown melancholy"). Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "She [verb]" constructions. Opening and closing lines effectively frame the journey.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo mythology with personal grief creates an original premise about unfinished cosmic songs. The specific angle of becoming a "finisher of songs" rather than just a listener transforms the familiar quest narrative. The whispering seashell and resonant crystal formation add unique specificity. Execution is competent though some metaphysical concepts lean toward abstraction.</comment>
