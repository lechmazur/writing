<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Locksmith's motivation is clear and consistent (freeing trapped ideas), driving his methodical approach to the mother's grief. The mother's emotional arc from grief to "peaceful awe" is earned through witnessing the release, though her characterization remains somewhat thin. The piece excels at embodied perception during the ritual ("air grew thin, expectant") but lacks internal contradiction or struggle that would elevate to higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the symphony's release transforms grief into peaceful awe with visible cost (the son's physical remnant dissolving). The piece teaches its magical system early and pays it off through starlight-as-key methodology. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph. The cost is legible in "dissolving into motes of light" and the mother's transformation, though could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stone circle nexus and starlight create atmospheric pressure that directly enables the Locksmith's method—environment constrains when he can work ("only begin in the hush of cosmic possibility"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (silver rays through hair strands, "ozone tang"). The lock of hair functions as micro-setting that charges the final dissolution. World rules remain consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (freeing the trapped music) is signaled early and escalates through the ritual's progression from waiting to humming to dissolution. The "guardian of the secret" (fear) provides coherent opposition that must be confused rather than confronted directly. Cost is visible in the physical dissolution of the son's remnant, though the conflict lacks a decisive tightening moment that would elevate the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of ideas as living things imprisoned by fear, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the symphony "drifting on solar winds, seeking a new mind" offers resonant non-literal answer to the thematic question. Subtext operates through the ritual's indirect approach ("convincing it that it had never been a lock at all"). The piece resists tidy resolution, leaving the music's future open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and distinct perceptual signature ("ley lines of memory and starlight"). Prose modulates effectively during the ritual sequence, though some elevated diction ("improbable longing emanating") occasionally strains against the otherwise grounded voice. No dialogue to evaluate. The narrative stance maintains appropriate mystery without withholding crucial information.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythmic variation, though some overwriting appears ("profound silence fell over the nexus," "immense power he was wielding"). Information density is high in ritual sequences. Minor template cadence in "He was not... he was convincing" construction. The piece avoids major loops or scaffolding, maintaining momentum through selective detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of using starlight to unlock emotional/creative barriers offers fresh angle on grief narrative. The Locksmith's methodology (confusing rather than breaking locks) transforms expected confrontation. Specific details like the "salt-white stones" and starlight filtering through hair create memorable texture. The piece commits fully to its magical realist premise without retreat.</comment>
