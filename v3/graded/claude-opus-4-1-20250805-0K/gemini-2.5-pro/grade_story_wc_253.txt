I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's performed narration as grief-management creates genuine internal contradiction, with the whittling revealing deeper impulses than his theatrical surface. The moral ambiguity around watching Mara's arrest lands with real weight. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract formulation "cultivate lightness in grief" which edges toward therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through performed narration, whittling, and the final placement of the bird in Mara's bouquet—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear emotional cost. The piece teaches its pattern early (theatrical narration as shield) and pays it off when the performance ends. Slight deduction for the marginally abstract phrasing of "remade hush" which could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The turbines' "low, percussive thrum" and "whump-whump-whump" effectively pressure the scene, while the tactile whittling grounds us in specificity. The dried bouquet functions as charged setting. Deduction for not fully exploiting how the turbines might more directly constrain Elias's choices beyond atmospheric presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative deepening: theatrical narration → private whittling → placement in bouquet → dropping the performance. The guilt about Mara crystallizes the moral cost. Minor deduction because the physical stakes could be more immediate—we know the consequences exist but don't feel their proximity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theatrical performance as survival mechanism brilliantly embodies the theme without stating it. The wooden bird finding "its silent grove" resonates as both literal action and thematic culmination. The ending achieves genuine complexity about complicity and survival without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct voice through the theatrical register ("our hero procures the vessel") contrasting with flat affect ("his voice flat, stripped of all theatricality"). Strong perceptual signature in how Elias notices dust motes and wood curls. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("percussive thrum") that slightly exceeds the POV's established range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "whump-whump-whump." Some figurative density in places ("island in a sea of noise," "pocket of air in the crushing pressure") without full payoff. The abstract formulations ("cultivate lightness in grief," "remade hush") create minor opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The happiness mandate as dystopian frame offers fresh stakes, and the theatrical narration of tea-making as grief management is genuinely inventive. The moral ambiguity of survival through compliance while others face consequences adds sophisticated complexity. Slight deduction for the concept of "remade hush" remaining somewhat abstract.</comment>
