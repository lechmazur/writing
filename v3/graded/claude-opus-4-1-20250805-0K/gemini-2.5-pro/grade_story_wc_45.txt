<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal contradiction between rational skepticism and desperate yearning for faith drives genuine complexity, particularly in his recognition that "forgiving himself for dismissing the woman he loved would be the work of a lifetime." The bone-setting metaphor effectively embodies his worldview shift from fixing physical breaks to accepting spiritual fractures. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("cartography of his own failures") that briefly distances from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias charts "his own beautiful, terrifying mistake" with the tooth as its center, crystallizing his acceptance of a larger reality with clear emotional cost. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the discovery serving as pattern break that reweights his entire worldview. The cost—a lifetime of dismissing his wife's beliefs—is palpable in "Forgiving himself for dismissing the woman he loved would be the work of a lifetime."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hedge maze and secret garden effectively constrain Elias's solitary reckoning, with tactile details like "hands brushing the leaves" and the "dull clink" of trowel on wood grounding the discovery. The rowan box's carvings directly link to Elara's journals, making the setting instrumental to revelation. Deduction for some generic descriptors ("high green walls") and because the physical environment could pressure choices more actively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's need to reconcile his rationalism with evidence of the supernatural—escalates through the physical discovery that forces "a compound fracture of the soul." The tooth's impossibility creates irreversible pressure that forecloses his skeptical worldview. Cost is visible in accepting he dismissed his wife's truth, though the conflict could benefit from more active resistance before acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The bone-setting metaphor brilliantly unifies theme throughout, evolving from physical craft to spiritual reckoning: "accepting the break's reality" becomes accepting reality's break. The final image of charting constellations from mistakes offers resonant complexity without stating a moral. The changeling tooth as physical proof that shatters certainty embodies the theme perfectly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice modulates from clinical observation ("mass hysteria and the strange shapes grief can take") to raw vulnerability ("desperate, hollow ache"). The bone-setter's perceptual signature shapes everything from "feeling jagged edges" to seeing breaks everywhere. Some elevated diction ("cartography of failures") occasionally strains against the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "crudely fashioned into the shape of an infant" and effective rhythm variation. Information density is high in discovery sequence. Deductions for abstract phrases that could be more concrete ("beautiful fiction," "nostalgic innovation"), some filter constructions ("he now feared"), and occasional overwrought metaphors that don't fully land.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The bone-setter discovering supernatural evidence through his professional tool creates fresh irony, while the changeling tooth as proof transforms a folklore trope through specificity. The constellation-making from mistakes offers genuine conceptual originality. Some familiar beats (widower in garden with memories) prevent higher scoring despite strong execution.</comment>
