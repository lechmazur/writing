<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's warmly inquisitive nature drives the central action of seeking truth through the diary, with clear internal motivation rooted in loyalty and duty. The discovery transforms from public anguish to private maternal hope, creating earned emotional complexity. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "affectionate detachment" at closure rather than more embodied response.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer (elevator ascent, goggles discovery, diary decryption) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's identity shifts from broken captain to protective mother. The cost is legible in "a quiet, desperate act of love" and Kael's burden of secret knowledge. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound spire and crystal elevator create vertical momentum that mirrors Kael's ascension, while the goggles' polarizing function constrains how the diary can be read. Pale sunlight at the third floor triggers the crucial discovery method. Setting doesn't quite reach 9+ as the Grand Archives arrival feels more transitional than constraining.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from duty-bound curiosity through encrypted barrier to the revelation of hidden motherhood, with Kael's agency driving each discovery. The cost lands in his commitment to guard this secret "just as she had." Escalation could be stronger if the discovery created more immediate pressure on Kael's choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of joy beneath anguish emerges organically through the concrete discovery of the child's sketch and hopeful inscription. The final reframing—"not as a tragedy, but as a quiet, desperate act of love"—offers resonant answer without moralizing. The armor/hope duality enriches without oversimplifying.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formality befitting a servant's perspective with selective perception ("familiar, weightless lurch"). The diary entries contrast effectively with narrative voice. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("sacred text of a mother") that slightly exceeds Kael's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variation and strong information density, particularly in the discovery sequence. Some elevated diction ("schematic of polarized hues," "intricate lenses") occasionally slows momentum. No significant loops or scaffolding, though "affectionate detachment" feels slightly abstract for the emotional weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The goggles-as-decoder mechanism offers fresh angle on the encrypted diary trope, grounded in the captain's navigation tools. The mother-in-hiding revelation transforms expected grief narrative. Execution is competent but doesn't quite achieve the bold risk-taking or inevitable synthesis that would elevate further.</comment>
