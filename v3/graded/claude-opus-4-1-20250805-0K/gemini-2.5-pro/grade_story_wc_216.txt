I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through layered meanings around time, memory, and the urn fragment, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration when Kael experiences the preserved memory.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and embodied through his obsession with the urn fragment, and his internal contradiction between feeling time slip away while seeking timelessness drives genuine tension. The final transformation from anxious timekeeper to serene receiver of memory is earned through his persistent quest, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("texture of time passing") rather than fully embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael experiences the preserved memory, transforming his relationship to time with visible emotional cost (his "borrowed time" anxiety dissolves into "serene echo"). The accumulative structure builds coherently through the garage sale gambit to the traveler's message to the silo revelation, with early orientation anchored effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald silo functions as both setting and mechanism, constraining Kael's choices and ultimately revealing itself as a memory resonator. The post-Collapse world where "numbers changed meaning" creates specific pressure, and sensory details like the silo's "low hum deepened into a chord" serve the climactic revelation, though middle sections could sharpen spatial specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding time's texture before Kael's own runs out—intensifies through his desperate garage sale method and culminates when the traveler's message unlocks the silo's purpose. The cost is legible as Kael trades his anxious pursuit for acceptance of preserved moments, though the middle lacks a sharper tightening moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of time's persistence through memory emerges organically from Kael's handling of the urn fragment and crystallizes when he experiences "a pocket of existence outside the flow." The final image of "a thousand other anticipated mysteries" blooming in the walls offers a non-literal answer about how life persists beyond death through preserved moments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent distance with distinctive touches like "longitude was just a word for longing" and modulates effectively during the climactic memory experience. The perceptual signature shows Kael's timekeeper mindset through phrases like "different flavor of decay and growth," though some abstract formulations ("texture of time passing") could be more concretely voiced.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the climactic sequence where short, sensory phrases convey the memory's immediacy. Some abstract phrasing ("fueled his quest," "gnawing sense") and mild redundancy around time concepts prevent higher scoring, but no major loops or scaffolding interfere with momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of a post-Collapse world where mathematical meaning has shifted offers genuine freshness, and the synthesis of time capsule, cremation urn, and memory-storing architecture creates an inevitable-feeling resolution. The garage sale as communication method and the silo as resonator show creative risk-taking that enhances rather than obscures the emotional core.</comment>
