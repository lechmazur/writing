<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through her pursuit of "filament of hush," with internal contradiction between numbness and desperate search for feeling. The audience members' varied physical responses (weeping, self-embrace) show authentic emotional complexity without tidy resolution. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around emotional states ("gray fog of emotional numbness") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where shared vibration transforms collective numbness into "resonant heart of the earth itself," with visible emotional cost paid through tears and physical responses. Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through vibration descriptions toward final reconfiguration. The transformation from "mirrored hush" to filled, warm silence shows legible before/after with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The limestone cavern's acoustic properties directly enable the vibrational method, constraining how music can be experienced. Sensory detail privileges tactile/vibrational over visual/auditory, perfectly aligned with POV's deafness. The broken needle's specific interaction with bass grooves shapes the entire methodology. Setting becomes instrument of transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation as vibrations build from floor to blood to chest, creating shared tactile language that "bypassed the ears entirely." The progression from individual numbness to collective resonance shows clear escalation under textural lens. Cost is visible in the audience's physical responses, though agency reads more as facilitation than decisive action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that silence can be "structured, resonant," not absence but presence. The final image of "quiet, hopeful intake of a new breath" reweights the entire premise without stating a moral. The paradox of a deaf music teacher finding voice "not in the air, but in the resonant heart of the earth" offers non-literal answer to the central question of connection beyond sound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through tactile-dominant sensory hierarchy ("felt the world through the soles of her worn leather boots"). Voice maintains consistent filter of vibrational perception with purposeful elision of auditory detail. Rhythm modulates effectively as vibrations build, though some abstract phrasing ("filament of hush") occasionally strains clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (setting as instrument, object as method). Some figurative density in emotional description ("gray fog," "filament of hush") without full payoff. Prose rhythm effectively mimics vibrational patterns through varied sentence lengths. Minor template tendency in audience reaction sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of deafness and music teaching through vibrational methodology is non-obvious and earned. The specific discovery that backward songs create "strange and compelling unwinding" transforms familiar elements. The broken needle's repurposing from loss to tool shows authentic transformation of trauma.</comment>
