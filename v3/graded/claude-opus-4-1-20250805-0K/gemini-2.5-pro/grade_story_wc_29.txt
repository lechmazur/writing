<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling—outwitting cosmic tricksters before they break humanity—with strong interiority through concrete details like "knot of dread" and "cautiously hopeful flicker." The character makes a decisive choice to interfere using her counter-frequency, showing agency under pressure with visible stakes. Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("cosmic power plays," "neuro-acoustic level") that briefly abstracts the embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal structure with clear Decisive Change: Elara activates her counter-frequency and observes immediate effects as protesters lower signs and confusion replaces fury. The cost is legible—exhausted ache, ongoing vigilance required—and the lens holds as Causal throughout. The closure lands with "she would be here tomorrow night, and the night after, ready," showing both victory and ongoing burden.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The radio station setting effectively constrains choice through its equipment (waveform generator, VU meters) and isolation, making Elara's intervention possible. Sensory details like "dusty bubble of analog warmth," "bakelite cool and solid," and "ozone and dust" create atmosphere while the astronomical charts function as both setting element and tactical tool. The environment directly enables the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from passive observation to active intervention, with clear cost: Elara risks exposure and takes on endless vigilance. The "virulent transmission" correlating with the town hall collapse raises urgency, and her decision "settled not with a crash but with the quiet finality of a closing airlock" shows agency forcing the turn. The tricksters' arrogance creates genuine opposition that Elara must outwit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: individual agency against invisible manipulation, with Elara as "a single person in a forgotten radio room" tipping cosmic scales. The subsonic counter-frequency works as concrete metaphor—imperceptible resistance that "encouraged resonance instead of dissonance." The ending avoids moralizing while showing the cost of vigilance through "quiet hope humming into the divided world."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical register appropriate to Elara's expertise, with selective perception focused on signals and equipment. Perceptual signature strong in lines like "dying stars to the shouting matches" and "cosmic tricksters, bored immortals." Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("quiet finality of a closing airlock") that slightly exceeds the established voice range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose generally clear with good momentum, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("chaotic ocean of paper," "true anchors"). Strong specific details like "spidery annotations" and "bakelite cool" create texture. Deduction for mixed metaphor ("oceanic chaos" vs "anchors" on the wall) and occasional overwriting ("virulent transmission," "ethereal grit") that doesn't fully integrate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle on alien influence through "cosmic tricksters" as bored immortals rather than conquerors, with specific twist of subsonic counter-frequencies as resistance. The correlation between stellar signals and protest groups offers originality. The protagonist's method—using the station's own equipment to create imperceptible resistance—shows ingenuity within established constraints.</comment>
