<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to build identity from collected fragments is compelling and consistent, with embodied emotion in the layering scene. The internal contradiction between erasure and existence drives authentic tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "patchwork soul" construction, though the poison label grounds it with specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with density increase through layered stories culminating in the phantom memory formation. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the layered emotions briefly coalesce around the poison label, creating "a memory, textured and sharp." Cost is felt in the immediate dissolution ("shattering the illusion") and the return to solitude. Orientation anchors (port, containers, narrator's status) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The container labyrinth functions as both physical and metaphorical setting, constraining the narrator's existence to "rust-holes and shadowed canyons." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("brine and diesel," "slick, green-bearded pylons"). The Evergreen container becomes a micro-setting that enables the layering action, while the tidal rhythm structures time and possibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering texture of memories through layering—deepens when the woman's grief adds "vibrant color" to the collection. Escalation occurs through accumulation as fragments coalesce with increasing pressure until the ship's horn breaks the construction. The cost is legible in the return to "silence and the quiet slap of water."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of layering others' stories to construct identity, avoiding abstraction. The poison label serves as the sole anchor to erased history, gaining meaning through accumulated fragments. The ending's "kind of living" achieves resonance without moralizing, embracing the paradox of conscious erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how reality "filters through rust-holes" and sounds carry "the weight of their origins." Voice maintains lyric control through metaphorical precision ("tide breathes," "caesura between shipment"). The shift to present tense for the layering scene effectively modulates psychic distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The ink that declared me gone has more authority than the air in my lungs"). Rhythm varies naturally between longer philosophical passages and shorter action beats. Minor figurative density in places but serves the accumulative pattern without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of existence through death certificate error offers fresh angle on identity construction. The specific method of layering overheard stories to build memory texture shows genuine originality. The transformation of the poison label from static object to vessel for phantom history demonstrates conceptual integrity.</comment>
