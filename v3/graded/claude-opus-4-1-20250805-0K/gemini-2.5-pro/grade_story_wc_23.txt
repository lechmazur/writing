I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and symbolic accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elias transforms grief into purpose.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation crystallizes through embodied grief ("ache of his loss was a physical thing in his chest") and the contradictory impulse to build for others what he cannot have for himself. The final choice to create "a road home for others" demonstrates earned renunciation with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("geography of loss") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias's construction of the signal transforms personal loss into collective solace, with cost visible in "tears trace paths through the grime." The accumulative lens holds as cryptic instructions and symbolic alignments build toward the ethereal light's activation. Slight deduction for the convenience of the midnight calls' perfect timing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The signal station setting actively constrains choice through its "defunct transmitter" parts that must be repurposed, while the bronze censer foot functions as micro-setting that enables the final transformation. Vivid sensory work in "starlight was so bright here it felt solid." Deduction for some vague geography beyond the station.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen effectively as Elias moves from passive grief to active construction, with the bronze foot's placement creating irreversible commitment ("clicked into place with an unnerving finality"). The cost manifests in accepting he "hadn't brought his daughter back" while finding "raw solace" in helping others—a meaningful trade-off that forecloses personal reunion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of building a "lighthouse for those adrift on an ocean of regret," with the bronze foot transforming from mysterious relic to functional component. The final image of "stark and aching comfort" resists tidy resolution while offering resonant answer to loss through service to others.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Elias processes the mystical ("hum with a quiet energy") versus the mechanical ("hydraulics fail"). Voice modulates effectively under pressure, tightening during the rooftop sequence. Deduction for occasional register elevation ("obsidian sky," "patriarch of return") that slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. However, some figurative density in non-peak moments ("skeleton of forgotten ambition," "compass needle shivering") and minor synonym churn around loss/grief concepts. The clarity at closure remains strong with "silent song broadcast into the wasteland."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis in using defunct technology to create spiritual infrastructure, with the cryptic phone calls offering an original method for guidance. The transformation of personal grief into collective navigation shows genuine emotional specificity. Some derivative elements in the post-apocalyptic setting prevent higher scoring.</comment>
