I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story operates through clear because/therefore linkages as Elias's ritual actions lead to the signing.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied psychology through white knuckles, rigid jaw, and trembling hands at closure. The transformation from defiance to surrender is earned through Elias's specific ritual actions. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("masks of granite," "mutual hatred") rather than fully embodied states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change lands with visible cost - two enemies sign a peace treaty after generations of war, with the "profound surrender" and trembling hand showing the price. The causal chain from ritual symbolism to emotional shift to signature is clean. The "difficult work of making this fragile peace real" acknowledges ongoing cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ancient terrace with its crumbling marble and night-blooming jasmine creates atmospheric pressure. The dust ritual constrains the final choice effectively. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Slight deduction for some generic descriptors ("velvet sky," "ethereal shades").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from skepticism through the dust ritual to signing, with the "moment fraying" creating genuine tension. The cost is visible in Vorlag's grunt of "profound surrender" and Kaelen's trembling hand. One meaningful tightening through the ritual that forces the choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of using ancestral dust to bind the treaty, avoiding abstraction. The "flawed beauty" concept manifests in the crumbling terrace hosting new peace. Minor deduction for some explicit thematic statements about redemption's price rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with Elias. Strong perceptual signature in how he reads the generals' body language and calibrates his approach. Some elevated diction ("midwife a peace," "operatively gentle") fits the formal occasion but occasionally feels writerly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Information density is solid with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for some overwriting ("velvet sky," "ethereal shades"), redundant descriptors ("ancient terrace"/"marble...cracked"), and occasional purple patches that slow momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dust ritual as binding agent is a fresh angle on peace negotiations. The specific detail of scraping moss and marble dust to trace the ancient sigil shows originality. However, the Forever War setup and two-generals-meeting framework is somewhat familiar territory.</comment>
