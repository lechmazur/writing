<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to honor overlooked histories drives consistent choices through the lens fragment's guidance to the painting. Internal conflict between surface placidity and hidden truth creates genuine tension in the discovery moment. The final choice to "unfasten the lie" carries visible cost in the "wrenching pull" and transforms both painting and history.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural drive lens builds density through layered imagery (lighthouse/lens/painting/ship) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the painting's correction releases the trapped history. Cost lands explicitly: "the long moment between their then and my now had finally, mercifully, come to an end" shows temporal and emotional weight. The lens fragment's transformation from "heavy" to "lighter" physicalizes the change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The alchemist's market creates immediate atmosphere with "bottled starlight" and "whisper-thin map of a dream," establishing rules for this liminal space. The lighthouse lens fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining how truth can be perceived and enabling the final unfastening. Sensory details ("linseed oil and ozone") anchor the ethereal in physical specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes build from personal mission through discovery of the deliberately wrong painting to the active unfastening of historical lies. The "wrenching pull, not of thread but of reality itself" shows clear escalation with protagonist agency. Cost registers in the transformation of both painting and lens, though middle pressure could intensify.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of overlooked histories emerges through concrete action—the lens revealing the St. Elmo beneath false waves—rather than declaration. The final image of the lens becoming "lighter" after serving its purpose resonates without moralizing. Subtext operates through the painting's deliberate errors as "keyhole" to truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends concrete ("heavy curve of glass") with ethereal ("smoke you could almost hold"), maintaining consistency through pressure. POV modesty calibrated well—the narrator infers meaning from visual evidence without claiming omniscience. The lyrical register suits the between-worlds translator's perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong moments like "bruised purple sky" and "reef that should have jutted from the sea like a broken tooth" show specificity. Some filter-verb clustering ("seemed to thin," "seemed to shift") dulls immediacy in the transformation sequence. Minor paraphrase loop with "overlooked history"/"forgotten crew" concepts, though the final image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of truth hidden in painting errors offers fresh angle on historical recovery. The lighthouse keeper's lens as inherited tool for seeing differently transforms a potential cliché into specific, earned revelation. Risk-taking in the ethereal market setting heightens the liminal stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
