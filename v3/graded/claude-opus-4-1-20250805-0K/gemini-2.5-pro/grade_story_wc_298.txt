I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is a **Causal** story - each beat follows because/therefore logic as Aris's actions directly respond to and attempt to repair the consequences of his bargain.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is crystal clear with layered internal conflict between guilt and desperate hope. The "fiercely gentle" paradox manifests beautifully in his tender violence against the void. Minor deduction for slight emotional smoothness in processing complex guilt while performing delicate work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from bargain to void to active repair, with Resonant Reconfiguration closure as the burned card transforms from penance to guardian. Cost is visible in the sacrificed memory and ongoing commitment. The piece teaches its metaphysical rules early and pays them off precisely.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is magnificently realized - phosphorescent moss, silver-barked saplings feeding on "concluded stories," mineral-rich bones. Setting constrains choice when the femur provides crucial nourishment and the underground location shapes the shadow-void's manifestation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds causally from recognition of shadow to panic to resolution through sacrifice. The protagonist's agency drives the turn - offering his academy memory as "balm" rather than bargain. Cost is legible in the permanent loss of his brightest moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "patching holes in the soul" via physical tending. The burned tarot card's transformation from mark of failure to guard stone offers resonant non-literal answer about transmuting guilt into protection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent POV. "Marrow-rich soil," "concluded stories," "negative space of his bartered future" show unique perceptual signature. Slight deduction for minor register elevation ("trammel," "burgeoning") that occasionally exceeds character lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong prose with varied rhythm and high information density. Beautiful precision in "the phosphorescent moss on the ceiling casting long, skeletal shadows." Minor deductions for slight overwriting in places ("cloying voice of the entity") and one instance of mild redundancy ("guilt and the grief").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of tarot symbolism, soul-gardening, and catacomb ecology. The concept of trees feeding on dead stories while Aris patches spiritual voids through memory-sacrifice is genuinely fresh. Risk-taking in the metaphysical mechanics pays off with coherent internal logic.</comment>
