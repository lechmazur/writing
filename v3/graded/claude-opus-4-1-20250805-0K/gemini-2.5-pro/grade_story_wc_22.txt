I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation as "quiet atonement for a war he hadn't fought" drives clear, consistent choices throughout. His internal state manifests through embodied action—kneeling with reverence, fingers working soil into stone—rather than emotional labels. The birds' guidance creates genuine external pressure that shapes his tactical choices, though the piece lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure: "He had planted a garden on a gravestone, a narrow line of hope against the vast and silent dark." The cost is legible—his aching back, the "gravestone" metaphor acknowledging what cannot be restored. The piece teaches its pattern early (alien blossoms pulsing, dead ocean) and pays it off through accumulated density.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint and enabler throughout—the jetty's fissures determine planting locations, the birds' memory of underwater geography guides seed selection. The "narrow vastness" paradox is embodied in the physical space. Sensory hierarchy reflects the coachman's professional priorities: tactile details of soil and stone dominate over visual description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (atonement through restoration) deepens through accumulation rather than reversal, fitting the textural lens. The birds' guidance creates genuine pressure that narrows his options—"Three paces west" determines action. Cost accumulates through physical toll and the acknowledgment that he cannot resurrect what was lost, only translate it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of translation—dead languages becoming living instruction, "submerged concord" translated into "a new tongue." The final image of planting "a garden on a gravestone" offers a resonant, non-literal answer about transformation versus resurrection. No explicit moralizing; complexity preserved in the tension between hope and acknowledgment of loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout—the coachman processes the world through tactile and auditory channels more than visual. The birds' language translation is handled with controlled uncertainty ("one sequence of calls translated in his mind"). Prose rhythm modulates effectively between meditative passages and active planting sequences.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The long jetty, a stone finger pointing into the corpse of the sea" establishes setting, tone, and theme simultaneously. Some elevated diction ("chemiluminescent," "tabernacle") fits the mythic register. Minor weakness in the slightly repetitive "He had not... but he had" construction in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of ecological restoration with linguistic archaeology is genuinely fresh—birds as "ocean's frantic librarians" screaming "last remembered verses." The specific seed-to-location matching based on translated bird calls transforms the expected restoration narrative. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and mythic register heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
