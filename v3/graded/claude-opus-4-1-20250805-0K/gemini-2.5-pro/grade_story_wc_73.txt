<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's grim optimism manifests through sustained mathematical obsession despite infinite imprisonment, with contradictory impulses (seeking texture of failure while risking self-unraveling) acting simultaneously. The final choice to continue searching earns its cost through the agonizing perfect recall of his original failure, though some interiority edges toward abstract philosophy rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as mathematical proofs accumulate toward the rupture at "seven," delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elian transforms prison into canvas with visible emotional cost ("fresh wound in his soul"). The closure lands with earned transformation, though the precise nature of the original "missed opportunity" remains slightly opaque.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The infinite staircase functions as both setting and constraint, with scratched formulas transforming stone into workspace and the "geometry of sameness" pressuring Elian's method. Sensory details of the rupture moment ("damp chill," "rain on asphalt," "click of a lock") provide visceral contrast to the sterile infinity, directly constraining his final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from mapping impossible physics to risking self-unraveling ("prodding a sleeping god"), with the seven-roll creating genuine rupture that delivers the sought texture at agonizing cost. The transformation from prison to canvas represents meaningful deepening, though middle development could tighten between setup and climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of perfection containing flaws, with the chipped die embodying corruption within systems and the final image reweighting imprisonment as creative possibility. The story resists simple escape narrative for complex exploration of how failure textures existence, though some philosophical passages approach direct statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent philosophical register with distinctive perceptual signature ("geography of sameness," "dissecting its ghost"), modulating effectively during the rupture sequence. Some passages drift toward elevated abstraction ("esoteric," "ephemeral") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon, and filter constructions occasionally distance immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the rupture sequence's sensory cascade. However, abstract philosophical passages ("monument to perpetual motion," "physical embodiment of probability") occasionally slow momentum, and some elevated diction ("balancedly daring," "unwavering rhythm") creates mild register friction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of using mathematical proofs to rupture infinity offers fresh angle on imprisonment narrative, with the chipped die as corrupting variable showing specific invention. The transformation from prison to canvas through logic touching the illogical demonstrates non-obvious synthesis, though some philosophical framing feels familiar.</comment>
