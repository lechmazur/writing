<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's paradoxical identity as "chaste courtesan" creates genuine internal tension, with her deliberate withholding shown through "bodily poetic" movement rather than told. The thread-untangling sequence embodies contradictory impulses effectively—hesitation over her own silver thread shows earned cost. Minor deduction for slight abstractness in emotional states ("sharp, cold thing within her") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with threads literally accumulating into transformation. The prism's dissolution creates clear Decisive Change with visible cost—Elara becomes conduit for "thousand subdued lives." Orientation anchors cleanly (courtyard, moonlit snow, Elara at center). The "harvest of echoes" returning to owners satisfies closure with felt weight of "might-have-beens."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary's "solidified starlight" and "luminous threads" constrain Elara's choices—she must untangle rather than force. Snow's transformation from "crunching" to "sighing" tracks environmental response to her actions. The silver courtyard frames and mirrors the final silver thread, charging the ending image of her "true smile" reflected in ice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through thread accumulation—cobalt poet, vermilion warrior—each increasing the "torrent of might-have-beens" flowing through Elara. The final silver thread as her own echo creates meaningful tightening with visible cost. Agency manifests through deliberate untangling despite "exquisitely painful" resistance, foreclosing her gilded cage path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: each thread represents "silenced possibilities," making conformity's lullaby tangible. The final image of Elara's "true smile" replacing her performed existence resonates without stating a moral. "Alarming serenity of immense potential" reweights the opening's "unblemished blanket" as suffocating rather than peaceful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevation ("stark contradiction in silk and resolve"). Some register drift into abstract philosophy ("terrifying quiet of a blank page") slightly disconnects from Elara's embodied perspective. Strong perceptual signature in how she experiences threads as memories. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some elevated diction approaches purple ("languid and deliberate dance that spoke of grace and unspoken depth"). Information density high in thread-untangling sequence. Minor abstract scaffolding ("quality of light," "impossible geometry") and one paraphrase loop ("silenced all dissent"/"the lullaby").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prism as repository of surrendered choices offers fresh angle on breaking conformity—not destruction but careful untangling. "Chaste courtesan" as deliberate paradox avoiding typical tropes. The specific thread-memories (poet choosing ledgers, warrior choosing plow) ground the abstract concept in lived particulars.</comment>
