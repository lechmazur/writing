<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving knowledge before oblivion—and her "gently meticulous" trait manifests in concrete actions throughout. The transformation from passive archivist to active resurrector is earned through discovery and methodical action, with visible cost in the library's waiting state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through frequency sampling to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the library's true purpose reweights everything prior. The closure lands with clear cost—the library's frozen stasis as a "long sleep" waiting for resurrection—and Elara's role transforms from preserver to awakener.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen library setting directly constrains action through "measured decay" and "slow entropy," while the crystal architecture and "quartz hush" create atmospheric pressure throughout. Setting elements like the photic resonator and starlight harmonics enable key plot mechanics, though some descriptions edge toward ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from preserving dying knowledge to discovering the library's living purpose, with pressure building through the meticulous frequency sampling process. The cost is legible in the library's stasis and the spent slide, though agency remains somewhat passive through the discovery process.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between death/preservation and life/resurrection, with the luminous vows serving as both literal plot device and thematic embodiment. The final realization that the library is "slumbering" rather than dying resonantly reframes the entire narrative without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with elevated, precise diction matching Elara's role, though it occasionally drifts into overly ornate territory ("monument to knowledge suspended between sky and star"). The "gently meticulous" register holds through action descriptions, but lacks distinctive personality markers beyond professional precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from ornamental phrases like "quartz hush of settling ice" and occasional redundancy ("measured decay"/"slow entropy"). Some metaphors strain clarity ("sampling frequencies" process), and filter constructions ("she knew," "she saw") diminish immediacy in key discovery moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of a frozen library preserving luminous vows offers fresh angle on archive stories, with the frequency-sampling method providing original discovery mechanism. The transformation from tomb to "slumbering world of light" subverts expectations, though some elements feel derivative of fantasy library tropes.</comment>
