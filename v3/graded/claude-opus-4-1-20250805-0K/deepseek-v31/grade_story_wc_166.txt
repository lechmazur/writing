<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to create forbidden art as rebellion is clear and consistent, with embodied tension in "a spark of lightning against her thigh, a pain that was both anchor and release." The internal contradiction between exile and creation drives meaningful choice. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "obsidian grace" and "liquid silence" that lean toward atmosphere over embodied emotion in early beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Aria transforms from exile to cosmic constellation through the tattoo's completion. The moonstone dust creating internal shift ("a profound shift occurred within her") provides visible transformation with cost (pain, exile, forbidden act). Orientation anchors solidly by paragraph two.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The twilight garden setting constrains the work to starlight conditions and provides the necessary isolation for forbidden art. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("star-fed blooms opened their petals only under the firmament's dim glow"). The moonstone cabochon grinding and needle work show lived-in tactile engagement that shapes the central action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing forbidden art as rebellion—escalates through accumulating pain and risk ("Each puncture was a step in a forgotten dance"). The nostalgia ban provides coherent background pressure. Cost is visible in physical pain and the permanence of exile, though the external threat remains abstract rather than immediate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the act of inscription—memory and identity preserved through bodily art despite authoritarian erasure. The final transformation ("She was a constellation") offers resonant answer without stating moral. The "verse...not written in words, but in symbols" elegantly avoids didactic explanation while maintaining thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with distinctive perceptual signature in cosmic/tidal imagery ("Her hands did not tremble" shows controlled focalization). Voice modulates effectively with intensity, from meditative opening to transcendent conclusion. Some elevated diction ("obsidian grace," "firmament") fits the character's artistic sensibility though occasionally borders on purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm that mirrors the tattoo process. Information density is generally high ("The ink was a tide locked under her skin, a permanent dance"). Minor deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("obsidian grace," "liquid silence") and slight redundancy in cosmic imagery that doesn't always advance pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fusion of tattoo art with cosmic rebellion and tide dancing offers fresh synthesis of familiar elements. The specific detail of moonstone-ground ink binding "celestial to earthly" shows originality. The concept of tattooing as both preservation and transformation of forbidden cultural memory provides non-obvious angle on resistance narrative.</comment>
