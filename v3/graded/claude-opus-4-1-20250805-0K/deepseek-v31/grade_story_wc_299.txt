Looking at this story, I'll evaluate it under a **Causal lens** - the narrative follows clear because/therefore linkages from Silas's public failure through his discovery of Leo's letters to his final realization about purpose.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("metallic taste of public failure," fingers brushing speaker cloth) and a well-earned final realization. The character's emotional insulation through facts and his breakthrough feel authentic. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of the discovery, but the transformation from defensive cataloguing to understanding his true purpose lands with genuine cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain from failure → defensive work → discovery → revelation about purpose, with visible emotional cost in confronting Leo's death. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) works well - Silas moves from "insulating emotionally with facts" to understanding he's "preserving their stories." The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3, and the drive lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details like "cathedral of rust and silence" and "rock dust perpetually embedded in his knuckles" create atmosphere while advancing character psychology. The quarry setting constrains choices and provides the discovery space. The speaker cloth functions as micro-setting that charges the final realization about preservation versus insulation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding purpose after failure) escalates cleanly from defensive cataloguing to active discovery to transformative understanding. The cost is legible - Silas must confront twenty years of emotional avoidance and his friend's death. The tightening from external shame to internal reckoning works well under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between "insulating with facts" and genuine engagement with stories. The final realization that he's "preserving their stories, their unfulfilled purposes" resonates without stating a moral. The speaker cloth and sheet music create a meaningful pattern about what remains after performance ends.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signature ("metallic taste," "tomb for his former life"). Some elevated diction in emotional peaks ("cathedral of rust," "synaptic echo") slightly exceeds the character's established register. Strong control of psychic distance, particularly in the discovery sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("gargantuan skeletons of excavators"). Minor template cadence in "He had to... He laid it... He looked back..." sequence. The phrase "confidently uncertain" feels forced. Information density is solid, with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle on the after-fame narrative through the specific lens of an antiques appraiser confronting unfinished art. The discovery of Leo's vulnerable letters and unfinished song provides genuine surprise. The synthesis of preservation work with emotional processing feels earned, though the setup is somewhat familiar.</comment>
