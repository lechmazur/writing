<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's internal journey from "fierce repose" as anguish to peace earned creates genuine character arc with visible cost. The fidgeting with the platinum labyrinth embodies his anxiety concretely throughout. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient epiphany about being "a player" which could use more embodied struggle, though the final self-forgiveness lands with earned weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-break closure when Kael places the labyrinth and time resumes. The cost is legible in "The weight in his chest, a constant companion for a decade, was gone" - emotional release through accepting his mistake. The tapestry-as-map revelation drives meaningful escalation toward the keystone discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Still-Ford's temporal stasis creates palpable atmosphere with "gelid, breathless stasis" and frozen villagers. The tapestry functions as micro-setting that constrains choice when Kael must decode it. Deduction for the storm that "never arrived" not having clearer spatial/physical reality, though the village square's plinth payoff lands well.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through decoding the tapestry to discovering the plinth's purpose, with Kael's agency driving each step. The dominant stake of breaking the curse/finding absolution tightens when he realizes he's "not just a prisoner" but "a player." Cost appears in risking his only comfort object to potentially fail, though the resolution could show more immediate trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through applied skill emerges organically as Kael uses the chess strategy that once failed him to solve the puzzle. The labyrinth-as-keystone creates resonant closure without stating a moral. Strong thematic coherence in "mended a thread" echoing both tapestry and his fractured past.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with elevated diction fitting an exiled strategist ("gelid," "winnow"). Some register drift into overly ornate territory ("cosmological schema") that slightly distances from Kael's emotional state. The perceptual signature of seeing patterns and strategic possibilities everywhere supports character, though peak moments could compress more under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Deductions for density issues: "fierce repose" appears twice verbatim; some overwriting in phrases like "woven hush, a silence so profound and intricate it felt spun from invisible thread." The filter-verb stack "He understood...He had to separate...He had to decode" dulls immediacy in a crucial realization beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The time-frozen village with selective animation (the fraying thread) offers a fresh angle on exile stories. The tapestry-as-cosmic-map and labyrinth-as-key create specific world logic. Transformation of chess strategy into magical problem-solving shows originality, though the redemption arc itself follows familiar patterns.</comment>
