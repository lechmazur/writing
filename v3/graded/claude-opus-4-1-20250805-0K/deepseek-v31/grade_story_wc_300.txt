<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deepens from collector to conduit through embodied discovery. The pearl's sensory memory creates genuine internal conflict between her walled-off heart and emerging purpose. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "dissolve the walls between hearts" not fully grounded until the pearl moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost as the old woman receives the pearl and decades of separation dissolve in shared light. The causal chain from bunker inspection to pearl discovery to delivery is clean. The "wall between their two hearts... vanished completely" provides clear before/after with emotional cost paid on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Crystal caves and geode mouth constrain discovery; the pearl's "latent radiance" charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (Geiger clicks, resonant hush, moon-colored light). The apartment museum of fragments adds texture without overwhelming the central beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from collecting artifacts to becoming a conduit when the pearl reveals its method. The confession creates pressure that forces Elara's choice to find and deliver it. Cost is visible in the old woman's tears and the dissolution of decades of separation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The pearl as "crown" of suffering transformed into love resonates through concrete action. Theme emerges from the specific discovery and delivery without moralizing. The final image of walls dissolving between hearts reweights all prior collecting as preparation for this singular act of connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "resonant hush" and "fragmented dreams." POV is stable with controlled psychic distance. Some register drift toward abstract philosophical language ("dissolve the walls between hearts") not fully grounded in Elara's inspector persona.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean but contains loops: "resonant hush" appears twice, "dissolve/dissolving walls" repeats the same metaphor. Template cadence in "She went... She knocked... She simply opened." Information density is moderate; some sentences do single duty where compression could heighten impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cultivated pearl inside a bunker geode is genuinely unexpected. The concept of collecting "abandoned hopes" as emotional artifacts transforms the bunker inspector role. The specific detail of confession etched in nacre creates fresh texture on familiar themes of love and reconciliation.</comment>
