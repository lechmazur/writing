I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and revelation toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than strict causal progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through her nocturnal flower question, with internal contradiction between her vibrant external work and internal emptiness. The final choice to paint the cosmic diagram with gratitude rather than sadness shows earned transformation with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("kaleidoscope of unspent color") that doesn't fully embody the character state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara reinterprets her grandmother's absence as gravitational love rather than abandonment, with emotional cost visible in her shift from sadness to gratitude. The accumulative structure coheres through the cathedral revelation that reweights prior material. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (amber pavilion's function unclear initially) and some causality softness in how the cathedral visit transforms into cosmic understanding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The amber pavilion and cathedral settings actively shape choices - the damaged mural panel drives the cathedral visit, and the stained glass mechanism constrains how revelation occurs. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("diluted by the lingering morning mist"). The cosmic diagram discovery wouldn't work without the specific cathedral architecture, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding emptiness through the flower question) tightens when the cathedral light reveals the cosmic diagram, forcing Elara to reckon with her grandmother's true intention. Cost is visible in the emotional transformation from isolation to connection. The escalation is more accumulative than causal, appropriate for the textural lens but lacking a sharp reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the nocturnal flower metaphor - hidden forces nurturing growth in darkness. The grandmother's postcards-as-gravitational-pull avoids explicit moralizing while offering a non-literal answer to why beauty blooms unseen. The final image of Elara as "a nocturnal flower finally turning its face toward the moon" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("All around her, the world held its breath in a dawning hush"). POV remains stable with appropriate focalization. Some elevated diction ("umbral tenderness," "kaleidoscope of unspent color") occasionally strains against naturalism but serves the textural mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("silent, respectful pause between seasons") with varied syntax and rhythm. Deductions for abstract metaphors that reduce clarity ("soul was a kaleidoscope of unspent color"), occasional overwriting in figurative density, and some elevated register drift ("umbral tenderness") that doesn't fully integrate with POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal flower/gravitational love synthesis offers a fresh angle on absence and connection. The cathedral's hidden etching layers provide an original revelation mechanism. Some derivative elements (artist seeking meaning through restoration) but transformed through specific cosmic imagery and the grandmother-as-moon metaphor.</comment>
