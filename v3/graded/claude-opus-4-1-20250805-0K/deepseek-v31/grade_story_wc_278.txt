I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered sonic metaphors and resonance patterns toward a final harmonizing that reweights Elara's guilt.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (etching copper plates, using the amber translator). The internal contradiction between seeking silence while perpetually hearing guilt manifests throughout. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "constellation tattooist" metaphor that doesn't fully ground in physical reality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure building from guilt-as-dissonance through spectral haunting to final harmonizing. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost - the ghost is "laid to rest" not erased, transformed into "a new fixed star." The lens holds consistently throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The laboratory setting with "brass horns, wax cylinders, and spider-webbed wires" creates atmosphere while constraining method. The amber translator and copper plates function as micro-settings that enable the resolution. Spatial choreography during the etching sequence is clear and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from internal dissonance to external haunting ("The machine was haunted, its firmware corrupted not by a virus, but by a memory"). The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through deliberate binding rather than erasure. Cost is visible in accepting rather than silencing the guilt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the sonic metaphor system - silence vs. noise, haunting vs. harmony. The final image of the ghost "laid to rest...finally hushed into harmony" offers a non-literal answer about integration over erasure. No explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical register ("meteor hush," "constellation tattooist"). Some register elevation ("sacrament," "spectral") fits the lyrical mode. Minor overwriting in places ("cluttered cavern") but rhythm modulates effectively with emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple layers. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("cluttered cavern of brass horns"), some abstract phrasing ("quantum trick"), and slight metaphor density in non-peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound engineering with emotional haunting creates an original premise. The amber translator as penance tool and the grandmother's acoustic binding theory show inventive detail. The resolution through harmonizing rather than silencing avoids expected patterns.</comment>
