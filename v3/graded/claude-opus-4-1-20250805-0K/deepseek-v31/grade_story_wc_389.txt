<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cassian's internal conflict between belonging (joining the Aerie) and solitary vision crystallizes with genuine cost at closure, particularly in "gritty resolve hardened within him, a choice made not from whim, but from the core of his vision." The loneliness amplifying temptation and the final smile "alone, but no longer lonely" earns the character arc through specific dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change occurs when Cassian amplifies the prophet's frequency over the Aerie's, with immediate cost (console sparking, darkness) and lasting transformation (storm breaking, new day shaped). The causal chain from discovery through temptation to decisive action holds firmly, with the "perfect, complete stanza of weather and time" paying off the Codex Tempestas setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico functions as both setting and active element, transforming from storm-battered shelter to prism that "unfolds a spectrum of impossible colors" at closure. The observatory's brass mechanisms, vacuum tubes, and crystal receiver create tactile specificity that constrains Cassian's method while the storm's progression shapes scene pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from solitary listening to competitive faction pressure when the Aerie discovers the transmissions, forcing Cassian's choice between "power, resources" and the "fragmented path." The simultaneous voices creating "dissonant roar that threatened to shatter his mind" effectively tightens pressure, with the cost visible in the sparking console and temporary darkness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between control and understanding, with the final spectrum through the cobalt glass offering a non-literal answer about transformation through solitary vision. The "new day...shaped by ancient shadows and a lonely man's choice" resists easy moralizing while the contrast between the Aerie's force and the prophet's fragmented wisdom avoids false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the visionary character, with effective modulation during peak stress ("With a muttered oath that was equal parts prayer and curse"). Some filter-verb clustering ("Cassian felt," "He could serve") slightly dulls immediacy, though the perceptual signature of translating static into meaning remains distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "each lightning strike a momentary sun," though occasional overwriting appears ("brutal pull of variant allegiance, a tear in his very soul"). Minor template cadence in "He could serve...or he could follow" structure and some abstract phrasing ("variant allegiance") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of finding prophecy through radio static offers fresh specificity, transforming the visionary-in-tower trope through technical particulars (crystal receiver, frequency dial, vacuum tubes). The final image of the observatory as prism creating "impossible colors" provides an earned, non-obvious synthesis of the storm/technology/transformation elements.</comment>
