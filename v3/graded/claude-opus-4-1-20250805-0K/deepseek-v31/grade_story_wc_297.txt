<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's contradictory impulses of "anxious elation" and "dread and desperate hope" act simultaneously throughout, with her final choice to complete the scarring pattern earned through established covenant logic. The cost—fresh pain and renewed binding—is viscerally felt through "deliberate incision across her old wounds."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as symbolic density increases toward the climactic blood-binding that transforms Lyra from "held" to "hold it all together"—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost in the cutting. The eclipse-covenant-scar pattern coheres causally, though the intersection's nature could be clearer earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glade functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—Lyra literally cannot leave its "twilight borders"—and the plinth/stone become tools enabling the final transformation. Sensory detail like "cobalt," "indigo," "phosphorescent" creates atmosphere, though some descriptions lean purple ("silent astronomical concord").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure escalates from mysterious summons through eclipse arrival to the necessity of blood sacrifice, with Lyra's agency driving the resolution through deliberate self-cutting. The cost is unmistakable—physical pain and renewed binding—though the stakes of what happens if she refuses remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ending reweights bondage as connection without stating a moral—Lyra discovers her purpose is "not to be held, but to hold it all together." The scar motif accumulates meaning from prison-mark to connection-method to conductor's baton, though some thematic articulation borders on explicit ("finally whole").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Lyra's synesthetic awareness ("cobalt embrace," "pull of the glade") and her root-bound perspective colors descriptions. Some passages drift into elevated register ("celestial dance," "symphony of fear and wonder") that strains against immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, but overwriting appears in phrases like "silent astronomical concord" and "crystalline elation." Template structures emerge in the vision list ("a falling star, a laughing child, a city of glass") and some metaphor mixing ("symphony" shifts to "conductor" to "anchor").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The root-bound visionary concept offers a fresh angle on chosen-one narratives, with the physical scarring-as-connection method providing specificity. However, the dream intersection concept and eclipse-triggered transformation follow familiar fantasy patterns without sufficient transformation through lived detail.</comment>
