I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aeliana's motivation is crystal clear with concrete stakes, and her methodical approach reveals character through action. The internal work of "mapping silence" shows sophisticated interiority without diagnostic labels. Minor deduction for the prophecy's somewhat abstract nature limiting embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with closure landing as Resonant Reconfiguration—the prophecy hushed to "harmless, forgotten dream" with clear cost paid through Aeliana's exhaustive effort. The paper wing's subtle movements effectively track progress. Orientation anchors established within first 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven functions as more than backdrop—the brook provides metronome rhythm that enables her work, while the "smoothed hush" she cultivated constrains her method. Sensory details filtered through POV priorities. Setting directly enables the silencing technique.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes established immediately as "terrestrial rearrangement of catastrophic proportions." Escalation tracks through mapping the prophecy's shape, finding its core syllable, then the final concentrated effort of "silent supernova." Cost visible in the methodical, "agonizingly slow" work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of using silence as power, never stated directly. The paper wing's incompleteness ("potential, a gesture paused mid-beat") resonates with the larger question of intervention versus prevention. Final image reweights the opening without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third with controlled psychic distance, particularly strong in passages like "tranquil blaze, cool and focused." Perceptual signature evident in how she experiences the prophecy as "tangled, glowing knot." Some elevated diction ("terrestrially cosmic") stays within magical practitioner's lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, especially in the climactic paragraph's building intensity. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("paradox of immense power") and slight repetition of "quiet/silence" vocabulary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of silencing rather than preventing prophecy offers fresh angle on familiar magical confrontation. Specific detail of the incomplete origami wing as focus object shows originality. However, solitary magic-user versus cosmic threat remains somewhat within genre conventions despite the unique approach.</comment>
