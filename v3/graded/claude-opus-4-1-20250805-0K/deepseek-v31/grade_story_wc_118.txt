I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered discoveries and reflections toward a resonant reconfiguration where Alistair transforms from collector to "wall" himself.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation crystallizes beautifully from collector to living repository, with genuine internal contradiction between grief and purpose. The transformation feels earned through concrete discoveries, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("profound grief settled over him").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Alistair becomes "the wall" with clear cost (accepting role as tomb's scribe). The accumulative structure coheres well through diary discoveries to final stance, though the displaced axis concept could integrate more causally with the present action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The silo library functions as more than setting—its "bronze quiet" and circular walls ascending into darkness mirror and constrain Alistair's realization. Sensory details (aged paper, cold concrete) and the tapestry fragment actively shape his final understanding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen effectively from personal collection to existential preservation, with the diary discoveries tightening pressure toward Alistair's transformation. Cost is visible in accepting his role as "faithful scribe" to a dead world, though middle escalation could sharpen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of walls hearing stories, culminating in Alistair becoming the wall himself. The displaced axis concept enriches without over-explaining, and the final image of recording "bronze quiet for whatever came next" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm ("bronze quiet," "density of silence") that modulates effectively with discovery. POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature, though occasional register elevation ("metaphysical tilting") slightly strains the established texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("oak desk carved from a pew," "blistered leather covers"). Some redundancy appears ("profound grief" after showing grief, "frantic purpose" after showing franticness) and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic trope through the concept of dreams as connective tissue to magic, with the historian-as-wall transformation feeling both surprising and inevitable. The "displaced axis" as metaphysical rather than physical offers genuine originality.</comment>
