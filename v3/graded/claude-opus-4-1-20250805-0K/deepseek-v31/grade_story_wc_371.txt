I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern recognition rather than strict causality, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the hidden sacred is revealed.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation manifests through concrete actions (guerrilla gardening, daily tea house visits, carrying the petrified bread) with internal contradictions between decay-noticing and hope-seeking. The final choice to join Kael's counter-spell gardening earns its weight through prior established patterns. Minor deduction for Kael's limited interiority despite his pivotal role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully when Kael uncloaks the world, revealing the sacred hidden in apparent decay—a perfect reversal that reweights everything prior. The cost is legible in "tenuous absolution" requiring continued belief and active tending. The accumulative lens holds as patterns of decay/renewal build to this crystallized moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The overgrown courtyard transforms from neglected ruin to "meticulously curated" sacred space, with every detail recontextualized (weeds as rare herbs, choking vines as deliberate choices). This environmental reversal directly constrains and shapes the final choice to tend the garden. The bread's transformation from petrified to warm exemplifies setting-as-character.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to shared resistance against "creeping normality," with the revelation deepening rather than reversing the conflict. The cost of maintaining this sacred space—"tenuous absolution" dependent on continued belief—is clear. The final planting of saffron crocuses shows agency through collective action against decay.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the bread's transformation and the hidden garden's revelation—the sacred persists "cloaked, waiting for those with eyes gentle enough to see." The ending reweights all prior decay imagery without stating a moral, offering genuine complexity about preservation versus acceptance of loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in Elara's noticing of decay and Kael's "heuristically gentle" movements. Dialogue feels natural when it appears ("They see only a ruin"). Deduction for occasional register elevation ("quiet attrition of magic") and some filter-verb clustering that dulls immediacy in middle passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, but "heuristically gentle" appears twice verbatim, and phrases like "creeping normality" and "quiet attrition" edge toward academic register. Some redundancy in describing the courtyard's transformation. Information density is good but inconsistent, with occasional scaffolding around the theme.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concealed sacred garden and preservation-through-illusion offers a fresh angle on resistance narratives. The petrified bread becoming warm is a specific, memorable image. However, the guerrilla gardening frame is somewhat familiar, and the revelation structure follows recognizable patterns without significant transformation.</comment>
