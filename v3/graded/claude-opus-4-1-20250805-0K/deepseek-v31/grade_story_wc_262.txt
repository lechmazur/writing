I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered sensory and emotional details toward a resonant reconfiguration where unused love is released through projection.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "find where unused love is stored" drives consistent choices through psychometry, with concrete embodied perception ("shiver of prescience raced up her arm"). The projectionist's backstory love letters provide earned emotional weight. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("aching motivation") but the closure choice to project the film is fully motivated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where projecting the film releases stored love "like a vast, beating heart." The accumulative lens holds as density increases through sensory layers. Cost is visible in the projectionist's archived emotion and Elara's ceremonial act. Orientation anchored clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The projection booth setting directly constrains choices - the dead projector creates the problem, the film reel enables the solution. Vivid sensory detail ("dust, hot metal, and old celluloid") filtered through Elara's psychometric perception. The booth-as-tomb metaphor charges the final image of resurrection through projection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from fixing a projector to discovering archived love through psychometric deepening. The pressure coheres as Elara moves from touching the film can to threading celluloid to entering memory space. Cost is legible in the projectionist's unused love and Elara's choice to release it rather than possess it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of "where unused love is stored" emerges through concrete discovery - love archived in film through repeated handling. The final image of the projector as "beating heart" offers a non-literal answer that love persists in created works. No moralizing; the revelation lands through image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's spatial imagination seeing "echoes of moments...as vast, navigable landscapes." Clean free indirect style tracks her psychometric journey. Some elevated diction ("formidable projector") fits the ceremonial tone. Minor register drift in places but voice coheres under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some overwriting appears ("hushed thunder...rumbled beneath"). Information density high in psychometric sequences. Template cadence in "She found...She focused...She understood" sequence (-0.4). Some abstract phrasing ("aching motivation") but momentum sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry with cinema creates non-obvious angle on archived emotion. The specific twist that love is stored through repeated film handling feels earned. Risk-taking in the abstract memory-space sequence pays off. Transforms the "lost love letter" trope through the projectionist's craft.</comment>
