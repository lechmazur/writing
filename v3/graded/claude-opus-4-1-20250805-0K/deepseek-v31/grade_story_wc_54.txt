I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—from surveying to resurrection—with her "functionally creative" trait driving meaningful choices. The internal conflict between professional duty and visionary impulse plays out through embodied choices, though some interiority veers toward abstraction ("equations for hope"). Her final stance represents earned transformation with visible cost in effort and risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal drive: discovery leads to understanding leads to action leads to transformation. The closure lands as Decisive Change—the terminal physically and conceptually transforms from "tomb" to "refuge/harbor," with clear before/after legibility. The cost manifests in Elara's labor and the risk of unauthorized modification. Minor orientation wobble with "spaceport passenger terminal" emerging late after "station."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint and enabler—the maze architecture, hidden hydraulics, and carnival's abandoned capacitors all shape tactical choices. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through narrow conduits to revealed atrium. The transformed space in the final image ("clear dome at the endless stars") charges the closure with specificity. Some descriptive phrases lean generic ("grimy ceramite tiles").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional survey to puzzle-solving to active resurrection, with each phase narrowing options. The sextant discovery triggers investigation, which reveals the hydraulic system, forcing a choice between documentation and transformation. Cost accumulates through physical effort and professional risk. The tension could sharpen further—the "hours tracing pipes" compresses what could be more immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of dead/abandoned into living/potential without explicit moralizing. The sextant as key, the maze's "intentions," and redirected flows create a coherent pattern about repurposing and seeing beyond surface decay. The final image of "silence...full of waiting" resonates thematically. Some phrasing edges toward abstraction ("equations for hope") rather than staying grounded in particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical-poetic register appropriate to an engineer who sees patterns others miss. Perceptual signature shows in how Elara notices structural details and potential rather than decay. Some sentences achieve rhythmic control ("The carnival was gone, but something far less transient now remained"), though others lean formulaic ("Her curiosity, sharp and precise, engaged fully").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance story or atmosphere. Some abstraction creeps in ("equations for hope," "skeleton waiting for a new nervous system") that could be more concrete. The final paragraph achieves strong momentum, though middle sections occasionally drag with process description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of an abandoned terminal as "maze of intentions" with hidden transformative potential offers fresh angle on ruins-to-renewal. The sextant as architectural key is inventive. The story commits to its premise of seeing potential where others see scrap. Some elements feel slightly convenient (carnival's capacitors perfectly suited for reactivation), but the synthesis largely feels earned.</comment>
