I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages from Isla's dilemma through Kael's coded message to her engineering solution.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Isla's internal conflict between preservation and progress drives credible choices, with her machinist expertise enabling the resolution. The moment where she discovers Kael's hidden compass rose reveals layered characterization through their shared history. Minor deduction for Kael remaining somewhat functional despite political complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from dilemma through discovery to synthesis solution, with clear closure showing Isla implementing her bypass design. The cost is visible in her relief and the risk she took defying the Council's direct order. The orientations (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Singing Mountain's breathing rhythm constrains timing and creates atmospheric pressure throughout. The surveyor's chain serves dual purpose as measurement tool and thematic object about finding balance. Setting actively shapes the solution through unused thermal vents.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from political pressure through Kael's ultimatum to Isla's realization about structural instability. The tightening occurs when she must choose between compliance and finding a third way, with clear cost in defying the Council. Agency drives the resolution through her engineering insight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of harmonizing opposing values emerges through action rather than statement, with the surveyor's chain embodying the search for balance. The compass rose code adds layers about hidden compassion within duty. Final image of the mountain breathing "in harmony once more" resonates without moralizing, though slightly neat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical precision filtered through Isla's expertise ("calloused thumb," "calibrated分流 channels"). Narrative distance remains stable in close third. Minor inconsistency with the Chinese character "分流" appearing unexplained in otherwise English prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum. Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece well. Deductions for the unexplained Chinese character, slight overwriting in places ("perpetual gloom," "dormant volcano whose heart beat"), and one instance of telling emotion directly ("slyly heartfelt").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The breathing mountain as timer and the hidden message beneath official seal show creative problem-solving. The third-option engineering solution feels earned through Isla's expertise. Somewhat familiar "caught between two factions" setup elevated by specific technical details.</comment>
