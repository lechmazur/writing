<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—salvaging, building, preserving—with the censer foot serving as a tactile anchor for memory. The internal conflict between loss and preservation drives meaningful micro-choices, particularly in incorporating the personal artifact into the technical solution. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "geography of loss" that occasionally drifts toward therapy-speak, though it's mostly grounded in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the charged final image of Elara waiting in darkness, having transformed the station into a "tomb" but achieving "profound peace." The closure lands as Earned Stasis—she accepts her fate while preserving humanity's essence, with clear cost (her life). The orientation anchors (orbital station, dying systems, Elara alone) establish cleanly within the first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dying station functions as both setting and constraint, forcing Elara's improvised solution. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"ghostly blue glow," "grated floor," "starlit signal station mode"—filtered through technical necessity. The censer foot's patina surface as "a map of verdigris continents" provides vivid specificity that ties object to world-loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds from station failure to the final transmission, with each step narrowing options: hydraulics gone, static position, accelerated schedule, last power reserves. The dominant stake—preserving humanity's essence before death—intensifies through resource depletion. Cost is unmistakable: Elara's life traded for the archive's survival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of preservation-as-resistance, with the censer foot bridging personal and collective memory. The final image of waiting in darkness after successful transmission offers a non-literal answer about legacy transcending individual survival. The "reverse migration" concept deepens from physical to metaphysical without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains technical competence mixed with poetic observation ("stars were impossibly sharp," "verdigris continents"). The brief dialogue is appropriately terse and functional. Some register elevation in emotional peaks ("monument to a dying dream") fits the elegiac tone though occasionally brushes against purple prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong momentum, though "geography of loss" appears twice and some figurative language clusters densely ("bleeding atmosphere," "ghostly blue glow," "hydraulic heart"). Information density is high—most sentences advance both plot and atmosphere. The final image lands with appropriate weight despite minor redundancy in describing the station as both "tomb" and death-related imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of technical survival narrative with memory preservation offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic fiction. The censer foot as both personal artifact and technical component shows ingenuity. The "reverse migration" to the Oort Cloud sanctuary provides specificity beyond generic "save humanity's culture" templates.</comment>
