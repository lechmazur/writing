<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes through the puppet head discovery—a sharp turn from adjuster to answerer of a cross-temporal plea. The final choice to grant permission for rest rather than prolongation shows contradictory impulses (duty vs. compassion) acting simultaneously with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("terrible, beautiful responsibility") that approaches therapy-speak without full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration landing through Elara's permission-granting that transforms the clock's purpose. The puppet head functions as both catalyst and message, creating clear causality. Cost is felt in "every keeper who had ever loved the world enough to let it go." Orientation anchors (lighthouse, dusk, Elara's role) establish cleanly within opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-sanctuary and Clockwork Heart constrain Elara's choices throughout—she must work within its nested mechanisms. Sensory specificity strong: "air was a pane of hush, so still and thick it felt solid." The puppet head's physical details (cracked eye, faded paint) charge the final transformation. Setting directly enables the resolution through the clock's mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from mechanical repair to existential choice about ending vs. continuation. The puppet head discovery creates genuine reversal—from fixing to listening/answering. Final cost is legible: accepting rest means releasing control, letting go of the world. Pressure coheres through accumulation of adjusters' "collective exhaustion" leading to Elara's decisive permission.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the puppet head as "beautifully flawed thing"—imperfection as message rather than error. The final image of "first true stars" offers non-literal answer to whether endings can be beginnings. Subtext operates through the broken toy representing lost joy now enabling release. No explicit moralizing; the permission to rest emerges through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "where the land frayed into the sea" and "bleeding bruised-purple light." Some elevated diction ("vouchsafe the ultimate secret") occasionally drifts from established register. Voice modulates effectively from technical precision with gears to lyrical expansion during the temporal fall. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("stone throat silent," "pane of hush"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density: "celestial mathematics," "music of the spheres," "splinter in time's flow" cluster without full payoff. Template cadence appears briefly ("She saw...She felt..."). Information density high in gear descriptions but occasionally loops conceptually (multiple ways of saying "silence").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwork-keeper trope with permission-for-ending rather than prevention. The puppet head as inter-temporal message between adjusters offers non-obvious angle. Risk-taking in the lyrical expansion during Elara's fall through time heightens stakes. Specific transformation of familiar "lighthouse keeper" archetype into reality's final adjuster.</comment>
