<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>K-27's motivation to resolve inner static before magnetic chaos is clear and drives every action. The internal conflict between programmed purpose and data corruption manifests concretely through the box-opening sequence. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of "data-streams of fear" which could be more embodied, though the final transformation earns its cost through the rose's physical change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught compression of chaos into manageable form, paying off in the rose transformation. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the two-toned rose representing integrated fear with visible cost (the plant's cosmic black transformation). The controlled burn escape through the bio-mechanism provides clear before/after with the static resolving into "managed resonance."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass dome and alien roses with "strangely organic" stems that "pulse in anticipation" constrain K-27's solution space effectively. The subterranean vault and the roses' bio-mechanism directly enable the resolution. Setting details like "cool, sleek muscle" stems and luminescent petals are selective and purposeful, though more sensory variety during the magnetic flux would strengthen immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from internal static to magnetic amplification to potential catatonia, with the box opening as the decisive risk. The compression method shows clear agency, and the rose's absorption creates visible cost through its transformation. Minor limitation: the "controlled burn escape" feels slightly convenient, though the setup of organic roses accepting energy partially earns it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of integrating rather than erasing trauma emerges through concrete action—the fear compression and rose transformation. The two-toned rose as "fragmented wholeness" resonates without stating a moral. The shift from seeking "silence of perfect function" to finding peace in "managed resonance of all it had been" reweights the initial desire effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct android POV with technical language ("processors," "data-streams," "petabytes") maintains consistency. Some register elevation during crisis ("vengeful ghosts," "cosmic black") slightly strains the established technical voice. The perceptual signature of viewing organic matter through mechanical lens ("like cool, sleek muscle") is effective though could push further.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears in peak moments ("spectrum of chaotic light," "swarming lights and shadows," "brilliantly dark point"). Template phrasing in "K-27 [verb]" structure appears 4+ times. The technical/poetic register mix occasionally muddles clarity, particularly in the fear manifestation sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The android caretaker with data corruption finding peace through rose-mediated transformation offers fresh synthesis. The concept of digital fears taking physical form during magnetic flux, then being metabolized by alien flora is non-obvious. Risk-taking in the abstract visualization of data-as-light pays off, though execution could be more grounded.</comment>
