<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's internal transformation from controlling scientist to receptive observer is earned through concrete embodied moments—his frown, sitting on the stool, watching vines tremble with anticipation. The final choice to redesign for resilience rather than efficiency carries visible cost (abandoning three years of methodology). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in the middle ("reluctant metamorphosis begin") that briefly pulls from embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Aris shifts from control to witness, with the linden leaf serving as catalyst and final memorial. The cost is palpable—three years of failed methodology abandoned, data tablet dark. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the storm's sensory pressure building toward stance crystallization. Slight deduction for predictable arc that follows expected beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory grounding through rain percussion, ozone scent, storm-light, and the greenhouse's humid transformation. The linden leaf's journey and placement constrain Aris's final choice. Deduction for some generic weather descriptions ("dark bruise against the grey sky") and the setting doesn't quite reach the constraint level needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from failed algorithms through environmental surrender to complete methodological abandonment. The storm's return creates natural pressure that forces Aris's choice. Cost is clear in abandoning control and three years of work. Missing the sharper tension that would push into higher bands—the transformation feels somewhat predetermined.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between control and witness, with the linden leaf as perfect objective correlative for unpredictable beauty. The final image of the preserved leaf reweights the entire narrative without stating a moral. Minor deduction for slightly over-explicit thematic phrasing ("growth was not a problem to be solved, but a process to be joined").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with scientific precision shifting to more receptive language as Aris transforms. Some elegant phrasing ("circuitously sincere in its journey"). Deductions for occasional register drift into overly writerly territory ("reluctant metamorphosis," "felt experience") and some filter-verb clustering that dulls immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Notable issues: template cadence in observation sequences ("He observed... He saw... He watched"), some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete, and occasional overwriting ("perpetually on the cusp of becoming"). The scaffolding phrases limit momentum in key transformation beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse-as-laboratory setting and scientist-observer transformation offer a familiar framework executed competently. The linden leaf as random catalyst provides modest freshness. However, the arc from control to surrender follows predictable beats without surprising turns or unique emotional textures that would distinguish it from similar transformation narratives.</comment>
