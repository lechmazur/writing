I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story operates through clear because/therefore linkages (blackout causes hive failure, riddle leads to discovery, choice determines outcome).

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arawn's involuntary truthfulness creates genuine character specificity, and his final choice between city lights and food shows clear value hierarchy with visible cost. The fear of opening the box effectively mirrors his larger choice. Minor deduction for the grandfather's convenient riddle placement feeling slightly mechanical.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from blackout to hive failure to forced choice, with clear Decisive Change when Arawn chooses life over function. The empty honey-scented box provides resonant closure with felt cost. Slight deduction for the riddle's convenience, though it pays off thematically.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tower's iron skeleton and "nectar dusk" sky create vivid atmosphere, and the grounding plate location constrains the final choice effectively. The vertical farms and drone hives build a believable tech-organic world. Loses points for not fully exploiting the tower's verticality in the action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The city lights versus food dilemma creates genuine stakes with clear trade-offs. Escalation works through discovery (riddle → battery → forced choice) with visible cost when Arawn sacrifices the city's immediate power needs. The single lantern image effectively captures the price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The preservation of wonder theme emerges organically through the lacquer box parallel and culminates in choosing life/pollination over mere function. The empty box's honey scent brilliantly reweights the entire premise without stating a moral. Strong thematic coherence throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third with Arawn's diagnostic mindset coloring perception ("His mind, sharpened by years of diagnostic routine"). The involuntary truth-telling creates unique voice moments. Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("nectar dusk") slightly strains POV credibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. "The city was dark, a silent expanse beneath a sky the color of spilled honey and wine" sets strong tone. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("crushing routine of daily life") and some predictable phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The involuntary truth-telling condition offers fresh characterization, and linking municipal infrastructure to bee pollination shows creative world-building. The grandfather's riddle feels somewhat convenient, and the choice structure follows familiar patterns despite specific details.</comment>
