I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds pressure through density increase and pattern accumulation (gravity pockets, silence, memory objects) toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to recover deleted memories is embodied through concrete actions (coffee ground divination, descending into the mine) with physical cost (gravity pockets pinning her). The final choice to leave most memories in place shows mature restraint, though the emotional specificity of the lost memory ("a laugh on a summer pier") edges toward generic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as Elara recovers one memory but leaves others, accepting incomplete restoration. The accumulative pattern (gravity pockets → coffee grounds → crystal chamber → memory flood) coheres well, though the connection between whale death and memory release feels slightly arbitrary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber functions as micro-setting that constrains choice through its "cathedral of crystal" architecture and the physical excavation required. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("sharp and ancient" air, "translucent giants"), and the environment directly shapes the final discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative density: gravity pockets intensify, coffee grounds reveal urgency, physical excavation demands hours of labor. The cost is legible in Elara's "agonizing minute" pinned to rock and the final acceptance of partial recovery, though middle pressure could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the physical metaphor of memories as tangible objects that can be excavated but not all reclaimed. The final image of leaving memories "in that sacred tomb" offers a non-literal answer about grief and acceptance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent perceptual signature through Elara's specific way of noticing ("hollow rhythm," "bleeding light"). Some register elevation appears ("cathedral of crystal," "weightless ballet") but stays within bounds for a keeper of harbor lights with poetic sensibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythm variation and information density, particularly in the discovery sequence. Minor scaffold appears in "She understood her task. She had to exhume" (paraphrase loop) and some filter verb clustering ("she felt," "she believed"), preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of physical gravity distortions with emotional weight of lost memories offers a fresh angle. The coffee ground divination method and salt crystal chamber as memory repository show specific imagination, though the beached whale catalyst feels somewhat convenient.</comment>
