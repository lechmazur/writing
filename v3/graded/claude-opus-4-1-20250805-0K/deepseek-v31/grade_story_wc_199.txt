Looking at this story through the lens of a demanding editor, I'll evaluate it with the Accumulative/Textural drive lens, as the piece builds through density and pattern toward its transformative closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aisling's motivation to decode the falling leaves provides clear, consistent drive throughout, and her transformation from sorter to living librarian carries genuine cost—the loss of her former self. The internal contradiction between methodical duty and secret yearning creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the transformation's embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Decisive Change when Aisling becomes the Arbor's translator, with the cost being her fundamental transformation of being. The accumulative pattern—from sorting seeds to building monuments to achieving communion—builds coherently toward this reconfiguration. The "emerges transformed always" line makes the irreversibility explicit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Ashen skyborne arbor functions as more than setting—it's a sentient entity whose physical details (grey seeds, falling leaves, ancient branches) constrain and enable Aisling's choices. The moonstone dust's placement "within a fissure of a particularly ancient branch" makes discovery feel earned. The environment literally charges the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative density: sorting leads to discovery, discovery to monument-building, monuments to transformation. The cost is legible when Aisling "became their story"—losing individual identity to gain universal knowledge. The stakes deepen from personal curiosity to existential change.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between preservation and revelation, with the moonstone dust representing forgotten histories deserving remembrance. The final revelation that the Arbor is a library reweights every prior detail without stating a moral. The "mossy delight" that bookends the piece gains resonance as both human and arboreal joy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation appropriate to the mythic register, with selective perception focused on botanical and temporal details. Some filter phrases ("she felt the knowledge") slightly dull immediacy during the climactic transformation. The perceptual signature—attending to minute botanical details while missing the larger pattern—effectively characterizes Aisling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the hush where past meets prophecy") but suffers from occasional redundancy ("vast, silent tree" could lose an adjective). Some filter constructions during the transformation sequence ("She felt the knowledge not as words") reduce immediacy. Information density is generally high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a tree-as-library with falling leaves as published pages offers genuine freshness, transforming the archetypal world-tree. The specific synthesis of seed-sorting, monument-building, and linguistic revelation feels earned rather than arbitrary. The piece commits fully to its lyrical mode without hedging toward conventional plot mechanics.</comment>
