I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered description and metaphor toward Arthur's cathartic moment, with density increase and pattern accumulation rather than causal turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment of Arthur's emotional state through the weaving. The transformation moment lands with genuine emotional weight. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "texture of connection" that edges toward therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Arthur experiences profound reconnection with visible emotional cost (weeping). The accumulative structure coheres well through the weaving metaphor. Slight opacity in how "memories alter" functions as timeframe rather than clear temporal anchor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The gallery setting actively shapes the work - impossible angles and visual tricks become structural elements of Elara's creation. Vivid sensory detail of the sinew thread's "prismatic glimmers" and the gallery's "unsettling calm." The environment constrains and enables the central artistic act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear - creating connection through "rational enchantment" - with steady accumulation toward the cathartic release. The tension builds through description rather than conflict, appropriate for the textural lens. Cost is visible in Arthur's overwhelming emotional response, though the piece lacks intermediate pressure points.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "rational enchantment" - using logic to access emotion. The final image of Arthur rediscovering "tangible texture" of love resonates without stating a moral. Slight deduction for abstractness in "texture of connection" metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled, architectural precision matching Elara's profession. Strong perceptual signature in how she sees the gallery's illusions. Vocabulary elevated but appropriate to an architect-artist. Clean psychic distance maintained throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("febrile hallucinations," "rational enchantment," "realistically imaginary") that occasionally obscures clarity. Template cadence in "She recalled... his fear... his longing" sequence. Information density high but sometimes tips into purple territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of architecture and emotion through "Fever Dream Architect" concept. The premise of engineering subconscious experiences with "precise logic of a physicist" offers genuine originality. Risk-taking in the conceptual approach pays off with coherent execution (+0.3 within band).</comment>
