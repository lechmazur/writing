<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Veridian's transformation from certainty to nuanced understanding drives authentic change with visible cost—his dissolution into conscious sand. The revelation that his purpose was a lie creates genuine internal conflict acted out through concrete action (striking the ampoule). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "nuance" and "certainty" that edges toward conceptual language rather than embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (revelation, telepathic contact, liberation) building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Veridian's dissolution transforms the prison into living garden. Cost is unmistakable—protagonist literally dissolves to free the creator. The orientation anchors (underwater city garden, statue guardian) establish clearly by ~60 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The underwater garden setting directly constrains choices through the dome's fissure (enabling telepathic contact) and the hidden niche in the plinth. Vivid sensory detail ("luminescent anemone fronds that pulsed with stolen, dying light") filtered through Veridian's stone consciousness. The setting transformation at closure—garden finally alive with its own light—charges the final image powerfully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from maintaining stasis to freeing the imprisoned creator, with each revelation tightening options—from telepathic scream to external contact to the ampoule discovery. The cost (Veridian's dissolution) is earned through his agency in striking the ampoule despite knowing it will break him. One meaningful deepening through cascading revelations that reweight his purpose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of certainty into nuanced understanding, with the final image of Veridian's grains "threading their way through the broken dome towards the open sea" offering resonant answer without stating moral. The creator imprisoned for "boundless, unpredictable imagination" deepens thematic complexity about freedom versus control.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of stone consciousness ("slow, grinding thoughts") with controlled psychic distance throughout. Purposeful compression and elevated diction serve the mythic tone. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("grotesque parody of life in the animate lifelessness") that slightly exceeds the established voice pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptions like "foxglove-stained glass ampoule, shaped like a closing blossom." Some elevated diction in peak beats ("cascading revelation unraveling the prison's magic") creates minor opacity. Template phrase "felt like another age" and abstract phrasing around "nuance" and "certainty" create slight momentum drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of guardian-statue-gains-consciousness with underwater prison concept, transformed through specific detail (telepathic garden, creator imprisoned for imagination). The revelation structure inverts expectations—guardian becomes liberator, prison becomes artwork. Risk-taking in the dissolution ending heightens stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
