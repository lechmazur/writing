I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Inferred: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered discoveries and symbolic resonance rather than strict causality, culminating in a conceptual repricing of the chess game metaphor.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "discover the shape of intentions" drives concrete action through tapestry decoding and locket discovery, with embodied tension in "fingers tracing knotted silks." The transformation from "blithe" to "settled with newfound gravity" shows earned change through specific experience, though internal contradiction could be sharper during the decoding sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where the chess piece revelation reweights the opening game and "shape of intentions" through the gambit metaphor. The accumulative structure coheres through chess→tapestry→locket→king progression with clear cost in "profound love and loss." Minor orientation delay (cemetery location emerges gradually) doesn't harm closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt silo setting constrains and enables discovery through its "capsule of chilled air" containing the chest, while starlight provides the only illumination for work. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"velveteen gloom," "cold concrete floor," "metallic taste of anticipation"—with the silo's walls becoming active through "uncharted echoes" that charge the final revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity to uncovering "a gambit, a move of profound love and loss" through the tapestry decoding, with tension in matching "hues to symbols" and the pressure of "sensations" rising from walls. The dominant stake of discovering intentions tightens through each revelation, though more resistance during decoding would strengthen agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the chess gambit metaphor—"hidden the king to save the game"—which retroactively charges the opening game and "shape of intentions" without stating a moral. The resonant answer to intention-discovery arrives through concrete discovery rather than assertion, with the locket's "celestial map" adding cosmic scope to human loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevation—"velveteen gloom," "resonant tick"—that modulates appropriately from contemplative to urgent during the sensory surge. POV remains cleanly limited third with consistent psychic distance, though slight register elevation in "desperate story into the present" briefly strains the established texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "stars were sharp and cold" and purposeful rhythm variation. Some overwriting appears in the sensory surge sequence ("ghost of a hand...breath on her neck...metallic taste") and mild redundancy in "finally concluded" after establishing completion. Information density is moderate; several sentences could carry more weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess strategy with archaeological discovery through the "gambit" revelation that reframes both games. The tapestry-as-puzzle and sovereign case with hidden compartment show specific invention, though the ghost-echo device trends toward familiar territory. The ending's "strategic sacrifice" transforms the chess metaphor meaningfully.</comment>
