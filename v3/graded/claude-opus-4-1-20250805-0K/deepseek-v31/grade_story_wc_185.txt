<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelyn's motivation is clear and deepens through embodied action—her fingers reading stone, her will flowing as "suggestion" not force. The contradiction between her role as passive mapkeeper and active healer creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "gardener tending to a frightened thing" metaphor that briefly distances us from her concrete experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the violent energy transforms into "bloom of hush" with visible cost (Kaelyn "sank to her knees, breathless"). The ice-crack patterns as sonic pathways provides excellent causal linkage. Slight deduction because the energy beings' departure happens off-page, weakening the before/after contrast.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The harmonic caves function as both setting and instrument—walls with "familiar striations," the echo chamber stone that captures and releases sound. The ice-crack patterns constrain Kaelyn's method beautifully. Deduction for some abstract descriptions ("hammered repose," "metallic stillness") that don't fully ground us spatially.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from finding quiet to actively transforming chaos through the stone's "terrified heart" pulsing. The cost is legible when Kaelyn exhausts herself channeling the energy. However, the actual conflict with the energy beings happened before the story begins, limiting present-tense pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of violence into peace—"the quiet she had sought was not the absence of the storm, but the shape of its aftermath." The ice-cracks as both literal tool and metaphor for subdivision/healing resonates without forcing. Minor deduction for the slightly over-explicit final realization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through tactile focus—Kaelyn "listens with her fingertips," sees through touch. The prose modulates from tense precision during the transformation to expansive calm afterward. Some register elevation ("underground firmament") slightly strains the mapkeeper's voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though "hammered repose" and "metallic stillness" feel forced. Template cadence appears briefly ("She knew...She placed...She closed"). The transformation sequence maintains strong momentum but some abstract phrasing ("presence disrupting the ancient song") reduces immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sound-as-substance with geological mapping creates an original magic system. The concept of teaching stone to "release silence" rather than simply quieting it shows genuine ingenuity. Transformation of destruction into healing through ice-pattern methodology feels earned, though energy beings remain generic.</comment>
