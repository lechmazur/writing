I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant with Causal elements). The story builds through textural accumulation of Elara's condition and quest, with causal linkage in the stone's discovery sequence.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through her mercury-glass eyes and nightly visions that "substituted reality with this brutal, clarifying sight." The final choice to become "a reader" rather than "a passive victim" shows earned agency with visible cost—she must endure brutal truths nightly. Internal contradiction operates throughout as she seeks home while her visions destroy the concept.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara transforms from victim to reader of reality's "brutal, beautiful architecture." The feather's texture causally guides her to the stone, which provides "grammar to read" her visions. Cost is explicit: she must endure nightly brutal truths, now reframed as "the sound of the world's heart."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore with "endless flights of stairs and corridors choked with shelves" constrains Elara's search, requiring tactile navigation via feather texture. The cavernous room with book stalagmites provides specific, memorable imagery. Setting directly enables the quest's resolution through its labyrinthine nature.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking understanding to actively navigating by touch alone: "She did not look with her mercury-glass eyes. She ran the feather over her palm." The cost crystallizes when finding the stone doesn't eliminate visions but transforms them into "a quiet, foundational hum"—a reweighting rather than escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of "home" from a lost concept to "this profound, difficult, and honest foundation." The stone doesn't cure but translates, making brutal truth bearable. The final image of pressing feather to stone creates a ritual that seeds "newfound peace into the coming night."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through "mercury-glass eyes" and synesthetic descriptions like "hidden thunder of her existence." Voice modulates from lyrical description to concrete action during the search sequence. Some elevated diction ("parse the noise") fits the bookstore setting and Elara's quest.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though some abstract phrasing ("the fabric of her perception," "systematic ripped away") could be more concrete. Strong specific images like "books stacked into great, precarious stalagmites" balance occasional overwriting. The final paragraph contains slight redundancy in explaining the transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seer-curse with tactile navigation creates an unexpected solution—using texture to find truth's grammar. The concept of visions that show "unvarnished reality" rather than future is distinctive. The stone as translator rather than cure subverts expected resolution patterns.</comment>
