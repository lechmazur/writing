I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This story operates under a **Hybrid** lens, beginning with Accumulative/Textural elements (the listening, the sensory details of exploration) but shifting to Causal at closure when Elara makes the decisive choice to share the testimony. I'll judge closure under the Causal lens as dominant at the end.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "discover what walls dream about" creates a distinctive character with clear interiority, and her final choice to bear witness shows earned agency. The sensitivity to vibrations enables key discoveries. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("weight of his legacy's burden") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from discovery to testimony, with the film negative triggering revelation and forcing Elara's choice to share the burden. The Decisive Change lands with clear cost—Elara transforms from solitary listener to public witness. Orientation anchors effectively by paragraph two. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract cost articulation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled manor and its "hungry forest" create atmospheric pressure, with sensory details (damp earth, decay) grounding the exploration. The wall itself becomes micro-setting that constrains discovery. Deduction for some generic descriptors ("thick with scent") and missed opportunity to make the physical space more actively shape choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from academic curiosity to moral imperative as Elara discovers the truth, with the wall's "scream" forcing her confrontation with complicity. The burden transforms from personal to collective through her agency. Cost is visible in her choice to carry testimony. Minor deduction for somewhat predictable escalation pattern.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery—walls don't dream of peace but of "moments that shaped them." The final transformation of cartography into testimony offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The negative frames and daughter's diary create layered meaning about witnessing and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled diction ("corridor echo cartographer," "ivy-veiled passage") that maintains consistency. POV stays firmly with Elara throughout. Some elevated register moments ("wilful ignorance for profit") slightly strain the established voice. Clean psychic distance management.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Information density is solid. Deductions for abstract phrases like "weight of his legacy's burden" and "collective memory to guard against," plus some filter-verb reliance ("She understood then," "She felt"). The "terrible dream" metaphor at closure muddles slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of walls holding memory offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic discovery. The specific profession of "corridor echo cartographer" is inventive. However, the climate change revelation and generational guilt follow familiar patterns without significant transformation. The execution is competent but doesn't risk bold structural choices.</comment>
