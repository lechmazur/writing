I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric precisely.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern (the opal dock appearances, the investigation method of "observing gaps") toward a resonant reconfiguration where Emil's gesture is recontextualized from despair to navigation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation crystallizes through embodied details ("borrowed memories," "second skin") and his investigative method reveals character through action. The woman's arrival and grief feel authentic, though Emil remains more concept than person. The final exchange earns its emotional weight through accumulated particulars rather than declaration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the Edelweiss transforms from mystery to lighthouse, reweighting Emil's death from despair to devotion with clear emotional cost ("his mind failing, stealing the music from him note by note"). The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward revelation. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay with the woman's appearance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal dock's "milky, internal light" and recurring materialization creates atmospheric pressure that frames each twilight descent. "Thin soil above the shore" and maritime/alpine contrast work well. Setting constrains investigation to twilight encounters, though the dock could more actively shape choices beyond serving as meeting ground.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: physical evidence yields to "borrowed memories," then the woman's arrival forces resolution. The gap between "devotion, courage" and "despair of a suicide" creates productive tension. Cost registers in Emil's deterioration and the woman's grief, though Silas's personal stakes could deepen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the investigation of "gaps"—what's absent revealing more than what's present. The Edelweiss as "lighthouse" for memory resonates without stating its moral. "A story of love that was, at last, complete" risks slight tidiness but earns its closure through prior complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through phrases like "curator of absence" and "maritime gloom." POV control strong with Silas's limited knowledge maintained until revelation. The woman's dialogue feels natural ("His name was Emil") and carries appropriate subtext. Slight register elevation in places but serves the elegiac tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clean, literary prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression ("salt-stained suit, cold and still"). Information density high throughout. Minor redundancy in "softly persistent" appearing twice, and occasional elevated diction ("maritime gloom," "nautical twilight") that slightly distances, though pattern feels intentional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The investigation-through-absence method offers fresh angle on mystery structure. Edelweiss as memory-anchor for deteriorating composer is specific and moving. The lighthouse keeper as witness rather than actor subverts expectations effectively, though the resolution's emotional beats follow somewhat familiar patterns.</comment>
