<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's quiet rebellion manifests through embodied micro-choices (deliberate slowness, jaw tension, defiant drumming rhythms) that build to the climactic synchronized drumming. The contradictory impulses—compliance versus defiance, accepting treatment versus preserving memory—act simultaneously throughout, culminating in a costly choice to risk everything for connection. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("auroral sorrow," "beautiful, aching melancholy") that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through drumming patterns until reality warps, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where connection is achieved but immediately lost. The cost is visceral—gaining then losing physical touch with Kael—and the final "quiet rhythm in her pulse" shows permanent change. Who/where/when anchored early (Serenity Center, Sound Wave Garden, Subject Seven).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Sound Wave Garden functions as more than setting—its crystal spire becomes the instrument of rebellion, floating orbs respond to drumming, and the moss provides tactile resistance. The auric lagoon overlay creates a dual-reality that constrains the final moment (hands passing through, then solidifying briefly). Setting actively shapes choices and charges the closure when "the gardens reasserted themselves."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative drumming intensity: prescribed rhythms → complex staccato beat → reality warping → synchronized defiance across distance. The dominant stake (preserving authentic memory versus accepting treatment) tightens when Elara discovers the true purpose of treatment is severing her bond. Cost is legible when physical connection is gained then immediately lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between institutional control and authentic memory/love without explicit moralizing. The recurring auric lagoon transforms from "phantom symptom" to revealed truth to lost-but-felt connection, offering a resonant answer about what endures despite forced separation. The final "entanglement held" reweights all prior drumming as communication rather than mere rebellion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's focus on rhythm, resonance, and tactile sensation ("pulsed with soft, sympathetic light," "ached in her hands"). Voice maintains consistency through stress with purposeful compression during the reality-warp sequence. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("hush of the universe inhaling") that slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied syntax, but several instances of abstract emotional labeling dilute immediacy ("auroral sorrow," "beautiful, aching melancholy"). Some figurative density in non-peak moments ("universe inhaling," "cosmic breaths") without full payoff. Information density is high and no significant loops detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-as-rebellion and synchronized resistance across distance elevates familiar institutional control premise. The specific mechanism (sonic therapy to sever psychic bonds) and the dual-reality overlay during climax show genuine ingenuity. Risk-taking in the lyrical opening and reality-warp sequence heightens stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
