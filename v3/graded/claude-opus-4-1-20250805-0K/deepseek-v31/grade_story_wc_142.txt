I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant with Causal elements). The story accumulates pressure through Rio's graffiti campaign and builds to a resonant reconfiguration where she bridges old and new rather than resisting change.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rio's "orderly intuitive" nature manifests concretely through her graffiti encoding system, and her dual allegiance creates genuine internal tension. The net-mender's response demonstrates earned character impact, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("potent, humming mix of hopeful desperation").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—Rio shifts from resistance to navigation, with the net-mender's proposal crystallizing this pivot. The foundation stone chip anchors past/future tension effectively. Cost is implied through "cold undercurrent" but could be more visceral at the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The raft city setting directly constrains choices—privatization threatens physical space, graffiti walls provide canvas for resistance. "Perpetual carnival" atmosphere permeates sensory detail. The foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting that charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from private rebellion (graffiti) to community awakening (net-mender's response) to potential systemic change. The shift from "wall to keep change out" to "channel to guide it" marks meaningful deepening, though physical cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the foundation stone's dual meaning and Rio's bridge role. The graffiti maze metaphor—pathways forming the stone's shape—elegantly embodies navigation versus resistance. Final image of dancing on new currents while remembering old rhythms resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent texture with phrases like "culture shock absorber" and "floating borough." POV filters setting through Rio's specific lens. Some register elevation in peak moments ("defiant, joyous sound against the vast, darkening sea") slightly exceeds established diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves solid momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor template cadence in "She had seen... They were remembering..." sequence and slight overwriting in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of coded graffiti as community organizing tool offers fresh angle on gentrification narrative. Rio's dual committee/rebel role avoids simple binaries. The synthesis of "both... for us and for them" transforms expected resistance narrative into navigation story.</comment>
