<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's protective instinct surge and his shift from passive observer to active defender represents genuine character movement with embodied fear ("blood rushing in his ears"). The internal contradiction between his practical nature and supernatural encounter drives authentic tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract "ancient grief" and limited exploration of his relationship with Elara beyond the letters.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Elias's cairn-building transforms from defensive gesture to connective act, with visible cost in facing supernatural threat. The letters discovery midpoint effectively reweights the haunting from pure menace to threat against human connection. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the ghostly presence's retreat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse lantern room functions as active constraint, with the rotation mechanism hiding the letters and iron grating vibrating with supernatural presence. The cairn of tools brilliantly repurposes the setting's industrial elements into protective geometry. Sea glass serves as grounding talisman throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds from equipment failure to supernatural encounter to protective stance, with the letters raising stakes from personal safety to preserving connection. The temperature drop and door's violent opening effectively tighten pressure. Cost is visible in Elias's defensive stand against "ancient grief," though the resolution's ease slightly undermines full tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stone-stacking motif elegantly bridges physical and emotional communication, paying off when Elias builds his tool cairn as both message and barricade. Theme of human connection as defense against isolation emerges organically from the letter exchange and supernatural confrontation. The "luminescent ache" perfectly captures the story's emotional register.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice modulates effectively from technical observation ("failing fuel pump") to lyrical intensity ("whispers grew teeth"). POV maintains appropriate constraint with Elias's limited knowledge of Elara. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("ancient grief seeking an entry point") that slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong sensory grounding and propulsive syntax, particularly in "The lamp flickered once, twice, and died." Some figurative density in supernatural descriptions ("darkness here had weight and intention") and minor template phrasing ("His heart thudded against his ribs"). The cairn-building sequence achieves excellent clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain between isolated lighthouse inhabitants offers fresh take on epistolary connection. The transformation of construction tools into protective cairn shows inventive use of available materials. The ghost-as-grief concept, while executed well, follows familiar patterns.</comment>
