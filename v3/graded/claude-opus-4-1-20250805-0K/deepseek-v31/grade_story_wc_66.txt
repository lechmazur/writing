<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes beautifully from vague longing to "terrifying beauty" when she decides to teach dust to tell stories, with embodied tension ("heart thumping a strange rhythm"). The final choice to broadcast stories carries visible cost—she risks treason—though internal contradiction could be sharper during the discovery sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara transforms from passive receiver to active transmitter, with the dust learning to tell stories as proof of change. The cost is legible—she commits treason nightly, risking capture. The accumulative lens holds as lyrical clues build toward the discovery and teaching sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ember alcove's "green glow" and conservatory's "mist-wreathed heart" constrain choices—she must search specific locations following cryptic clues. The radio's warmth and the dust's luminous quality when touched by light create tactile specificity that shapes her experimental method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from passive listening to active searching to treasonous broadcasting, each step narrowing options. The dust's first story ("a leaf unfurling toward the sun") marks the decisive turn, though middle pressure could tighten further between discovery and success.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The final image of Elara broadcasting from her "ember alcove wreathed in the mist of her own breath" reweights the opening's silence as fertile rather than barren. The dust that "learns, and remembers, and tells" offers a non-literal answer to cultural starvation through patient nurturing rather than force.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature: Elara processes the world through musical precision ("etching the maestro's notations") and sound ("low hum against a faint cello's drone"). Voice maintains lyrical control even under pressure, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("terrifying beauty," "luminous with hope").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("ember alcove," "thistled calm"), but several template phrases weaken impact: "moved through the muted world," "heart thumping a strange rhythm," "sob caught in throat." The extended metaphorical ending ("seeds," "revolution," "fertile") accumulates without adding new pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Teaching dust to tell stories through sound rather than language offers a fresh angle on creation myths. The specific synthesis of musical copyist skills with pirate broadcasting feels earned, though the concept of "story famine" remains somewhat generic without deeper world-building.</comment>
