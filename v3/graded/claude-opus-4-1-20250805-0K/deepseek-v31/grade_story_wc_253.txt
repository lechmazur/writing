<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's grief-driven emptiness and protective impulse toward the dried flowers create genuine internal contradiction, embodied through whittling and narration rituals. The shift from cultivating "lightness in grief" to building "a vessel for it" represents earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("profound, weightless emptiness") that briefly weakens embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the lavender bloom's snap triggering a decisive shift from destructive whittling to protective creation of the floral bird. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the bird on the windowsill crystallizes Elias's transformed relationship to grief with clear emotional cost. The "remade hush" frames and pays off perfectly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The farmhouse's "dense and curated" silence and turbine shadows create atmospheric pressure that shapes Elias's actions. The dried bouquet constrains his final choice to protect rather than destroy. Setting details filter through his performer's eye, making the space feel lived-in and specific to his loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The flower stem's crack creates genuine escalation under the textural lens, forcing Elias from passive whittling to active protection. His "fierce and startling protectiveness" represents the first authentic feeling since the Mandate, with clear cost in abandoning his numbness. The transformation from carving away to weaving together deepens meaningfully.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The final bird image brilliantly reweights all prior material—"a thing both dead and full of potential flight" captures the story's central paradox without stating it. Theme emerges through concrete actions (whittling vs. weaving) and the turbine shadows' ambiguous blessing/sentence. The "silhouette within" the void offers resonant answer to grief's weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's flat performer's narration ("The performer selects his blade") creates distinctive voice that modulates when genuine feeling breaks through. The shift from third-person performance to first-person protection marks clear psychic distance control. POV filters everything through his blank-faced performer lens consistently.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong density with lines doing multiple jobs ("swept across the fields in a perpetual, silent eclipse"). Rhythm varies naturally between long atmospheric sentences and sharp moments ("A sudden, sharp crack made him start"). Minor deduction for one instance of abstract phrasing and slight repetition of "silence/silent" early on.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Happiness Mandate dystopia freshly explores enforced joy through intimate loss rather than typical rebellion narrative. Elias's performer background creates organic irony—paid to mime delight, now performing grief for himself. The floral bird as vessel for grief rather than escape from it offers non-obvious emotional truth.</comment>
