<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and consistent throughout, with his dedication to documenting overlooked histories driving every action. His internal experience of purpose shifting from loneliness to meaning in the butterfly vortex moment earns the closure. The character lacks deeper internal contradiction or embodied struggle under pressure, keeping this from the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Silas's act of knotting the moth wing transforms his temporary structures from guides into monuments, with visible cost in accepting impermanence. The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3. The closure lands with felt cost as he accepts his transient role as a "temporary knot in the fabric of time."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The verdant grotto setting constrains choices (limited materials for structures) and charges the final image through the "blushing stillness" that frames both disruption and return. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"papery whisper of countless orange wings," "soft rustle through dewy ferns." The micro-setting of the moth wing becomes essential to closure but doesn't quite reach 8+ due to some generic nature descriptors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring the last monarch migration—faces meaningful disruption when the hawk's violence introduces the moth wing, forcing Silas to expand his memorial's scope. The butterflies' unexpected vortex around the moth-adorned structure deepens the stake. Cost is visible but the escalation relies more on accumulation than active agency, fitting the textural lens but limiting the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the moth wing becoming a "monument to a specific life lost in the midst of the great migration," avoiding stated morals. The final image of Silas as a "temporary knot" connecting overlooked truths resonates without explanation. The piece earns its wisdom about impermanence and witness through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Silas's esoteric observer role—"transiently rooted," "verdant grotto," "blushing stillness." Perceptual signature shows in his ritualistic attention to small details. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("felt like held breath") without quite crossing into penalty territory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between stillness and disruption. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("a quiet so profound it felt respectful") and some template phrasing around "he had come to" constructions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of documenting a species' final migration while unexpectedly memorializing an individual moth offers a fresh angle on witness and memory. The synthesis of grand tragedy and small loss feels specific. The execution is competent but doesn't take significant risks that would elevate beyond solid craft.</comment>
