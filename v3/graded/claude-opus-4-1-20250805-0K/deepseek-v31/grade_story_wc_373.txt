I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through sensory density and pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration where trust's breaking becomes an internal sound rather than external capture.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—seeking revenge while still harboring "deep, foolish" trust—act simultaneously in the confrontation with Silas. The final renunciation of trust lands with visible cost in her "shuddering breath," though the revelation arrives slightly late for full causal build.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the recorder captures not external betrayal but Elara's internal fracture—"the silent, internal fracture she had just felt." Cost is unmistakable in the sigh that "escaped her own lips" and the transformation from burden to release, with the dawn dissolving the market as witness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The pirate market's "canvas and crates" and "rotting pier standing on skeletal legs" create lived-in specificity that constrains movement and time. Setting actively pressures through the sunrise deadline and the market's dissolution, though it could constrain middle choices more directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from searching through "false starts" to the confrontation where "comforting unease curdled into pure tension." The hand-grip becomes the decisive pressure point where history and betrayal collide, with clear cost in trust's audible breaking.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ending brilliantly reweights the premise: the "sound of trust breaking" isn't external confession but internal collapse—"It was the silent, internal fracture." This conceptual repricing transforms the entire quest from revenge-seeking to self-recognition without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "comforting unease that felt more like home" and selective attention to the market's "salt, decay, and spices." Some filter verbs ("she saw him") and occasional register elevation ("profound, weary sadness") slightly dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Generally clean propulsion with vivid specificity like "skeletal legs" and "bottled tempest." However, abstract phrasing clusters in peak moments ("profound, weary sadness," "last vestige of her belief") and some redundancy ("shared history and present betrayal") reduce density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The recorder that captures internal rather than external breaking is genuinely fresh—a non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The pirate market as "temporary city" and moonshine legacy create specific texture beyond template revenge plots.</comment>
