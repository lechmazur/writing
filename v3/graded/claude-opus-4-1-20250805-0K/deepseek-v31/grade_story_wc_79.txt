<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her cartographer identity, with her secret obsession driving meaningful choices. The descent into the fissure and decision to blow the whistle shows contradictory impulses (dread vs. purpose) acting in scene with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("sunwashed dread") rather than fully embodied states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkage from gate closure to resource crisis to crack opportunity to whistle use. Closure lands with Decisive Change (turtle turning) and visible cost (terror mixed with hope, city's fate altered). The persistent constraint of the closed gate shapes tactics throughout and charges the final image of the new heading.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices effectively—the crack provides access, the heart-chamber holds the key pattern, the city-turtles' migration defines survival. Who/where/when anchored early. The shell patterns function as both setting and tool, directly enabling the resolution. Some sensory details could be more selective under POV filter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (city's survival) signaled early and tightens through resource depletion to structural failure. The crack transforms from catastrophe to opportunity through Elara's agency. Escalation follows causal lens with the whistle action foreclosing the wandering path with visible cost—the city now committed to an unknown destination.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of reading/interpreting signs emerges through concrete events—the forgotten language of patterns, the misunderstood watchers. The final image offers resonant answer: salvation requires depth over distance, understanding over wandering. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "pattern languages" concept that could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third with appropriate lexicon for a cartographer. Perceptual signature shows in how Elara reads patterns and spirals. Some filter verb accumulation ("she saw," "she believed," "she knew") dulls immediacy in middle sections. Prose modulates effectively between description and action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density high in the heart-chamber sequence. Deductions for template cadence in middle exposition ("The Council...but Elara felt," "For years, Elara had studied") and some abstract phrasing ("sunwashed dread," "pervasive anxiety") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of turtle-cities with navigation crisis creates non-obvious angle. The concept that the turtle itself is the instrument shows genuine ingenuity. Pattern-reading as salvation method feels earned. Some familiar post-apocalyptic resource-scarcity beats prevent higher score.</comment>
