<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied trauma responses and contradictory impulses act simultaneously throughout, particularly in the proprioceptive enhancement as both curse and tool. The final choice to remove the strap and pivot toward calculating grace is earned through prior causality with visible cost in his "displaced rootedness."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens coheres as trauma memories, sensory details, and the mathematics quest build toward a Conceptual Repricing where mercy becomes "a dynamic potential to be enacted." Cost is legible in the "permanent dissonance" and the energy required to choose kindness, though the final beat could land with more visceral weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest functions as both setting and metaphor, with light as penance constraining perception and choice. The pewter strap's pressure points mapped through proprioceptive sense demonstrates how body-as-setting shapes the decisive action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure from passive victim to active agent, with the strap removal as the tightening moment that transforms observation into action. The shift from being experimented upon to choosing his "first deliberate act of grace" forecloses the path of passive suffering with clear cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mathematics of mercy emerges organically from the concrete struggle with the strap, transforming from abstract quest to embodied choice. The final realization that mercy "required a choice, a braced will against the momentum of cruelty" reweights all prior suffering without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through the proprioceptive enhancement creates a unique lens of hyper-awareness. Rhythmic control modulates from the pharmaceutical haze through rage to focused concentration, with purposeful compression in trauma flashbacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid sensory work ("ultraviolet shards," "chromatic dance"), though some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("symphony of wrongness," "fragile thing"). The "braced will against the momentum of cruelty" and similar constructions edge toward elevated diction that slightly distances the visceral experience.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The proprioceptive enhancement as interrogation side-effect weaponized for mercy-seeking offers a fresh angle on trauma recovery. The ultraviolet forest as penance-space and the mathematical approach to quantifying mercy create an original synthesis, though the conceptual framework occasionally overshadows lived detail.</comment>
