<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elros's motivation crystallizes through embodied ritual—the seed pods rattling "like tiny bones," his translation of harsh military syllables into blessing. His choice to speak "the poison out of the ground" shows contradictory impulses (preserve/release) acting simultaneously. The final moment of hearing seeds split open pays visible emotional cost through his solitary return "between the immense dark above and the quiet work below."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from dead reef to blooming jetty to seed germination, with the final image of "first green threads" constituting a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the battlefield's meaning. Cost is legible in "speaking the poison out of the ground" and the patience required for this "small, patient task." The persistent constraint of working with dead languages and natural cycles shapes both tactics and the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The blooming jetty functions as micro-setting that constrains Elros's ritual path while the "narrow vastness" creates spatial tension between confined walkway and infinite sea/sky. Sensory hierarchy reflects his priorities—bird calls translate to soil reports, bioluminescent algae pulses mark time. The reef's skeletal remains beneath water mirror the scarred battlefield above, with both environments actively shaping his seeding choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulative deepening as Elros moves from walking to listening to seeding to speaking, each action narrowing his commitment to this restorative work. The shore lark's melody signals "clean earth and maturing grubs," triggering his decisive seeding action. Cost is visible in his acceptance of slowness—"the smallest of sounds, a private, vital mechanics"—foreclosing any path of forced or rapid healing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete action of speaking military commands as blessing, transforming violence's language into permission for growth. The final image of seeds splitting open offers a non-literal answer to healing trauma—acknowledgment before forgetting, "the earth, at last, was answering." The submerged concord between algae and skeletal reef mirrors the pact between past horror and future garden without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Elros's synesthetic translation of bird calls into soil conditions and his selective attention to "tiny bones" rattling in seed pods. Rhythmic control heightens under pressure as prose shifts from flowing description to staccato fragments when seeds begin splitting: "It was the smallest of sounds, a private, vital mechanics." No dialogue preserves the meditative solitude essential to his work.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"ghostly, bioluminescent algae now clung to the rocks, casting a soft, blue pulse" establishes setting, time, atmosphere, and transformation simultaneously. Syntactic variety supports scene rhythm, from the long opening sentence establishing scope to short, decisive fragments at germination. No loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle; prose maintains clarity through peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of healing land through speaking dead languages transforms the familiar "battlefield to garden" trope through specific ritual mechanics. The synthesis of military history becoming blessing through phonetic remnants feels non-obvious yet inevitable. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure and absence of dialogue heightens the meditative stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
