I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference**: This operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens - the story builds through sensory detail, historical resonance, and psychic accumulation toward Elara's transformed understanding. The closure arrives through density increase and reweighting rather than causal turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from detached investigator to witness carries genuine weight through the psychic jolt sequence. The internal contradiction between her "calculated silence" and the raw emotions she absorbs creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for Leo remaining somewhat abstract despite his centrality to the emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost - Elara's professional mission "irrevocably altered" - though the emotional price could be more visceral. The accumulative structure coheres well through sensory layering and historical parallels. Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "controlling influence" and the explain-everything quality of paragraph 4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tunnel setting actively constrains and enables discovery, with excellent sensory specificity ("wet concrete and distant decay"). The lantern functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. The spatial choreography and environmental pressure effectively support the accumulative build.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding Leo's death) deepens through the psychic revelation, but escalation relies heavily on a single moment rather than progressive tightening. The cost is more conceptual than visceral - Elara's transformation lacks immediate dramatic consequence beyond her "unorthodox report."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The freedom/imprisonment theme emerges organically through the Underground Railroad parallel, avoiding explicit moralizing until the final paragraph. The resonance between historical and contemporary struggles enriches without forcing allegory. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract "chains on its sons and daughters" metaphor that edges toward thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in the investigative voice and sensory selection. The prose modulates effectively during the psychic experience. Deduction for occasional register drift into academic territory ("empirical observation," "dissect tragedy") and some filter-verb reliance ("She felt," "She understood").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("forgotten artery of the city"). Some overwriting in the psychic sequence with stacked abstractions ("violent cascade of entangled memories"). Minor template cadence in "She was... She would..." construction. The final paragraph contains unnecessary exposition that could trust the dramatization more.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The psychometric object concept offers a fresh angle on historical investigation, and the Underground Railroad connection provides unexpected depth. The synthesis of past and present trauma through a shared object shows genuine ingenuity, though the execution occasionally relies on familiar investigator tropes.</comment>
