I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where Thea's ritualistic sewing and sleepwalking build toward a transformative reconfiguration of both the labyrinth and her community's relationship with the sea.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Thea's "hauntingly optimistic" nature manifests through concrete action—sewing air itself, sleepwalking the labyrinth path—with her motivation clearly rooted in transforming ruin to reverence. The contradiction between her smile holding "the ghost of all they had lost" and her forward momentum creates genuine complexity, though some interior states rely on assertion rather than embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres beautifully as nightly rituals compound into transformation, with the water following quartz threads as a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the entire journey. The cost is visible in Thea's exhaustion and the community's lost precedents, though the transformation's mechanics occasionally strain plausibility without fuller grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting actively shapes the story—its murals of "forgotten gods and weathered tales of prideful sailors" provide the old stories Thea must overlay, while the stone basin becomes the focal point for transformation. The sensory detail of "bone-white moon" and "glowing red walls" creates atmosphere that supports the mythic tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Thea's deepening engagement with the labyrinth—from sewing air to tracing quartz veins to the final prayer at the basin. The transformation carries clear cost in abandoning old ways, though the conflict lacks active opposition beyond inertia.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between "old precedents" and new patterns, with the labyrinth's transformation from dead stone to "living, flowing map" embodying the shift from hubris to humility. The final image of emptying tide pools as "invitation to walk the path again" resonantly reframes loss as renewal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The mythic register maintains consistency with phrases like "wharf weaver" and "orchid solace," creating a distinct texture. Some passages edge toward purple prose ("sewed the air itself"), but the voice coheres around Thea's poetic perception and the story's fable-like quality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose flows with intentional rhythm—"She awoke walking, her bare feet finding a familiar groove in stone"—though occasional overwriting appears ("hauntingly optimistic," "luminous, perfectly still pool"). The mythic tone occasionally substitutes elevated diction for concrete detail, particularly in emotional beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of sewing air to create physical transformation offers genuine originality, as does the overlapping of conscious practice with unconscious journey. The synthesis of weaving, labyrinths, and tidal cycles creates a fresh mythic ecology, though some elements feel consciously literary.</comment>
