<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her healing-with-words attribute creates genuine internal conflict when she cannot heal her own grief. The dream sequence with her mentor provides earned insight through embodied experience rather than epiphany. However, the final pivot to writing as communal healing feels slightly rushed, lacking the visceral cost that would elevate to higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkage from failed attempts → dream revelation → understanding → action. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms personal discovery into communal purpose, with the cost being her shift from academic achievement to shared burden. The dream sequence effectively bridges the problem-solution gap through dramatized revelation rather than convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The observatory setting with its brass telescopes and star charts creates atmosphere and enables the central discovery through the equatorial telescope. Sensory details like "ozone and old paper" and "leaden stars" filter through Elara's exhausted perception. The setting constrains choice by requiring astronomical observation for the solution, meeting the 9+ gate requirement minimally.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal frustration through grief to cosmic responsibility as Elara discovers the temple's warning about stellar decay. The dream provides the crucial tightening that transforms static inscriptions into dynamic celestial score. The final burden of transforming potential panic into unifying purpose carries weight, though the transition from discovery to writing could show more immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of shared burdens emerges organically through the temple's purpose—not a monument but a communal warning system. The variable stars metaphor (breathing, alive language vs fixed translation) enriches the central question. The ending transforms individual discovery into collective healing without explicit moralizing, though the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent academic-poetic register appropriate to Elara's chronicler role, with selective perception focused on celestial and textual details. The dream sequence shifts psychic distance effectively. Dialogue in the dream carries subtext about methodology. Minor filter verb accumulation ("she realized," "she knew") in the resolution slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between waking frustration and dream revelation. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing plot or atmosphere. Some template phrasing appears ("She rushed to," "She began to," "She had to") and the penultimate paragraph contains slight paraphrase loops about shared burdens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The variable stars as living syntax offers a fresh angle on ancient language decipherment, moving beyond typical archaeological discovery. The synthesis of astronomy, linguistics, and emotional healing creates an organic whole. However, the "chosen one deciphers ancient warning" frame follows familiar patterns without sufficient transformation through lived detail.</comment>
