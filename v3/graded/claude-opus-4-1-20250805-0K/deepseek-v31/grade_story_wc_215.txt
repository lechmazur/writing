<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's tranquil perception and patient observation create a distinctive character whose motivation to preserve unspoken stories emerges naturally from his reclusive nature. The woman-ghost's arrival forces a meaningful choice between passive observation and active preservation, with visible cost in accepting responsibility for the covenant. Minor deduction for some abstraction in describing the ghosts' "mute eloquence" and "tangled covenant" rather than fully embodying these concepts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through ghost interactions building to the stained glass box discovery as Resonant Reconfiguration. The final image of Silas and the woman-ghost sharing "companionable silence" with "their mutual understanding a perfect, unspoken sentence" crystallizes the covenant's meaning with felt cost of eternal witness. Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The beekeeping oasis as "stubborn patch of green defiance" against wasteland creates vivid contrast that shapes Silas's role as preserver. The stained glass box's tactile discovery ("fingers touched cool, smooth glass") and cleaning ritual ground the abstract covenant in physical action. The honey house and windowsill placement constrain choices and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from observing ghosts to understanding their silent language to accepting responsibility for the woman-ghost's urgent need. The pressure coheres through her "vibrating with desperate silence" and builds to Silas accepting the weight of preservation. Cost is visible in the "tangible weight" settling on his shoulders and the permanent commitment to safeguarding their stories.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the stained glass panels telling a story of "sowing, growth, vibrant oasis...then blight" that mirrors the larger covenant between past and future. The box as "silent sermon, wordless monument" offers a non-literal answer about preservation without moralizing. The final shared silence reweights all prior ghost interactions as community rather than haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice through constructions like "shimmering into being" and "mute eloquence" creates literary texture. POV remains controlled with Silas's perceptual signature of patient observation. Some elevated diction ("ethereal throats," "tangled covenant") occasionally drifts from the established tranquil observer voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations and strong image density. Minor template cadence in ghost descriptions ("farmer ghost forever shading," "child-ghost tracing circles"). Some abstract phrasing ("mute eloquence," "tangled covenant") that could be more concrete, though these serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of ghosts as silent witnesses carrying unspoken words offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic fiction. The stained glass box as physical covenant and the specific detail of extinct flowers in the panels elevate beyond generic haunting. However, the ghost-communication framework follows somewhat familiar patterns without fully transforming them.</comment>
