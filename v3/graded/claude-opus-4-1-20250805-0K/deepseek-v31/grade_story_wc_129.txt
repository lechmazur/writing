<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelin's motivation to connect with community drives consistent choices throughout, from the initial offering to the final dedication. The internal shift from individual artist to communal historian feels earned through concrete discovery. Minor deduction for the community's somewhat uniform reaction pattern and lack of deeper internal contradiction during the search phase.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kaelin's sculpture dedication transforms both the arbor's meaning and their place in community, with clear cost (abandoning individual recognition). The accumulative lens holds as tags build toward pattern revelation. Slight deduction for the convenience of the final tag's placement and overly neat resolution of the artist's identity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor effectively constrain choices and charge the final image. The marsh-reed/crystal duality creates meaningful texture. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("shimmering," "glimmering") and the underdeveloped crater setting that doesn't fully pressure the action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal offering to communal mystery to collective identity reformation. The search creates genuine pressure that narrows options. Deduction for the somewhat convenient mapping of tags and the lack of meaningful opposition or cost during the middle search phase.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the arbor's transformation from shrine to record, and individual art becoming collective memory. The final dedication reweights all prior material without stating a moral. The marsh-reed within the painted arbor creates a resonant synthesis of preservation and creation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with artistic perception filtering details ("calloused from weaving," "luminescent ache"). Some elegant moments of free indirect style. Deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't match Kaelin's established voice and minimal dialogue that could have added texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Several instances of repetitive phrasing ("glimmering obsidian arbor" appears unchanged, "luminescent ache" recycled) and some abstract constructions ("monument to silence," "world beyond the murmur") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of graffiti as historical preservation offers a fresh angle on vandalism versus art. The integration of marsh-reed sculpture with crystalline setting creates specificity. Some derivative elements in the community-discovery arc and the overly neat resolution prevent higher scoring.</comment>
