<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes from archival duty to rescue mission with genuine urgency, and her final choice to carry Kenneth's truth shows earned transformation with visible cost. The retrocognitive trap creates contradictory impulses (fear vs. duty) acted out in scene, though some interiority edges toward explanatory rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (lagoon's phosphorescent response) building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara becomes living archive for state murder—cost is legible in "solemn heart ascending." The diary cipher revelation through supernatural dialogue earns its place, though the convenience of Kenneth's consciousness surviving strains slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon functions as both setting and active participant, constraining choice through its volcanic glass prison and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects archivist's tactile attention to paper, indentations, and arranged debris with purposeful selectivity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from academic research to witnessing murder to becoming testimony's vessel, with the lagoon's supernatural response forcing stance crystallization. The dominant stake (uncovering suppressed truth) tightens through each revelation, though Kenneth's preserved consciousness arrives somewhat conveniently.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the diary's lock, arranged debris messages, phosphorescent words—building to resonant answer about memory as both trap and liberation. The final image of ascending with truth in her "solemn heart" reweights the opening's sanctuary as necessary distance from horror.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through archivist's attention to documents, indentations, and patterns, with controlled psychic distance shifts during the retrocognitive vision. Some register elevation ("searing reverie," "volcanic eye") occasionally strains against otherwise grounded voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("shadow a vast, silent kite") but occasional overwriting ("glint of panic in a young man's eyes as he hid this very book" unnecessarily doubles the panic). Some elevated diction in peak beats ("retrocognitively trapped," "phosphorescent seaweed") creates mild register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The supernatural archive concept—consciousness trapped in volcanic glass, communication through arranged debris—offers fresh angle on civil rights documentation. The synthesis of historical investigation with paranormal witness testimony feels earned and specific to this world's logic.</comment>
