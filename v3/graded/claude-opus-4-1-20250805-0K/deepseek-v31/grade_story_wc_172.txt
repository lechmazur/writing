<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses—amoral opportunist versus secret sentimentalist—act simultaneously throughout, culminating in his release of the egg as "the only authentic act of his life." The final choice is earned through prior causality with visible cost (losing his irreplaceable fossil). Minor deduction for slight therapy-speak ("secretly sentimental core") but the embodied contradiction and earned renunciation secure strong execution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias releases the egg, transforming from "jailer" to liberator with visible cost (losing the incalculable fossil). The causal lens holds: his manufactured drought → storm breaks control → realization → release. Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words. The "chaos variable" typo and slight ambiguity in the Chinese character prevent 8.8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The salt flat actively constrains choice through the map of cracks leading to the "place of old power," and the fissure becomes the specific release point. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("gritty whisper," "bleached earth"). The setting doesn't quite charge the final image as powerfully as it could, keeping this below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation follows causal logic: manufactured drought → storm breaks control → internal pressure builds → release decision. The cost is unmistakable (losing the irreplaceable egg). One meaningful tightening occurs as the rain forces recognition that he's the egg's "jailer." Doesn't reach 8.8+ because the external storm does more work than protagonist agency in driving the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the preservation/release paradox, with the egg serving as concrete particular for extinct echoes. The final image offers a resonant answer without stating a moral: "The echo was finally free, and so, in his own broken way, was he." Strong thematic coherence through specifics rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elias's selective attention to geological detail and the egg's texture. Voice modulates appropriately with emotional intensity. The "chaos变量" appears to be a technical error rather than intentional, and some phrases edge toward purple prose ("fractured grace," "ossified tear"), preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery. However, several issues accumulate: the "chaos变量" error, occasional overwriting ("perfect ossified tear," "fractured grace"), and some template phrasing ("It was..." repetitions). Information density is good but these artifacts prevent entry to higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The core premise of an amoral philanthropist who manufactures crises offers a fresh angle, and the specific synthesis of drought-maker releasing a fossil feels non-obvious. The transformation from curator to liberator emerges from established particulars. Doesn't reach higher bands due to some familiar beats in the epiphany structure.</comment>
