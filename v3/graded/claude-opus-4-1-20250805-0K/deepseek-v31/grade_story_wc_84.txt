<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from contract worker to sacred duty bearer is earned through embodied discovery, with her "perpetually surprised expression" gaining genuine cause. The pilgrim's desperation and Elara's pilot instincts create believable motivation, though some interior moments lean toward abstraction ("seeker's pilgrimage") rather than concrete thought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal drive from pilgrim's arrival through frequency discovery to Elara's transformed mission, with the chip serving as physical key to conceptual revelation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara becomes "a tuning fork for the soul," with clear cost in her shifted worldview and new burden. The orientation anchors cleanly establish who/where/when early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory's "brilliant dimness" and corroded telescope create atmospheric pressure, while the chip's "tiny city of grooves and valleys" provides tactile specificity. The setting constrains choice when the telescope points downward rather than up, forcing Elara to kneel and engage physically. Some descriptive moments could be more selective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from decoding an abstract phrase to understanding planetary disconnection, with the telescope's unexpected behavior creating a meaningful reversal. The cost becomes legible when Elara must "teach them how to listen"—a burden she didn't seek. Pressure could tighten further through more concrete obstacles.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the frequency metaphor—connection versus severance, sight versus sound—without explicit moralizing. The final image of Elara as sound-guide for a sight-navigator resonates strongly. "The missing pieces were not data, but sensation" crystallizes the thematic question through earned discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent third-limited with selective perception ("dust motes dancing like slow-motion fireworks") that reflects Elara's aerial perspective. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("celestial schematic") that slightly strains the POV's lexicon. Dialogue absence is appropriate for this solitary discovery scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("star trails frozen in mid-motion") but occasionally loops concepts ("frequency of belonging" appears multiple times without variation). Some filter constructions ("She saw," "She understood") dull immediacy in key beats. Rhythm varies effectively between action and reflection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The reversal of telescope pointing down rather than up provides fresh surprise, and the concept of planetary frequency as belonging offers non-obvious synthesis. However, the mystical key-and-lock resolution follows familiar patterns. The specific detail of type foundry matrix chip as cosmic key shows originality within convention.</comment>
