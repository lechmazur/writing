I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows a because/therefore chain of discovery, with each finding leading Elara deeper into the conspiracy.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes believably from curiosity to moral urgency as discoveries accumulate. Her "bright attentiveness" manifests through pattern recognition driving investigation. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("the felt of the virtual patch seemed to radiate a profound, sensed absence") that lacks embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear causal chain from pattern discovery through investigation to horrifying revelation, with visible cost in Elara's transformation from archivist to witness of corporate murder. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - she solves the mystery but faces a "looming presence" with clear implications. The recurring numbers shift from mystery to countdown, reweighting everything.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The digital archive setting constrains investigation methods and provides specific tools (sub-archives, encryption, black box data). "The hum of servers and the glow of screens" grounds us immediately. Setting becomes increasingly oppressive as revelations mount, though some descriptions remain abstract ("digital ephemera").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity through corporate cover-up to existential threat as the numbers become "a countdown, a signal getting closer to home." Each discovery narrows Elara's options - she can't unknow what she's learned. The final realization that deletion means absorption creates irreversible knowledge with clear cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central question "where do deleted files go?" becoming a meditation on corporate erasure of human lives. The patch image recurs with deepening significance. Final revelation that the deleted aren't gone but transformed offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire archive's purpose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical register appropriate to Elara's profession with selective perception ("the method of her unease"). Some filter-heavy passages ("She had found where the deleted files went") slightly dull immediacy. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance that tightens during discoveries.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations tracking discovery beats. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("masterpiece of omission," "profound, sensed absence") and some repetitive structures. The captain's fragmented transmission provides effective syntactic break. Minor template cadence in middle investigation sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of data archaeology with cosmic horror - the concept that deleted data becomes sentient/absorbed is genuinely unsettling. The transformation of a routine integrity check into existential discovery feels earned. Risk-taking in the ambiguous ending where threat looms without resolution heightens impact.</comment>
