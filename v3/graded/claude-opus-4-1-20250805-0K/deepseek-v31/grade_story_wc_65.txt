I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inferred: Causal** - The story operates through clear because/therefore linkages as Silas moves from reviewing data to discovering the geothermal solution to writing it on the Blank Page.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and his internal process well-rendered through the "groundedly imaginative" contradiction. The progression from reviewing "cascading sequences" to focusing on the anomaly shows genuine internal conflict. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed - the jump from 0.0001% to certainty needs more embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal structure with clear closure - Silas writes the reactor design that the Page accepts, transforming possibility into truth. The constraint of the Blank Page creates genuine tension. Cost is visible in the risk of failure and the stakes of energy depletion, though the success feels slightly too clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake create a vivid, constraining environment that mirrors the story's themes. The "monochrome cold" contrasts effectively with the kingfisher feather's warmth. The geothermal anomaly beneath the lake becomes essential to the solution, making setting integral to plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear - energy grid failure versus innovation. The constraint of the Blank Page creates genuine pressure. The escalation from safe prediction to revolutionary design works, though the transformation from 0.0001% to certainty happens too quickly to feel fully earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of "charting voids" and seeding innovation within constraint. The ending delivers on this without stating it explicitly. The transformation from probable to true future resonates, though it verges on being too neat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and matches Silas's methodical nature. Technical language like "sociological shift vectors" fits the POV. Some phrases feel overwrought ("theater of his mind"), but overall the prose maintains appropriate distance and register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum. Some overwriting appears ("sacred duty," "pure potential," "symphony of data"). The phrase "groundedly imaginative, a necessary contradiction" works well. Minor issues with elevated diction in places but doesn't harm closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of an "ignorance cartographer" who maps what isn't known is fresh and compelling. The Blank Page constraint that only accepts inevitable truth creates genuine originality. The synthesis of constraint and innovation feels earned, though the resolution is perhaps too tidy.</comment>
