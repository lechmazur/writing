<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to understand "the texture of time passing" drives concrete actions through the garage sale scheme, with the cremation fragment serving as a tactile anchor for his obsession. The young woman provides meaningful pressure that crystallizes Leo's need for connection rather than just comprehension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of his initial goal before it transforms into the more concrete need for shared perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through Leo's daily ritual, the garage sale preparations, and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the woman's understanding transforms his isolation into connection. The cost is felt in the shift from casting messages into chaos to receiving genuine recognition. The piece teaches its pattern early through the texture metaphor and pays it off when connection becomes "the smooth, cool comfort" echoing the fragment's physical quality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The emerald silo functions as both physical container and metaphor for Leo's isolation, its "rust-streaked" decay mirroring the post-Upheaval world. Tactile details like the ceramic shard's smoothness and coolness constrain Leo's daily ritual and charge the final image. The garage sale items accumulate specific texture without overwhelming the narrative focus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Leo's private obsession through the public vulnerability of the garage sale to the crushing disappointment when messages go unnoticed, then reverse through the woman's recognition. The dominant stake—finding meaning in unmeasurable time—tightens when Leo risks exposure through his cryptic messages. Cost is visible in his "bitter and expected" disappointment before the reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete problem of measuring the unmeasurable, developing through Leo's tactile relationship with the fragment and culminating in the realization that time's texture lies in connection rather than solitary comprehension. The final image of "smooth, cool comfort of connection" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral. The piece earns its wisdom through Leo's specific journey from isolation to recognition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevation appropriate to Leo's former role as timekeeper, with selective perception focused on temporal and tactile details. The woman's dialogue carries authentic subtext, recognizing not just the message but its deeper meaning about "the hour that exists outside the count." Minor deduction for slight register elevation in some descriptive passages that occasionally drift from Leo's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm that mirrors Leo's measured existence. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing both external action and internal state. Some figurative language in early passages ("borrowed-time timekeeper," "hollow hours") borders on overwrought but doesn't obscure clarity at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of measuring unmeasurable time offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic fiction, avoiding typical survival concerns for philosophical exploration. The garage sale as message-in-a-bottle method shows ingenuity, and the transformation from seeking understanding to finding connection feels earned. The specific detail of embedding temporal philosophy in mundane item descriptions creates memorable originality.</comment>
