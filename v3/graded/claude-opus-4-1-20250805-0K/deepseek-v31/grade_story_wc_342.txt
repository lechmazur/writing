I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece - the story builds through layered discoveries and sensory details toward a resonant transformation where Elara captures infinity in the wall.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and specific - capturing celestial light before spaces vanish. Her face-blindness creates a unique perceptual signature that drives her obsession with spaces. The final choice to use her palm instead of a brush shows urgency under pressure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure building through discoveries: coin's true pattern, wax impression as key, hidden compartment, celestial pigment. Closure lands powerfully as Elara transforms the wall into "a window into a forever she had saved," with clear cost (building's imminent destruction). The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tree trunk library and fractal carvings aren't mere backdrop but enable the story's resolution - the coin's pattern matches the wall's fractals, unlocking the pigment. "Air smelled of damp paper and forgotten wisdom" grounds us sensually. The setting literally constrains choice as demolition approaches.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Demolition deadline creates genuine urgency that tightens through "time bleeding away" to "first hammer blow." Stakes escalate from preserving memory to discovering cosmic paint to racing destruction. The cost is palpable - she achieves transcendence just as everything crashes down.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between permanence and destruction, with the fractal pattern serving as a physical manifestation of infinite complexity within finite space. The ending offers a non-literal answer: art can capture infinity even as material reality crumbles. "She could not see her own expression of awe" beautifully embodies theme through absence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical quality with controlled rhythm: "At the hush just before a condemned building is demolished, the world held its breath." POV stays tightly focused through Elara's unique perception. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("fractally precise," "topography of immense complexity") that slightly exceeds character lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("needle's point," "solidified moonlight") and occasional redundancy ("quiet obsession" could be just "obsession"). The final image powerfully synthesizes all elements without excess.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Face-blind portrait artist who captures spaces rather than faces offers fresh perspective. The fractal pattern connecting coin, wall, and lock creates satisfying conceptual unity. The celestial pigment discovery feels slightly convenient but is grounded in the scholar's guild mythology.</comment>
