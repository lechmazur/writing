<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes from ennui to sharp focus when the storm offers escape, with her need to discover "what happens after goodbye" driving the climactic choice. The internal shift from "ancient apathy" to "chilling focus" embodies genuine change under pressure. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract articulation of her betrayal backstory, though the emotional core lands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal closure as Elara exploits the storm-induced instability through her dimensional awareness and cursed fragment to achieve escape, with clear cost (fragment's destruction, facing unknown consequences). The "achieved her goodbye" resonates as earned change. Slight deduction for compressed middle mechanics that could use one more beat of tactical adjustment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite's "constantly shifting lattice of crystalline light" creates vivid constraint, and the storm's effect on "angles bent where they should have been rigid" grounds the escape method. The fragment growing "hotter" provides tactile urgency. Deduction for limited sensory range beyond visual/thermal and some abstract spatial descriptions ("nowhere and everywhere").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds from passive observation to active exploitation as the storm creates opportunity, with Elara using the fragment as a magnetic lens to unravel the wall. The cost manifests in the fragment's destruction and entering unknown danger. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient alignment of storm timing with her readiness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete question "what happens after goodbye" which reframes imprisonment as existential curiosity rather than punishment. The final image of moving "toward the whispers of a forgotten history" resonates without moralizing. Slight deduction for not fully exploring the betrayal's moral complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends cosmic scope with intimate perception ("silence so profound it hummed," "measured eternity in grains of sand"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("magnificent fury," "ferocious energy") that slightly exceeds established diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and varied syntax, particularly in action sequences ("The wall didn't break; it unraveled"). Information density high throughout. Deductions for minor redundancies ("ancient apathy"/"long buried under layers of ennui") and some abstract phrasing in spatial descriptions that slightly dulls clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dimensional awareness concept offers fresh perspective on prison-break narrative, and the cursed fragment as magnetic lens shows inventive problem-solving. However, the immortal-prisoner setup and solar storm convenience feel somewhat familiar. The specific execution elevates but doesn't fully transform the archetype.</comment>
