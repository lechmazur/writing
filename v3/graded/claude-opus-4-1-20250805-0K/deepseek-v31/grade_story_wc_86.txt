<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict between guilt and professional duty drives meaningful choices, particularly her decision to "untether" from the past mistake. The shame mirroring between her and Kael creates authentic emotional complexity. Deduction for slight overarticulation in the final exchange ("Then we understand it") that borders on therapeutic clarity rather than embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where both characters choose to abandon their shared anchor to failure, with cost visible in leaving the drawer pull as "a small, discarded key to a door they had both decided to close forever." The causal lens holds: mistake leads to capture, which drives exchange, which enables shared recognition and release. Deduction for cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mist-shrouded pass and moon-phase timing mechanism constrain the exchange choreography effectively. "Storm-worn, windblown parapet" and "slick stones" create tactile immediacy. The drawer pull functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Minor deduction for not fully exploiting how the seventy-two breath window might pressure the exchange itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on Elara's need to transform guilt into wisdom through this personal exchange. The moon's brief illumination creates temporal pressure, and Kael's shame that "mirrored her own" deepens the emotional cost. However, the actual exchange lacks dramatic tension—no real obstacles threaten the resolution once they meet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the drawer pull's transformation from "interlocking chains" of confinement to something that can be "understood" and released. The final act of leaving it behind resonates as earned wisdom about moving forward. Slight deduction for the near-explicit articulation "The lesson was the wisdom, and the wisdom was to move on."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent thoughtful distance with selective details like "permanent furrowed hush" matching setting and character. Dialogue feels natural with appropriate subtext ("A token...From his cell"). Minor voice convergence in the final exchange where both characters speak with similar articulation levels despite stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong atmospheric density with phrases like "a seam in the world stitched together only by tentative truces." Some repetitive phrasing ("furrowed hush" appears twice) and slight overwriting in metaphoric density ("profound emotional arithmetic"). The filter verb "understood" in paragraph 6 dulls immediacy at a crucial realization moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The drawer pull as a tangible artifact of imprisonment that becomes a shared token of release offers a fresh angle on reconciliation narratives. The moon-phase exchange mechanism adds specificity. However, the resolution toward mutual understanding follows a somewhat predictable arc without surprising transformation.</comment>
