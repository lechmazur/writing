<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma (mother's disappearance), driving escalating choices through the maze restoration. The internal conflict between being "retrocognitively trapped" and seeking resolution plays out concretely through her interaction with the halo fragment. The final choice to "unpick that stitch" and free both herself and her mother shows earned agency with visible cost (letting go of the loop that defined her).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkages: discovery of fragment → vision of mother → understanding maze as temporal equation → using fragment to unbend time. Closure lands with a Decisive Change (mother returns, photographs disintegrate) with visible cost (the loop that bound them dissolves). The orientation is clear by ~100 words, and the hyperbolic geometry concept meaningfully constrains the resolution method.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The living bridge garden setting directly constrains choices (where Elara finds the fragment) and provides the laboratory for her temporal experiments. Sensory details like "scent of freshly-cut yew" and the fragment "cool-to-the-touch" ground key moments. The maze's non-Euclidean geometry becomes essential to solving the problem, though some descriptions lean abstract ("texture of time itself").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from botanical restoration → discovering the fragment → understanding mother's fate → risking temporal unbending. The dominant stake (freeing mother and self from temporal loop) tightens when Elara realizes she must "unpick that stitch" with clear risk. The cost is legible: dissolving the memory loop that has defined her, with the photographs' disintegration marking permanent change.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of time as "folded surface" and maze as temporal map, avoiding abstract philosophizing. The final image of taking her mother's "real and warm and present" hand resonates against the earlier fading photographs without stating a moral. The concept of time's texture develops from abstract desire to embodied understanding through specific experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elara's academic mindset ("retrocognitively trapped," "hyperbolic geometry"). The perceptual signature shows her architect's eye noting structure and geometry. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("quaking reverie," "texture of time itself") but rhythm generally supports the dreamlike tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("The maze was a temporal equation") but suffers from abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy ("to feel the grain of years as one might feel the grain of wood"). Some overwriting appears ("quaking reverie," "haunting echo") without clear payoff. Information density is moderate; several sentences restate rather than advance ("The memory was a loop, a haunting echo she could neither escape nor fully recall").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of maze-as-temporal-equation offers a fresh angle on time travel, grounded in mathematical specificity (hyperbolic geometry). The transformation from trapped memory to active unbending shows earned insight. However, the resolution mechanism feels somewhat convenient, and phrases like "texture of time" remain abstract rather than viscerally specific.</comment>
