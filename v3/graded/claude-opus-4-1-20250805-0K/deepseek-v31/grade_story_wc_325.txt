<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobia creates genuine internal tension against her spelunking expertise, with embodied fear ("cold, metallic taste," "chest tighten," "vision swim") driving micro-choices under pressure. The motivation to "stand by the unremembered" is clear and tested through action, though the final transformation could be more viscerally costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear causal progression from tidal window → facility exploration → codex discovery → phase transition revelation → return with testimony. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (bearing witness replaces data retrieval) with felt cost in the phase transition experience, though the emotional price of carrying this knowledge could be more explicit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The facility's "cathedral of ruin" and undersea cables effectively constrain movement and discovery paths, while the tidal deadline creates genuine urgency. Sensory details like "crashing hush" and the golden light's heat-haze path serve the plot, though some descriptions ("jagged teeth of the cove") lean toward stock imagery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from physical danger (tide) to existential revelation (phase transition/translation of researchers), with the narrowing service conduit forcing Elara to overcome claustrophobia. The cost of witnessing feels somewhat abstract; the physical/emotional toll of the phase transition experience needs sharper articulation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of bearing witness to the forgotten emerges through concrete discovery rather than statement, with the phase transition serving as both plot device and metaphor for transformation of understanding. The shift from seeking data to carrying testimony resonates, though the nature of "something humanity was not meant to see" remains deliberately but perhaps overly vague.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV maintains consistent close third with selective perception ("her headlamp beam cut through the gloom") and character-specific noticing of technical details. Some phrases drift toward purple prose ("cathedral of ruin," "river of light") that slightly dilute the technical precision elsewhere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and momentum, though several stock phrases appear ("jagged teeth," "dark maw," "hammering of her own heart"). The phase transition sequence achieves genuine lyricism, but phrases like "standing promise" and "memory of light" edge toward abstraction without sufficient grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The codex as phase-transition key and the researchers' "translation" rather than death offer fresh angles on the abandoned facility trope. The integration of undersea cables for listening to something deep below adds specificity, though the ultimate revelation remains safely ambiguous.</comment>
