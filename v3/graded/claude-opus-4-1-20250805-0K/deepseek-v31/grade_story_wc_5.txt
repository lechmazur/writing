I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered ritual actions and sensory accumulation toward a resonant transformation of grief into permanent art.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is consistently rooted in translating grief into permanence, with embodied patience shown through "hours, her back straight and her hands resting palm-up." The internal conflict between her flash-paper past and current stillness creates authentic tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "moving stillness" and "tableau holding its pose for millennia."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds through ritual pattern-making to the sealing transformation. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration - grief literally sealed into metal with the "cold and brilliant" flash-paper burn marking irreversible cost. The starlight's consumption and the map's permanent embedding show clear before/after with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The withered orchard crater creates essential containment for the ritual work - "its rim holding back the howling winds." Sensory details like "brittle lichen," "fallen bird bones," and "glacier-roses, long dead and pressed flat" directly constrain Elara's pattern-making choices. The setting's "moving stillness" charges the final image of captured breath.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as each pattern element builds toward the starlight's recognition - "waiting for the faint starlight in the vial to brighten." The cost manifests in the decade spent condensing starlight now "dark, its purpose fulfilled." One meaningful deepening through the mother's death constellation adequately raises emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of translating ephemeral heartbeats into permanent maps without explicit moralizing. The final image of "a silent testament etched in metal and memory" offers resonant answer to loss through art-making. The transformation from "flash-paper alchemist" to patient mapmaker embodies thematic depth about permanence versus transience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm - "Her entire body demonstrated patience physically" shows purposeful compression. Perceptual signature evident in how Elara notices patterns in "scattered petals" and "brittle lichen." Minor register elevation in "cartography" and "synthesis" slightly exceeds the established lexicon but doesn't harm clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs - "The star-ink did not scratch the surface; it seeped into the metal." Some overwriting in "perpetual twilight" and "profound silence" clusters early. Template cadence appears briefly with "She did not..." constructions but resolves. The prose achieves strong momentum through the ritual sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy and cartography creates non-obvious angle on grief work. The specific combination of "safekept starlight" as ink and copper plate as medium feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric mode and ritual structure heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
