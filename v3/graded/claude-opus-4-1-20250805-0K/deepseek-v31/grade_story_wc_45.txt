I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category against the rubric's high standards.

**Drive Lens: Causal** - The story operates through clear because/therefore linkages: discovery of changeling → finding the tooth → using it as compass → entering Fae realm → healing son → negotiating truce.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's dual nature as "forgiving skeptic" and "shrewdly innocent" mother drives authentic choices under pressure. The bonesetting knowledge pays off causally when she heals Leo's arm. Minor deduction for the Fae's unexplored motivation and their somewhat passive final presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from changeling discovery through tooth-as-compass to realm crossing and negotiation. The Charged Poise ending crystallizes options with the tooth as "bridge, not weapon." Cost is visible in Leo's injury and Aris's torn shirt/risk. Slight opacity around how exactly the tooth functions as portal key.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The secret garden and Fae realm create atmospheric pressure and supply the crucial tooth. Sensory details like "iron-rich water" and twilight-tinged mirror world are evocative. The maze constrains access meaningfully. Some spatial choreography in the Fae realm could be clearer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from passive grief to active quest to physical healing to diplomatic standoff. The tooth discovery tightens options into a single path forward. Cost manifests in Leo's broken arm and Aris's calculated risk. The final negotiation moment could use slightly more pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of transforming "mistakes into constellations" emerges organically through the Fae's error becoming Aris's compass. The tooth shifts from evidence to bridge, reweighting its meaning. The ending offers a non-literal answer about finding connection through imperfection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains scholarly precision ("historian's eye," "catalog") while allowing maternal emotion. The perceptual signature of noticing details others miss is consistent. Slight register elevation in phrases like "nostalgic innovation" and "coalesced into a plan" doesn't quite match the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative moments like "fountain that wept iron-rich water." Some overwriting in "nostalgic innovation" and "alchemy: to turn mistakes into constellations." The phrase "shrewdly innocent" appears twice verbatim. Minor filter verb clustering in the Fae realm section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The changeling tooth as the Fae's mistake becoming a compass is clever. The bonesetting skill naturalistically established through grandfather backstory pays off unexpectedly. The setup feels slightly derivative of changeling folklore but gains specificity through the tooth detail and negotiation ending.</comment>
