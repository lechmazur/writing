<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—protecting vulnerable voices of the dead—and drives her specific actions through tracking pulses to speaking reassurance. The internal experience is concrete ("reeling hush," physical handling of objects) though the emotional embodiment could deepen. The final choice to assure the fading heart shows earned agency with visible cost (the mother's peace achieved, message bridged).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—the mother's trapped love message finally received and peace granted, with felt cost in the "one long, sustained, and peaceful tone" dissolving. The pattern accumulates through tracking pulses, recognizing the lullaby rhythm, then speaking back to complete the circuit. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Elara, atrium at twilight, contact tracer role).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium with its "fractured and weeping" glass dome creates atmospheric pressure that shapes Elara's tracking method through the condensing silence. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"static hiss," "thump-thump-thump," moonbeam piercing dome. The hearing aid as micro-setting constrains her method and enables the connection, qualifying for higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—delivering the mother's trapped message of love—tightens through tracking faint pulses to recognizing the lullaby pattern to the urgency of fading energy. Agency manifests in Elara's decision to speak back into the void rather than just listen. Cost is legible in the mother's decades of waiting and the daughter's absence from grief, though the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concept of "incidental heroism"—Elara becomes an unintended bridge for love that needs to cross over. The final image of the photograph glowing with new light resonates without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the lullaby rhythm as reassurance rather than fear, avoiding sentimentality while maintaining emotional honesty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled atmosphere—"reeling hush," "ghosts of conversations," "resonant tuner." POV remains stable with appropriate narrative modesty about what Elara can perceive. The prose modulates effectively from description to urgent action ("She had to act"), though some phrases edge toward elevated register ("ephemeral atrium").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is solid—most lines advance atmosphere, action, or stakes. Some elevated diction creeps in ("ephemeral atrium," "profound reassurance") that slightly clashes with POV register. Minor template tendency in "She [verb]" constructions but not pervasive enough for major deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh angle on ghost story/medium tropes through the specific concept of "contact tracer for hearts" and the hearing aid as resonant tuner. The lullaby-as-reassurance reversal and mother's love trapped in place for decades show genuine emotional specificity. The intersection of technology (hearing aid) with emotional haunting creates memorable particularity.</comment>
