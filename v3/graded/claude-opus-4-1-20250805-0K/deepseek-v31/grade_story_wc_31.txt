<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's obsession with discovering "the true color of sound" drives concrete action through diving into the sunken ship, with internal contradiction between his solitary existence and desperate search. The final moment where he "finally heard it" lands with earned revelation, though the emotional embodiment could be more visceral in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the glowing algae, sky lanterns, and luminous vow building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Silas's quest resolves through the "soft, green-gold glow of a promise kept." Orientation anchors (pier, lamplighter, festival night) establish early, and the closure lands with conceptual cost—the realization that what he sought was not in sound but in preserved love.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The submerged library as "haunting cathedral of water and knowledge" with floating pages and bioluminescent algae creates vivid, selective detail that constrains Silas's choices through water pressure and decay. The green-gold light functions as micro-setting that directly charges the final image, though some descriptions like "small, swaying suns" feel slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from lighting routine through three dives with increasing discovery—porthole glimpse, key retrieval, then vow recovery—each narrowing Silas's options toward revelation. The "meteor hush" and silent sky lanterns create coherent pressure, though the physical danger of diving remains understated for potential heightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete pairing of sensory synesthesia with preserved love, avoiding abstraction. The final line "the color of the sound of true love was the exact soft, green-gold glow" offers a resonant answer that reweights all prior searching without stating a moral, transforming Silas's quest from personal obsession to universal recognition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Silas's synesthetic lens ("bloomed in his mind not as a noise, but as a shimmering, indescribable hue") with controlled modulation between contemplative wandering and urgent diving. Some elevated diction ("aqueous room," "Aethelred") fits the literary tone though occasionally distances from immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though "haunting cathedral of water and knowledge" and "constellation born from the earth" edge toward purple. Information density is high with most lines advancing multiple functions, but phrases like "profound and expectant quality" and "simple, perfect note" rely on modifiers over specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synesthetic quest for "the true color of sound" offers a fresh angle on obsession, with the underwater library discovery feeling earned rather than convenient. The synthesis of sensory crossover with preserved love creates memorable specificity, though the setup of a lamplighter discovering exactly what he seeks strains coincidence slightly.</comment>
