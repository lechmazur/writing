I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This story operates under a **Causal lens** - Elara's discovery of the disturbance causes her descent, which causes her to find the rupture, which causes her to heal it using the origami swan's hidden instructions.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes from passive observation to active preservation with clear internal stakes. The transformation from witness to healer is earned through concrete pressure, though her emotional complexity could deepen further during the crisis moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from disturbance to descent to healing, with the origami swan providing earned revelation. The closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost ("Exhausted, Elara sat back on her heels"), though the conceptual weight of her shift from observer to actor could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library-as-organism concept brilliantly constrains choice - the "regenerative silence" isn't metaphor but literal force that Elara channels. The obsidian refuge and fracture create specific, irreplaceable pressure points that drive the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal peace to existential threat to the library's ecosystem. The pressure tightens effectively through descent into increasingly hostile space, though the actual healing moment could face more resistance to heighten cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The map/territory wisdom pays off brilliantly through the literal unfolding of the swan revealing hidden knowledge. Theme emerges organically from the tension between observation and intervention, with the final image of refolding the swan crystallizing acceptance of recurring responsibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevation ("placid lake," "convulsed," "regenerative silence"). The perceptual signature of someone who experiences reality through textual metaphors is consistent, though occasional phrases like "crumbling peace" feel slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong momentum, but some figurative density clusters ("crumbling peace, a tranquility forever on the verge of collapse") and repetitive constructions ("She did not...She needed to...She invited...She focused...She was not"). The filter-verb stack in the healing sequence ("She focused on...drawing it...pushing it") dulls immediacy at a crucial moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The library-as-living-organism and keeper-as-filter concepts feel fresh, particularly the inversion where silence heals rather than isolates. The origami swan transformation from memento to map to instruction manual shows genuine ingenuity.</comment>
