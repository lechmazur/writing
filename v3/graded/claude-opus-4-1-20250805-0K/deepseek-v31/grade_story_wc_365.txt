<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is crystal clear and drives every choice, with the cyclical spontaneous ability creating genuine constraint. The internal conflict between discovery and bearing the weight of truth lands with cost in the final moment. Minor deduction for the convenience of the ability's peak timing coinciding with narrative need.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong causal drive with clear closure as Elara accepts the weight of completing Aris's work—a Decisive Change with visible cost. The redirect mechanism creates elegant causality where Aris's sacrifice directly enables Elara's discovery. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution of all mysteries through one vision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The derelict spaceport bay functions beyond setting—it's where worlds touch, enabling the story's core mechanism. Sensory detail effectively filters through Elara's unique perception ("texture of adjacent realities"). The green shard's physical properties ("cool and strangely dense") ground the fantastical elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate beautifully from personal mystery to understanding sacrifice to accepting dangerous purpose. The revelation that Elara's ability resonates with Aris's redirect creates meaningful tightening. Cost is unmistakable: from seeking truth to bearing its terrible weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the weight metaphor—withheld truth literally has mass that must be carried forward. The anchor device works on multiple levels (physical, metaphorical, functional). Final image of glass as "promise and weapon" resonantly answers the central question without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled technical vocabulary ("probabilistic flow," "redirect") that fits the character's expertise. Strong perceptual signature in how Elara experiences reality-bleeding. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in emotional peaks ("immense and crushing").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("symphony of rust and silence"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in the vision sequence and occasional elevated diction ("terrible purpose").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of multiverse navigation with sensory cartography creates genuine originality. The redirect mechanism as both plot device and thematic vehicle shows sophisticated integration. The specific detail of reality-mapping through sensory bleeding feels genuinely inventive.</comment>
