I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration where Master Hira integrates his donor's way of seeing.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Master Hira's transformation from "watchful" to "quietly explosive" drives authentic internal conflict. The contradiction between his methodical nature and the donor heart's narrative magnetism creates genuine tension that culminates in integration rather than resolution. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract handling of "magnetizing stories" which could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Hira receives "not just an organ, but an entire way of seeing" with clear emotional cost - the loss of his former quiet self. The accumulative structure coheres through color/light imagery building to the illuminated wing's revelation. Slight dock for the orientation taking until "Tuesday" to fully anchor when.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of setting as active constraint - the "Follow the light where it pools thickest" instruction makes environment essential to plot progression. The Floating Rock Tea House's impossible suspension "anchored by massive, ancient vines" creates memorable specificity. The morpho wing's "iridescent caution" that "truth depends entirely on the angle of light" perfectly marries object to theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake - understanding why some magnetize stories - deepens through the sun-trail navigation and tea house revelation. Cost is visible in Hira's transformation from observer to participant in narrative. However, the conflict lacks a sharp tightening moment; the revelation arrives somewhat smoothly despite strong atmospheric pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor: "true understanding does not come from being told...It comes from being led to the precipice to see for oneself." The morpho wing's transformation from warning to illumination reweights all prior searching. The final insight that the answer is "not a why, but a how" offers genuine wisdom without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevation - "a still pond hiding a depth charge of unasked questions" shows sophisticated metaphorical thinking. The perceptual signature remains consistent: a dye master's precision with color extends naturally to tracking light. Minor dock for occasional register elevation ("celestial river") that slightly exceeds the established range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs - "The wing was not merely blue; it was a lesson in iridescent caution." Excellent rhythm variation between long contemplative sentences and short declarations. Some minor redundancy in the middle section's description of following light trails prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of organ donation with story magnetism offers genuine freshness - not the expected medical or spiritual angle but a narrative inheritance. The method of navigation by light pooling shows inventive world-building. Risk-taking in the magical realist floating tea house pays off by maintaining internal consistency.</comment>
