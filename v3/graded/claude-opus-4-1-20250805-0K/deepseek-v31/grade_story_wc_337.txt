I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through the unraveling process, with each knot releasing accumulated memory and sensation until the final release reweights the dominant stake of spiritual unrest.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in her role as mask restorer, with concrete embodied sensations ("cold dread seeped into her fingers," "phantom taste of salt water"). The spiritual communication through sensation rather than dialogue shows sophisticated character work. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("weary acceptance") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the unraveling transforms both spirit and restorer, with visible cost in Kael's guilt and brother's death. The accumulative structure builds effectively through sensory revelation. The piece teaches its pattern early (unraveling nets reveals memories) and pays it off. Minor deduction for slightly abstract cost description in final moments.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary effectively constrains the work through its glass dome and coastal setting, with starlight as active participant. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("salt-stiffened net... like a sleeping serpent"). The net functions as micro-setting that drives choice. Slight deduction for underutilized spatial possibilities of the cliff-edge location.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as each knot reveals more of Kael's shame, with the "monstrous, tangled fist" as the climactic revelation. The cost is legible in the brother's death and Kael's century of guilt. The unraveling method creates genuine tension through its painstaking nature. Minor deduction for predictable resolution pattern.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of unraveling guilt, with the net serving as both literal and metaphorical vessel. The "confession in reverse" concept enriches meaning without explicit moralizing. The final image of "light with the quiet of a story finally, and fully, told" resonates without stating a moral. Slight deduction for occasional thematic transparency.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("a woven tapestry of withheld breaths and unanswered prayers"). POV remains stable with Elara as focal point. Some elevated diction ("exhume," "lucid") fits the sacred context. Deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds character lexicon ("interlaced hush").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some paraphrase loops appear ("accumulated silence" concept repeated), and occasional abstract phrasing ("profound quiet" followed by elaboration) creates minor redundancy. The "sleeping serpent" metaphor works well.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of mask restoration as spiritual archaeology offers fresh angle on ghost stories. The specific method of unraveling nets to release memories shows originality. The brother's death revelation transforms the drowning from accident to tragedy. Some familiar elements (guilt-anchored spirits) are made specific through tactile detail.</comment>
