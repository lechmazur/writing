<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied grief through the leaf blower conducting, with contradictory impulses (mournful eagerness) acting in scene. The final choice to walk toward his wife through the tunnel is earned through prior causality. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("heart a heavy stone") rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure - the wife's laugh transforms the tunnel from echo chamber of grief to bridge between them. Cost is visible in tears, lost voice, and the year of silence. The final image of walking "not toward a happy ending, but toward a beginning" reweights all prior material with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tunnel's acoustics constrain and enable the central action - its perfect cylindrical design amplifies and layers sound in ways essential to the emotional breakthrough. Setting actively shapes tactics through sonic manipulation. Slightly limited by minimal sensory detail beyond sound.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative intensity - from engine drone to haunting moan to layered lullaby to exhausted silence, each phase deepening the emotional excavation. The wife's unexpected laugh creates meaningful reversal. Cost is legible in physical exhaustion and emotional depletion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the metaphor of sound engineering as grief work - "macerate the stark, sharp-edged memory" into "compost from which something new might eventually grow." The final shift from "haunting" to "tending" reweights the entire performance without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in the technical-emotional fusion ("leaf blower symphony conductor," "modified leaf blower"). Voice maintains consistency through grief-work metaphors. Some filter verb accumulation ("He looked," "He gripped") prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid metaphors ("dust sheet, thick and suffocating"). Template cadence appears in middle section ("He yanked...He adjusted...He began") and some paraphrase loops around the grief theme reduce momentum. Final paragraph recovers with powerful closing image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of leaf blower as musical instrument for grief processing - specific and non-obvious. The acoustic tunnel performance feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the extended metaphor heightens stakes (+0.4 within band for unconventional approach that maintains clarity).</comment>
