<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's obsession drives genuine stakes through concrete action (the demonstration), and Vesh's transformation from "icy warmth" skepticism to "raw discovery" tracks causally with visible cost—his worldview permanently altered. The contradictory impulses (professional skepticism vs. curiosity) act simultaneously in Vesh's hand stopping Aris from reversing the lever, earning the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Vesh's universe "forever shifted sideways" with the cost of his former certainty visibly paid through "no trace of ice left." The causal lens holds throughout—each lever adjustment builds toward the boundary-thinning climax where a future creature acknowledges them. Orientation anchors cleanly (station, aviary, characters' roles) by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nexus device constrains choices (Aris must reverse the lever when boundaries thin) and the aviary setting enables the demonstration through its ghostly egg/future bird imagery. Sensory detail effectively narrows during tension ("only light...only sound") and the "mechanically warm glow/hum" creates consistent atmosphere that charges the final dormant grey state.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate causally from past echo to future possibility to the critical "potential now" where boundaries thin dangerously. Vesh's intervention ("Wait") creates the decisive turn where scientific discovery overrides safety, with clear cost when the creature's acknowledgment forces him to confront an impossible truth. The tightening from demonstration to dangerous contact forecloses Vesh's skeptical worldview.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete demonstration that time "pools...eddies...moves sideways" rather than flowing forward, with the final image of time settling "back into its familiar, linear stream" while Vesh remains permanently altered. The ghost-song bleeding across timelines and the creature's knowing gaze create resonance without stating a moral about perception versus reality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voices: Aris's "steady hum" of certainty versus Vesh's "clipped" skepticism shifting to breathless discovery. The perceptual signature shows through selective detail (Vesh notices the "eerie glow," Aris focuses on technical calibration). Minor convergence when both characters' dialogue becomes similarly hushed/whispered during the climactic moment slightly weakens distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation ("Wait," he breathed) and purposeful repetition of "only" to narrow focus. Some redundancy in "silent hours"/"nocturnal stillness" and slight overwriting in "ancient and knowing" eyes, but information density remains high with most sentences advancing multiple layers (atmosphere, stakes, character state).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The sideways-time concept offers a fresh angle on temporal manipulation through the specific "local temporal signature" reading and holographic mapping rather than generic time travel. The transformation from skeptic to believer through visceral encounter rather than explanation provides originality, though the scientist-proves-theory frame is somewhat familiar.</comment>
