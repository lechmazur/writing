<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Both characters demonstrate clear, consistent motivations that drive the duel-as-cipher concept, with Valerius's mechanical precision contrasting Elara's fluid grace. The final choice to collaborate rather than claim victory alone shows earned character development with visible cost (the competitive advantage). Minor deduction for "diplomatically fierce" reading as a label rather than fully embodied trait.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal structure where the duel's geometric movements solve the needle-card cipher, leading to a Decisive Change when they unlock the hidden library. The cost is legible—they must abandon opposition for partnership. Slight deduction for the convenience of the sundial's presence, though it's adequately integrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass atrium functions as both arena and map, with the specific green-tinted pane serving as the crucial environmental constraint that shapes the solution. The mechanical arm's "delicate whir" and brook's murmur create atmospheric texture. Deduction for minimal sensory detail beyond visual during the actual combat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (solving the cipher to find lost knowledge) escalates through the duel's increasing precision requirements, culminating in the forty-five-degree angle that unlocks the solution. Cost is visible when Valerius chooses collaboration over victory. Minor deduction as the opposition between characters could have generated more friction before resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of "turning questions into destinations" emerges organically through the duel-as-language concept, with the final collaboration reweighting their initial opposition. The needle-card cipher works as both literal puzzle and metaphor for coded communication. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of "lost knowledge" as the prize.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV through Valerius with controlled, formal diction matching the philosophical protagonist. "Diplomatically fierce" and "dignified chaos" show distinctive voice choices. Deduction for minimal dialogue and some register elevation ("supreme elegant," "violent poetry") that occasionally distances the reader.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm during the combat sequence. However, several instances of elevated diction border on purple prose ("violent poetry of their conflict," "crystalline space"), and there's some conceptual redundancy in explaining the duel-as-code concept. The filter verb "saw" in paragraph 4 could be stronger.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a fencing duel as geometric cipher offers genuine originality, avoiding typical combat-for-conflict patterns. The mechanical arm provides fresh specificity without becoming mere ornament. Deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution and the library-as-treasure being a familiar quest endpoint.</comment>
