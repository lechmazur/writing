<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's cautious hope worn into physical creases and her compulsive need to "outwit cosmic tricksters" create genuine internal contradiction, particularly when she violates her own protocols. The final moment of "cautious hope battered but not broken" shows earned endurance with visible cost. Minor deduction for Leo's thin presence as functional assistant rather than pressure source.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal drive where discovery of subsonic manipulation leads directly to counter-broadcast decision, creating clear before/after with crowds "waking from a shared dream." Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost ("exhausted," "battered") and the signal dissolving. The "infinite game" framing charges the ending with ongoing stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The station's "cluttered nest of humming consoles" and astronomical charts "plastered across every vertical surface" create lived-in specificity that enables the repurposing action. The subsonic discovery through concert hall sub-woofers cleverly uses setting resources. However, the broader university/town dividing lacks concrete sensory grounding beyond reported crowds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds from signal detection through subsonic discovery to active counter-broadcast, with each step narrowing Aris's options toward protocol violation. The cost is legible in her exhaustion and the acknowledgment of entering an "infinite game." Strong agency through her decisive action despite knowing she's breaking "every protocol she had ever sworn to uphold."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of manipulation versus autonomy emerges through the "magician's flourish" metaphor and subliminal control revelation, avoiding direct statement. The ending's "endless, silent questions" and "infinite game" reframe the victory as ongoing vigilance rather than resolution. Slight deduction for the overly neat "sonic mirror" solution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in Aris's scientific framing ("static," "syntax," "carrier wave") and her particular way of seeing patterns as potential deception. Dialogue between Aris and Leo carries professional subtext and advances discovery. Minor convergence in Leo's voice, which lacks distinction from Aris's register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in the building tension of "For hours, they worked" sequence. Information density high in technical passages. Deductions for filter-verb cluster ("seemed to roll," "felt like") and slight template cadence in "She looked... She had... She had won" sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The subsonic manipulation concept offers a fresh angle on first contact stories, subverting benevolent alien tropes. The "cosmic tricksters" frame and treating human minds as "playground" shows specific vision. However, the counter-broadcast solution feels somewhat convenient, and the crowd manipulation borders on familiar mind-control territory.</comment>
