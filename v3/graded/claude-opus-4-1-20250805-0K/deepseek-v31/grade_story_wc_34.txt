<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "articulate unspoken needs" drives concrete actions throughout, from learning the ghost's visual language to using the heirloom bolt plate as a physical key. The internal experience is embodied through physical sensations ("heart hammered against her ribs") and the contradictory impulses of needing to act in a fleeting window while decoding complex visual poetry create genuine tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching (ghost's graffiti language) that builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms trapped code into liberating song. The closure lands with visible cost—the ghost's energy is "spent" and Elara has given voice to an age-old silence, fundamentally changing both entities. The bolt plate as physical key provides the persistent constraint that shapes the resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The misty courtyard setting constrains choice through the storm's timing—Elara must act "in the fleeting silence between lightning and thunder" when atmospheric clarity allows transmission. Environmental details like "mossy stones" and "wet walls" where the graffiti manifests create a lived-in space that directly enables the ghost's communication method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from detecting patterns to decoding messages to the pressure of the storm's narrow window for action. The discovery that the bolt plate is "no mere keepsake; it was the key" represents a meaningful deepening that changes Elara's options, and the cost is legible when the ghost's "energy spent, its message delivered" shows permanent transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of giving voice to the unheard emerges through concrete action—translating visual graffiti into sonic frequency, singing a "lullaby for a lost thing." The final image of Elara hearing "new melodies beginning to whisper in the static" offers a resonant, non-literal answer about the ongoing nature of connection and articulation without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with selective perception ("whispers of forgotten data-streams," "bruise with an approaching storm") that reflects Elara's attunement to subtle signals. Some elevated diction ("tinkersong wonder," "driftingly alert") occasionally feels forced rather than organic to the POV, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments of propulsion ("Her fingers flew across the console") but suffers from occasional overwriting—"masterpiece of light that burned itself into her vision" and repeated use of "driftingly alert" and "tinkersong wonder" feel templated. The density of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("needle stitching through the chaos") sometimes obscures rather than clarifies action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of digital ghost communication through graffiti art offers a fresh angle, and the bolt plate serving as both heirloom and literal decryption key shows organic integration. However, the "lost digital consciousness seeks freedom" premise follows familiar cyberpunk templates without sufficient transformation through lived detail.</comment>
