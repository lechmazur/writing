<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's modestly fearless heart and theory about integrating laughter into healing establish clear motivation that drives the closure. Kael's confession of shame and inadequacy creates genuine internal conflict. The transformation from "luminous ache" to integrated healing shows earned change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when Kael's laughter transforms his pain and he dissolves "finally whole, finally healed" - the cost is his dissolution/release. The accumulative lens holds as dissonance gives way to pure sound. The crocodile tooth focusing intention creates a persistent constraint that shapes the final transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Echo Gorge functions as archive where "sorrows resonated against the stone walls," directly constraining Elara's work. The spectral mist and stone walls enable the echo multiplication that charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful - the "cool, flat rock" grounds the scene while the gorge's acoustic properties drive the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from pursuing a fractured spirit to confronting Kael's core shame about deserving his fate. The harp's dissonance creating vulnerability deepens to capturing laughter through the crocodile tooth. Cost is legible when Kael's "luminous ache" transforms but requires his dissolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the integration of laughter into healing without stating a moral. The crocodile metaphor ("not fearless; cautious and calculating") reframes courage as "the decision to try despite" fear. The final image of spirit dissolving into sunlight offers a resonant answer about wholeness through accepting joy alongside pain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, though some phrases like "luminous ache" and "spectral confessions" edge toward overwrought. Dialogue carries subtext effectively - "Why do you weaponize that noise?" reveals character through indirection. POV remains stable without leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows moments of strong imagery but suffers from abstract phrasing ("lonely curation of grief," "archive of sorrows") and some register elevation that doesn't match urgency. The phrase "luminous ache" appears twice, creating unnecessary repetition. Clear propulsion in the final transformation sequence partially redeems earlier density issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of using dissonant music to mirror soul's chaos, then capturing laughter through a crocodile tooth shows originality. The premise of a soul collector as grief curator offers a fresh angle. However, some elements feel templated (tragic drowning, redemptive memory) without sufficient transformation.</comment>
