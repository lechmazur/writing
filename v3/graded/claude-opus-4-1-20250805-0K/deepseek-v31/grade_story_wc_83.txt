I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This story operates under a **Hybrid** lens, beginning with Accumulative/Textural elements (the quiet observatory, the meditative focus on the geode) before shifting to Causal mode when the perturbation triggers Kaelen's awakening. The closure maintains this hybrid nature through both the transformation (causal) and the resonant final image of altered parameters (accumulative).

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation as a trauma survivor seeking purpose is embodied through concrete action (tracing the geode, moving through corridors with new sight). The transformation from blocked existence to permeating the pool of potential shows genuine internal conflict resolved through earned change, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("a symphony of overlapping, half-seen frequencies").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Kaelen's integration with the telescope's purpose, fundamentally altering both his role and the machine's parameters. The perturbation theory creates clear causality from vibration to awakening to final transformation, with visible cost in accepting his trauma as "a dark current within." The hybrid lens holds consistently through closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating observatory setting directly enables the story's central mechanism—the circuit breakers' cooling period creates the necessary stillness for perturbation. Sensory details like "ozone and cold metal" and "rhythmic thrumming" ground the abstract concepts, though the mirror chamber's physical properties could be more tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds from internal frustration through awakening to active hunting for the "quietest place," with Kaelen's agency driving each transition. The cost manifests in his acceptance of permanent trauma ("the horror...was all there") while choosing to engage with possibility, though the middle section could tighten the pressure between revelation and action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of potential versus actuality emerges organically through the geode metaphor and extends to Kaelen's transformation from "ghost" to active agent. The final image of the telescope hunting "places where unused potential pooled" offers a non-literal answer to the story's central question about purpose after trauma.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance with effective modulation during the awakening sequence ("not with his eyes, but with his mind"). Some passages strain toward purple prose ("fierce, brilliant explosion of amethyst crystals"), but the perceptual shift after awakening distinctly alters the narrative texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong moments like "the air...tasted of ozone and cold metal" but suffers from abstract density in places ("a symphony of overlapping, half-seen frequencies"). Some redundancy appears in the awakening sequence, and phrases like "intangibly tangible" repeat without adding precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of perturbation theory with personal trauma and astronomical observation creates an original framework. The transformation of a scientific concept into a mechanism for spiritual awakening shows genuine ingenuity, particularly in how the telescope becomes an extension of Kaelen's altered perception.</comment>
