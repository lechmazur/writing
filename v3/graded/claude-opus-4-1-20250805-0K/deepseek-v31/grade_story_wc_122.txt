<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Inara's motivation to defeat emotional numbness through teaching vibration-based music is clearly embodied and drives concrete choices throughout. The internal contradiction between her loss and her determination creates authentic tension, particularly in how she transforms her disability into a teaching method. Minor deduction for Leo's relatively thin characterization beyond his frustration and transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through vibration patterns, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence becomes "sacred" with clear emotional cost. The progression from individual teaching to public performance creates meaningful tightening. The closure lands with visible cost in the "wave of quiet approval" that Inara feels as warmth on her skin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drum maker's cavern as a space that "absorbs all resonance" directly constrains how music must be taught and experienced, shaping every tactical choice. Tactile details of stone walls, stretched hides, and temperature shifts create lived-in specificity. The setting enables the final transformation where silence itself becomes the medium.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness through connection—escalates from private teaching to public performance with clear cost in vulnerability. The pressure coheres through Leo's progression from "jagged tremor" to "glided" bow work. The final "wave of quiet approval" represents earned transformation, though the conflict could have one more intermediate complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of feeling music rather than hearing it, avoiding any explicit moralizing. The "ghost of music" and "filament of hush given physical form" create resonant non-literal answers to how connection transcends disability. The final image of remaking "silence into something sacred" perfectly reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through vibration and tactile sensation ("jagged tremor," "physical heat," "tiny, frantic vibration"). Voice maintains consistency even under emotional pressure at the recital. Minor deduction for occasional elevation into more writerly register ("magnificent answer," "profound attention") that slightly exceeds Inara's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied rhythm, particularly in describing vibrations. Some elevated diction in peak moments ("managed to enthrall," "utterly silent yet thunderous") creates minor register drift. Occasional redundancy in emotional description ("profound attention" followed by "witnessing a conversation") but no loops touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of teaching music through reverse-played records and pure vibration offers genuine freshness. The transformation of a disability into a teaching method avoids inspiration-porn clichés through specific tactical details. The ending's "wave of quiet approval" where applause becomes silent touch is memorably specific.</comment>
