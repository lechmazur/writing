<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is crystal clear and embodied through his metallic gloves cradling the fragile tessera—a powerful image of empathy in arms of steel. The retrocognitive trap creates genuine internal conflict as he's forced to relive trauma while pursuing his mission. Minor deduction for the woman's motivation being less developed, though her choice carries weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with a Conceptual Repricing closure where renaming history from "Folly" to "First Offering" reweights the entire premise with clear conceptual cost. The retrocognitive vision provides causal linkage between past mercy and present mission. Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shattered sky dome and warm ashen stone create vivid atmosphere while the mosaic tessera functions as micro-setting that directly constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail ("warm coldness," "ozone of energy weapons") is selective and purposeful. The plaza's layered history—past catastrophe and present mission—gives setting real weight in driving the story.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—validating mercy as foundation rather than folly—is clear early and tightens through the vision sequence where we see the actual cost of the woman's choice. The broadcast on open frequency represents meaningful escalation with visible risk. Slight deduction as the external opposition remains abstract rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tessera as a physical embodiment of mercy's fragility and endurance. The renaming from "Folly" to "First Offering" offers a resonant answer to whether compassion in crisis is weakness or strength. The "warm coldness of truth" beautifully captures the painful beauty of the thematic revelation without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with Kaelen's technical precision ("biometrics," "molecular memory") contrasting with sensory vividness of the vision. "Warm coldness" as a recurring phrase effectively modulates tone. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("progenitor of grace") that slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "arms of steel" and the "warm coldness" motif. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "warm coldness" (three uses) and some elevated diction ("aberrant mercy," "progenitor of grace") that occasionally disrupts momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The retrocognitive trap as a method for historical revision offers a fresh angle on time-travel/memory stories. The specific synthesis of archaeological restoration with empathy-building philosophy feels original. However, the mercy-versus-violence dichotomy is somewhat familiar, preventing higher scoring despite strong execution.</comment>
