I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This story operates under a **Causal lens** - Kaelen's engineering adjustments directly cause the ice to cease its advance through vibrational harmonization. The because/therefore linkage is clear throughout.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kaelen's "logically emotional" trait effectively drives his solution - feeling the lighthouse's pain enables his vibrational approach. The final choice to harmonize rather than command shows earned character growth through concrete action. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("panic, cold and sharp") instead of fully embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change occurs when Kaelen achieves sonic absolution, transforming destructive ice movement into "quiet understanding." Cost is visible in the risk taken and the effort required. The causal chain from problem through attempted solution to successful harmonization holds well, though the resolution feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina and lighthouse create genuine constraints - the "groaning, shifting floes" and "shuddering iron frame" shape Kaelen's approach. Strong sensory work with "dissonant groans" felt "as a physical wrongness in his bones." The setting actively pressures choices throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from initial threat through failed aggressive command to successful harmonization. The ice's violent response ("thunderous crack," floe slamming pilings) creates genuine pressure. One meaningful reversal when the harsh frequency fails, forcing tactical shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of harmony versus domination emerges through action - Kaelen must listen and join rather than command. The concept of "sonic absolution" as purification through resonance works thematically. Some explicit thematic statement ("This was not a problem of torque and mechanics alone. It was a conversation") slightly undermines organic emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains engineer's technical precision ("brass instruments," "frequency," "fundamental note") while allowing emotional perception. Some register drift into elevated diction ("fleshly ethereal," "covenant") that doesn't fully match POV. Controlled psychic distance shifts effectively during the crisis moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Several clarity issues: "fleshly ethereal" is opaque, "temperamentally calibrated to be logically emotional" reads as awkward construction, and some purple prose moments ("sunset bleeding across the sky"). Information density is generally good but hampered by occasional overwriting and one instance of near-paraphrase ("violent grinding did not just stop; it transformed").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of achieving peace through vibrational matching rather than force offers a fresh angle on man-versus-nature conflict. The engineer using emotional perception to solve a technical problem shows originality. Some elements feel derivative (ancient artifact, lone guardian trope) without full transformation.</comment>
