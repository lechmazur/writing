I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric with precision.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages from Elara's secret project through the station's collapse to the final triggered capture.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions with her modified camera. The "luminous ache" drives consistent choices, though internal contradiction could be sharper. Her final choice carries visible cost as the station falls around her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from modification to trigger to capture, with clear cost (station's destruction). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - the frozen moment against collapse. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lunar observatory setting directly constrains choices and enables the final capture. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("cool metal," "rolling sea of white"). The falling debris that triggers the mechanism exemplifies environment-as-agent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from experiment to survival to preservation. The station's collapse forces immediate choice with clear cost. Agency manifests in Elara's decision to capture rather than flee, though additional tightening mid-story would strengthen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of capturing the uncatchable during destruction. The "changelessly constant" frozen image against catastrophe offers resonant answer without moralizing. "Escape velocity" works both literally and metaphorically.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical precision appropriate to protagonist's expertise. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Some filter verbs ("She watched," "She focused") slightly dull immediacy during peak tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with good momentum, though some repetitive structures appear ("She had," "She was"). Minor scaffold in emotional labeling ("profound luminous ache of its loss"). Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece well.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of technical photography with cosmic disaster creates non-obvious stakes. The malfunctioning clock as key to success inverts expectation. Risk-taking in the quiet ending amid catastrophe pays off.</comment>
