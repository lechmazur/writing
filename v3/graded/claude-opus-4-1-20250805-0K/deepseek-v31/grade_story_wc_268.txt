<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aetos's motivation is clear and his compressed might/scholarly tenderness contradiction works well. The pretender functions effectively as immediate pressure. Minor deduction for the pretender's somewhat stock villainy ("arrogant fury," theatrical dialogue), though the protagonist's measured response and final action earn the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the rune discovery building to decisive confrontation. Closure lands with visible cost—the pretender's psychic tether severed, his false history unmasked. The "truth is already written" setup pays off when the rune deflects the attack, creating clear before/after reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library setting actively constrains and enables—crystalline dome tracking time, specific books holding crucial knowledge, the rune location driving the search. "Cathedral of knowledge slowly returning to the void" charges atmosphere while "iron gall ink pellet" functions as micro-setting tool. Spatial choreography clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmasking the pretender) established early and escalates through discovery to confrontation. The rune functions as both goal and weapon, creating satisfying convergence. Agency shown through Aetos channeling rather than blocking the attack—choice under pressure with immediate cost to the antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth's permanence emerges through concrete action—ink that "burns truth into the page," the drawn rune that cannot be unwritten. The "smallest of giants" restoring balance resonates without stating a moral. Slight deduction for the pretender's dialogue veering toward explicit ("You scribble nonsense"), though the ending image recovers well.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose has distinct texture with "regally unpretentious grace," "breath of dead civilizations." POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Minor deduction for the pretender's dialogue feeling more written than spoken ("little creature"), and some register elevation in peak moments that slightly exceeds Aetos's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied rhythm. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("cathedral of knowledge slowly returning to the void" during action), some template phrasing ("stood at the end of the aisle"), and slight register drift in metaphorical density during the confrontation that doesn't match established voice patterns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "diminutive titan" concept offers fresh paradox, and using the rune both as research object and active defense shows ingenuity. The library as "graceful collapse" setting feels specific. Deduction for the pretender's somewhat stock presentation and familiar confrontation dynamics, though the channeling-not-blocking choice adds originality.</comment>
