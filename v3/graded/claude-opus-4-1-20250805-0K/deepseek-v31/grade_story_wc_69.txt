<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation is grounded in concrete action (teaching breathing, isolating voices) with embodied tension in Leo's "hard, defensive edge" and transformation to "offering." The final harmonization carries visible cost through "bittersweet peace" and program cancellation, though Leo's internal resistance could be more viscerally rendered beyond "unlearning hatred."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from individual voices to unified chord, with the rosette metaphor teaching the pattern of "sound born from emptiness." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the achieved harmony reweights the cancellation letter's meaning, transforming loss into "proof of what was possible" with clear emotional cost in "expectant resignation settled into profound, bittersweet peace."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The velvet library with "worn spines and autumn light" creates atmosphere, while the zither's rosette becomes functional metaphor constraining Leo's approach ("your breath is your rosette"). Setting could more actively pressure choices beyond providing ambiance, though the "traveled stillness" effectively brackets the piece.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from program cancellation through Leo's resistance to final harmonic achievement, with clear tightening as Eliza strips away voices to isolate problems. Cost is legible in accepting the program's end while creating "fleeting, perfect" proof, though middle pressure could intensify beyond technical instruction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the rosette's "heart...born from emptiness" and the practice of "subtracting noise," culminating in art's persistence "not in a budget line, but in the resonant silence." The final image reweights the cancellation without moralizing, letting the achieved harmony answer the question of what endures.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third with selective perception ("velvet library," "intricate wooden lacework") and modulates effectively from contemplative opening to instructional middle to elegiac close. Dialogue is purposeful and naturalistic ("breathe into the phrase, not attack it"), though Leo remains largely silent, missing opportunity for voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of beauty ("a map of forgotten craft," "shimmering braid of tone") but suffers from abstract telling ("distrust that took time to dissolve") and filter-verb clusters ("She looked at them," "She lifted"). The phrase "unlearning hatred" appears twice without concrete embodiment, creating conceptual redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of music pedagogy with acceptance of institutional loss offers fresh angle on familiar "save the arts program" territory. The rosette-as-breath metaphor and focus on subtraction rather than addition distinguishes the piece, though Leo's transformation arc follows predictable trajectory.</comment>
