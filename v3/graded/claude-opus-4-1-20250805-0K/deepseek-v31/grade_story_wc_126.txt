<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelin's motivation crystallizes through embodied details—the salt-rimed violin case, her daily navigation to the sunken greenhouse—rather than declaration. The final beat shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously as she chooses to unbind trapped echoes rather than create new sound, with visible emotional cost in "turning grief into a kind of grace."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through Resonant Reconfiguration: the single sustained note transforms from seeking beauty to receiving conversation with the dead, with felt cost in "heartbreaking chorus." The bowl's shift from alms-receiving to sound-focusing provides causal throughline, though the rainforest burning backstory slightly dilutes present-frame immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse as acoustic chamber constrains and enables the central choice—its "cavernous, aquatic chapel" properties make possible the unbinding of trapped echoes. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kaelin's acoustic perception ("acoustical texture," "weight and frequency") while the salt-tolerant fruits and rust-weeping skeleton create lived-in specificity that charges the final resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from harbor silence to greenhouse entry to the bowl's placement to the sustained note that finally unbinds trapped sounds. The cost lands explicitly in "heartbreaking chorus of all that was finished and all that was unfinished," though agency reads more as discovery than decisive action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image of the bowl collecting echoes, "turning grief into a kind of grace" without stating a moral. The tradition of listeners rather than storytellers reweights the entire premise, though the final paragraph edges toward slight over-articulation with "conversation" rather than letting the image alone carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through acoustic focus—"acoustical texture," "layer of absence," "weight and frequency"—maintains throughout. Psychic distance modulates effectively from external description to intimate revelation, though occasional elevated diction ("leviathan," "mendicant") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, especially "salt-tolerant fruits grew wild and strange, their twisted branches pressing against the murky panes." Minor template cadence in "She placed...She did not play...She drew" sequence and slight overwriting in "chronic hush" repetition prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The bowl as acoustic receiver rather than alms collector transforms a familiar object through specific function. The synthesis of environmental catastrophe with intimate family tradition feels non-obvious, and the risk of sustaining a single note to unlock trapped sound heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
