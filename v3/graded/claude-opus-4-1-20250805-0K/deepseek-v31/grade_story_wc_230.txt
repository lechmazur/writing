<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict between desperate need for peace and rational recognition of the eye's trap creates genuine contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to use the eye as a tool rather than crutch is earned through prior struggle, with visible cost in accepting "the fear of a long-dead smuggler" as her narrow ledge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Elara chooses the harder path of building resilience rather than stolen solace, with cost visible in accepting temporary suffering for authentic growth. The causal lens holds through discovery → understanding → rejection → redefined use, though the Chinese characters "属于自己的" break immersion without translation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hanging orchard with wind-sculpted trees and glass eye buried beneath roots creates vivid micro-setting that constrains choice—the ravine's "shared anguish" pressures her search while the storm's cacophony crystallizes her decision. Setting actively guides the final choice through environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking silence to confronting the seductive trap of borrowed consciousness, with the storm's arrival forcing immediate decision under pressure. The cost is legible in choosing momentary clarity over permanent escape, though the single reversal (cure discovered → rejected → repurposed) could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of seeking safety through another's imprisonment—"a theft of peace, a different kind of prison"—without moralizing. The final image of using the relic as "trowel" rather than "crutch" offers a non-literal answer about building authentic resilience versus borrowed peace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with selective perception ("fractured grace," "raw nerve") though occasional overwriting ("beautiful, desperate arcs") and the untranslated Chinese disrupts flow. The involuntary truth-telling creates character-specific constraint, particularly in "Your search is pathetic" directed at the tree.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but overwriting appears in peak beats ("symphony of shared suffering," "beautiful trap") creating figurative muddle. The untranslated Chinese characters and occasional purple prose ("fractured grace," "desperate arcs") reduce clarity, though momentum remains strong through varied syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The empathy virus creating involuntary truthfulness offers fresh angle on telepathic overwhelm, while the glass eye as captured consciousness rather than simple cure transforms expected resolution. The choice to use it as tool rather than escape avoids the safety middle, though some metaphors feel familiar.</comment>
