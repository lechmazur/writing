I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor for a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is a Causal lens story - the plot advances through because/therefore linkages as Silas uses logical deduction to uncover truth. The blackout causes him to use alternative methods, which leads to discovering the stamp's hidden meaning, which reveals the vault.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions - his "tranquilly perceptive" nature manifests beautifully when he embraces the blackout's "reclaimed stillness" rather than panicking. The character makes specific micro-choices under pressure (examining the stamp handle, reinterpreting the ledger's clues). Minor deduction for slight emotional flattening during the discovery moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal structure with clear Decisive Change closure - Silas discovers the authentic charter proving "official history was a lie." The because/therefore linkages are tight: blackout forces alternative light source → forces closer examination of stamp → reveals vault numbers → leads to discovery. Cost is conceptually present (the founders' reputation) though could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sunken library setting is exceptional - "grand marble husk settled silently onto the abyssal plain" creates immediate atmosphere. The environment actively constrains choices (blackout forces glowstick use, water damage affects texts, vault location matters). The blue glowstick painting "cavernous room in shifting, eerie patterns" directly shapes the discovery moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding truth behind sanitized history) is signaled early and tightens when initial search fails. The reversal from "dead end" to reinterpreting the stamp as key shows protagonist agency. However, the resolution lacks immediate dramatic cost - we understand the conceptual implications but don't feel the price of this knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between "ornate" official seal and "simpler, cruder design" of the original. The story elegantly explores how history gets "embellished later to aggrandize" without stating this directly. The final image of matching ink blot resonates as proof of "honest truth" versus sanctioned fiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent erudite register appropriate to Silas's profession - "cross-references and meticulously maintained ledges." Some beautiful moments like "blackness so complete it felt solid." Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("primordial quiet") that slightly exceeds the established baseline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments - "pressure-heavy hush" alliterates purposefully. However, several instances of telling over showing ("Frustration, a rare visitor, began to creep in") and some redundancy ("calm surety" after establishing tranquil perception). The phrase "reclaimed stillness" appears twice, though this serves thematic purpose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The sunken library as repository of truth is fresh, avoiding typical archive settings. The twist that the authentication tool itself contains the secret location shows ingenuity. The concept of "reclaimed stillness" during infrastructure failure offers a non-obvious angle on discovery narratives.</comment>
