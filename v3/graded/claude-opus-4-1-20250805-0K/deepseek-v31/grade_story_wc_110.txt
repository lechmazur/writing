<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Anya's motivation to preserve truth is clear and embodied through concrete actions like holding the lens and feeding pages to flames. The internal conflict between duty and mercy plays out through physical choices rather than abstract rumination. However, the transformation from archivist-as-preserver to archivist-as-curator feels slightly rushed; the moral calculus could use one more beat of genuine struggle before the incinerator decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal lens with because/therefore linkages: discovery of lens → investigation of discrepancy → revelation of fraud → moral choice → destruction of evidence. The closure lands as Earned Stasis where Anya refuses to complete the record, with visible cost in betraying her archival duty. The orientation anchors cleanly by line 3, and the single-scene structure maintains unity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive setting functions as more than backdrop—its "resonant hush" and climate-controlled precision establish stakes around truth preservation. The projector lens constrains choice by revealing hidden details, and the crystal forecourt's post-rain atmosphere charges the final burning scene. The sensory palette effectively contrasts sterile archive lights with rain's percussion and the incinerator's heat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to preserve damaging truth or choose mercy—emerges clearly through the lens discovery and escalates via the revealed fraud. The conflict tightens when Anya recognizes the manager's possible confession through donation. However, the opposition feels somewhat abstract; the retired manager never appears on-page, limiting the felt pressure of the moral choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus mercy emerges organically through Anya's choices rather than declaration. The lens metaphor—"sharp at its center but melting into distortion at the edges"—effectively captures truth's ambiguity. The final image of choosing "context over condemnation" resonates without moralizing, though the phrase "freed by honesty" in the last line edges toward explicit theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signatures like Anya's reverence for silence and attention to archival detail. Diction appropriately matches an archivist's precision ("climate-controlled vaults," "transfer documents"). Some phrases feel overwrought ("mausoleum for whispers"), and the final paragraph's explanatory tone ("She was not destroying truth; she was choosing mercy") briefly breaks the showing mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm modulation between contemplative and active beats. Information density is generally high, though some passages contain mild redundancy ("quiet night registrar"/"valued the solitude"). The metaphorical language occasionally strains ("alien artifact," "ghosts of conversations") but doesn't obscure meaning at crucial beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The archive-as-moral-battleground premise offers a fresh angle on truth versus mercy. The specific detail of cryptic doodles hiding financial fraud shows originality. However, the core ethical dilemma of destroying evidence to protect someone follows familiar patterns without significant transformation, and the resolution choosing mercy feels somewhat predetermined.</comment>
