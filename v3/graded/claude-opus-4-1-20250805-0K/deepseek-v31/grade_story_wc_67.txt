<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses—preserving versus releasing, creating versus destroying—operate simultaneously throughout, with her final choice to blur the portrait earned through prior causality. The cost is visceral: she literally merges her mother's remains with the art, foreclosing the path of preservation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the portrait's deliberate obscuring reweights the entire ritual's meaning. The cost is legible in "The face was now obscured, the memory and the reality literally integrated into an indistinguishable whole," showing both physical and emotional price paid on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Vanishing Point Gallery's converging walls and the rocking chair's slowing metronome constrain the ritual's timeframe and emotional pressure. The urn and mask function as micro-settings that shape Elara's choices, though the broader gallery could more actively pressure the action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—crystallizing the emotion of love and loss—tightens through the rocking chair's slowing rhythm and Elara's growing understanding of her own deception. The final blow that obscures the portrait is driven by protagonist agency with visible cost: "The face was now obscured."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of beautiful fictions versus painful truths emerges through the mask's "mirage of safety" and Elara's realization that her portrait is "another kind of container." The final image offers a non-literal answer: truth requires accepting dissolution rather than false preservation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Elara's artist-specific observations ("granular grit," "coarse ash falling in a soft haze"), though some passages drift toward elevated register ("somber marvel of the moment"). The Chinese character "裂纹" appears without translation, creating a minor comprehension gap.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, but abstract phrases like "somber marvel of the moment" and "painful, perfect truth" lack concrete specificity. Some filter-verb clusters ("she understood," "she felt") dull immediacy in middle passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The profession of "charcoal portrait ash scatterer" offers a genuinely fresh angle on grief ritual, and the specific synthesis of medium-as-subject creates inevitable-feeling closure. The mask of shattered porcelain shards as metaphor for false wholeness shows strong conceptual integrity.</comment>
