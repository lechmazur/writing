<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her investigation and final sacrifice. Her transformation from archivist to warrior against the entity shows genuine internal conflict—preserving versus containing—with embodied cost in "forging her hope into a shield." The "luminous regret" becomes physically felt rather than labeled, though some interior passages lean toward explanation over embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: dream acquisition → discovery of anomaly → investigation revealing entity → infection → sacrificial containment. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Aris crystallizes her stance against the entity, with visible cost in her "painful metamorphose." The drive lens reads as Causal with clear because/therefore linkages narrowing her options to this single path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bio-luminous library floating "above the clouds" creates a distinctive setting that enables the dream-storage technology central to the conflict. Sensory details like "crystalline spires and petal-walled reading rooms" establish atmosphere, though middle sections default to functional description. The setting constrains choice through the quarantine protocol but could more actively pressure the final confrontation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from preserving dreams to containing a parasitic entity that feeds on hope. The investigation tightens through video comparison revealing the entity's progression, with Aris's infection raising personal cost. Her agency drives the discovery and containment choice, though the entity's exact threat mechanism could be more viscerally dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between preserved dreams as "vintage wine" versus the entity that metabolizes hope itself. The geomancer's transformation from vibrant to hollow embodies the cost of commodifying inner life. Aris's final act reweights her role from preserver to protector, though the "luminous regret" metaphor occasionally overreaches.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" and "oneiric code," fitting an archivist's perspective. POV remains stable in close third, with controlled psychic distance. Some passages drift toward explanatory register ("She understood luminous regret now") rather than maintaining embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of lyric precision ("dreams were no longer solitary mysteries but could be captured, bottled, and shared like vintage wine"). However, several passages contain mild redundancy ("heavy with a regret that seemed to glow inside her") and filter constructions that distance immediacy. The final paragraph's abstract phrasing ("forging her hope into a shield") lacks concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise of dreams as shareable commodities with a parasitic entity hiding within offers fresh conceptual territory. The investigation method through comparative video analysis provides an original detective approach. However, the resolution defaults to familiar sacrifice-warrior imagery rather than mining the unique possibilities of the dream-library setting.</comment>
