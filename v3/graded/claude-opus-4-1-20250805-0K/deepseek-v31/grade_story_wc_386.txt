I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric systematically.

**Inferred Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered imagery and metaphorical density toward a resonant revelation, with the final image reweighting the accumulated details.

<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and consistent—seeking "one untainted truth from the cacophony"—driving her methodical investigation. The internal contradiction between her desperate need for purity and her immersion in tragedy creates genuine tension. However, the character lacks embodied emotional response during the revelation moment, relying on abstract description ("the ice around her seemed to hold its breath") rather than visceral reaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from establishing Elara's unique ability through the dream-fragment methodology to the insurance fraud revelation. The closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration—the truth exposed "to the universe itself" carries conceptual cost in the purser's eternal guilt. The piece teaches its pattern early (dream harvesting, psychic archaeology) and pays it off, though the final beat could strengthen its felt cost beyond the abstract "terrible fact."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine setting brilliantly constrains and enables the work—"borrowed starlight held fast in ice" mirrors the preservation of trapped memories. Sensory details are selective and purposeful: "frigid and still, smelling of ancient water and burning wax." The melted snow globe as micro-setting functions perfectly, its "warped and bubbled" glass reflecting the distorted memories Elara must clarify.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing the devastating lie—drives coherent pressure through Elara's methodical investigation. The revelation of insurance fraud "gone catastrophically wrong" provides meaningful escalation from accident to intentional act. However, the conflict lacks immediate resistance; Elara faces no active opposition or cost to her discovery beyond the abstract weight of truth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of salvaging truth from wreckage, avoiding explicit moralizing. The snow globe's transformation from gift to weapon to melted artifact creates resonant layers. The final image of ice "holding its breath in reverence" offers a non-literal answer about truth's weight, though it edges toward the precious.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevated diction suits the mythic register: "whisperer to the dead," "steel graves." The perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices in fragments and echoes. Some passages drift into overwrought territory ("borrowed, transient, intimate" for candlelight), but the voice maintains coherence through pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "cacophony of final regrets and terror," "vast, somnolent mosaic." The adjective stacking in places ("frigid and still," "rough-hewn altar") could be pruned for greater impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of a "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" who harvests dream fragments is genuinely original, transforming both ghost story and detective procedural tropes. The specific method—analyzing "cameo appearances in strangers' dreams"—feels fresh and inevitable within the established logic. The insurance fraud motive grounds the supernatural in mundane greed, avoiding precious mysticism.</comment>
