<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Zephyr's obsession to "navigate without moving" drives clear, escalating choices from passive listening to active intervention. Her internal contradiction between reverent observation and necessary action crystallizes beautifully in the climactic decision to physically lever the bone. The final realization that "movement truly meant" listening to the world's motion earns its resonance through prior struggle, though some interiority borders on over-articulation ("her skimmer's mind analysing").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong causal elements, building from sonic disruption through bird-pattern revelation to physical intervention. The closure—Zephyr understanding that navigation requires embracing movement—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (abandoning centuries of passive tradition). The trapped pulse resolution restores equilibrium while fundamentally repricing Zephyr's worldview.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canyon of bone towers creates a unique sonic geography that directly constrains navigation methods and forces the pivotal choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—the "pure, high C" of the arrowhead, the "frantic, chaotic tremor" of disrupted echoes. The arrowhead's dual function as sonic tool and physical lever demonstrates how setting elements shape both problem and solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring navigational order—escalates from passive observation through pattern recognition to physical intervention. The birds' "desperate, chaotic pattern" provides the crucial middle development that bridges problem and solution. Cost is visible in Zephyr's trembling muscles and the fundamental abandonment of her tradition, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly after the discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of static reverence versus necessary action emerges organically through Zephyr's journey from passive listener to active participant. The birds serve as a brilliant thematic bridge—showing that navigation requires reading motion, not avoiding it. The final image of finding "her way home" by understanding "what movement truly meant" offers resonant closure without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent, slightly elevated register appropriate to Zephyr's reverent perspective ("harmonic stone skimmer," "library of fallen ages"). Some passages lean toward over-explanation ("She was learning to see the path through the patterns"), and dialogue absence means we miss potential for subtext. The perceptual signature—reading sound as geography—is distinctive and well-sustained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The deep gorge was a place of bone, not earth") but occasional redundancy ("fleeing" after showing flight, "frantic, chaotic" doubling). Information density is moderate; some sentences do single duty where compression could heighten impact. The "groan that seemed to come from the earth's core" provides effective sensory grounding at the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a sonic navigator in a canyon of leviathan bones offers genuine freshness, avoiding fantasy clichés through specific world-building. The solution—reading bird flight patterns to understand invisible sound distortions—demonstrates creative problem-solving. While the "journey to understanding" arc is familiar, the specific synthesis of sound, bone, and navigation creates memorable distinctiveness.</comment>
