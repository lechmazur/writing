I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas's character builds from specific contradictions—his laughter as "cosmic absurdity" response rather than joy, his isolation paired with world-shaping ambition. The final realization that he "touched the machinery of the world" lands with earned weight through his shift from mockery to "profound, fearful awe." Minor deduction for some tell-heavy passages about his motivation mid-story.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Causal lens with Silas's adjustment causing the light loop, which steers the storm, which prevents the coup. The closure—his realization of prophetic power and decision to "shape the next dawn"—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost in his "fearful awe." The orientation anchors (lighthouse keeper, storm approaching) establish cleanly within the first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse chamber with "green-tinged prisms" and the storm's "ozone and impending violence" create vivid atmosphere. The total internal reflection becomes a constraint that shapes the story's central action. However, some descriptions lean generic ("deep Atlantic dark") and the broader world remains sketchy despite references to "flickering terminals."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Silas's ability to shape fate through the lighthouse—escalates from routine duty through storm management to the realization of historical impact. The "millimeter" adjustment creating the light loop provides clear causal pressure. Cost manifests in his transformation from laughing herald to someone gripped by "fearful awe" at his power.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of unintended consequence and the burden of power emerges through concrete action—the throwaway "Kingmaker" name becoming literal prophecy. The glass wick's "captured starlight" and the light that "steered history" avoid explicit moralizing. Slight deduction for the somewhat mechanical connection between steering ships and steering history.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency with phrases like "laughing storm herald" and "cosmic absurdity," creating a distinct register between archaic and contemporary. The POV holds steady through Silas's perception. Minor issues with register drift in exposition ("political coup that had been simmering") that doesn't fully match Silas's isolated perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("river of green fire circulating in a perfect, endless loop") but suffers from repetitive structures and some overwriting. Multiple sentences beginning with "He" or "The" create monotony. Phrases like "profound, fearful awe" and "wild, triumphant elation" pile modifiers unnecessarily.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse keeper who accidentally shapes history through light manipulation offers a fresh angle on the isolated prophet trope. The total internal reflection as fate-steering mechanism shows originality. However, the coup prevention plot feels somewhat convenient, and the transformation isn't as surprising as it could be.</comment>
