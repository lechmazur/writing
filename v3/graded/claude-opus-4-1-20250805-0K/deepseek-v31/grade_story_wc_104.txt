I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is a **Causal** story - each beat follows because/therefore logic leading to the protagonist's self-sacrifice to secure the seeds.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Liberator's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete details like the chain's weight as "a promise he had made." His final choice between self-preservation and mission completion earns its cost through prior setup. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("silent, unseen resistance") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from infiltration through decoding to self-entrapment, with the Wall's collapse providing urgency. The Earned Stasis closure (choosing imprisonment to protect seeds) lands with clear cost: "Trapped, but the seeds were safe." The arrow-as-cipher discovery drives the middle turn effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting pressures choices through its decay and hidden vault. The piano's "horribly flat" note and "dissonant, stumbling chord" embody the world's brokenness. The chain constrains movement throughout. Loses points for some generic descriptors ("ghostly silhouettes") early on.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from infiltration to confrontation to self-sacrifice. The sentry's arrival forces the ultimate choice between escape and mission. The chain becomes weapon then prison, showing clear cost: "the cold floor seeping through his trousers."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the image of seeds in "dry soil" and "staggering grace" - beauty forced to exist in ugliness. The final vision of "a forest growing from this barren place" resonates without stating a moral. The arrow's "strange fletching" could carry more thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice with selective perception ("Dust motes, thick as felt"). The sentry's brief dialogue carries subtext and threat. Some register elevation in phrases like "purest expression" feels slightly disconnected from the gritty setting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum. The "staggering grace" metaphor works well. Deductions for redundancy ("silent, patiently strategic silence"), some abstract phrasing ("hollowed-out temple of fleeting joy"), and occasional overwriting in descriptive passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The seed vault as humanity's genetic memory offers a fresh take on post-apocalyptic preservation. The carnival setting as hiding place shows originality. However, the self-sacrifice ending and wall-coming-down backdrop feel somewhat familiar from dystopian fiction.</comment>
