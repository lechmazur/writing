I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through lyric imagery and metaphoric density toward a conceptual transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dreamer's motivation crystallizes through embodied action—dragging the telescope, kneeling in frost, dismantling the instrument—with internal conflict between creative memory and "ordinary bone." The dissolution into "a filament of remembered stardust" is earned through prior struggle, though some abstract phrasing ("migraine of unborn constellations") weakens embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where the protagonist dissolves into "traced path" to preserve universal creativity, with visible cost (her physical form). The accumulative structure coheres—each meteor syllable builds toward the final transformation. Minor orientation delay (who/where anchors vague until ~150 words) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The astronomical instrument constrains multiple choices (dismantling it to hear clearer, arranging pieces into "orrery of herself"). The tundra setting and aurora create immediate pressure, with the "perfect circle of dark glass" as lasting environmental change that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal creative memory to universal artistic survival ("every artist born after her would wake up colorblind in the soul"). The three meteor syllables create accumulative pressure, with the final dissolution showing clear cost—she sacrifices physical form to free creativity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the create/perish dichotomy without moralizing, as the ending transforms both into "create again." The childhood memory of scissors cutting paper into "disciplinary squares" grounds the abstract in specific loss. The final invitation to future travelers offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("moonstruck dreamer," "aurora-lit archway"). Some elevated diction strains POV credibility ("equatorial mount," "latitude scale") but the perceptual signature remains consistent—filtering the cosmos through artistic consciousness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with varied sentence lengths creating visual rhythm. Some overwriting in metaphoric density ("migraine of unborn constellations," "shadowed rapture") and abstract phrasing that occasionally obscures clarity. The final paragraph's syntactic control elevates, with no loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of astronomy and creativity that feels inevitable in hindsight. The dismantling of scientific instrument to free artistic memory inverts expected relationships. Risk-taking in the dissolution ending and cosmic scope heightens stakes while maintaining coherence (+0.3 within band).</comment>
