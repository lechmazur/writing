I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through lyric density and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where grief transforms into luminous memorial.

<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The maker's grief is embodied through concrete gestures (polishing moonstone with ritual precision, breathing dream into lungs until ribs glow) rather than labeled emotions. Internal contradiction manifests beautifully as she simultaneously releases and preserves her daughter through the crane transformation. Minor deduction for slight emotional smoothness in the final tea-drinking moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where cranes become "living lanterns that would glow each night for anyone who needed light shaped like goodbye" - grief transforms into communal memorial with clear cost (moonstone crumbles, shadow detaches). The accumulative structure coheres through recurring transformations (dream→paper→birds→lanterns). Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating islands' paradoxical physics ("descend while ascending") constrains the pilgrim's path and mirrors grief's contradictions. Tea bushes that exhale dream fragments create lived-in magical realism. The basilica's architecture of "crystal rods" and "ribbons of living quartz" shapes the ritual's mechanics. Setting consistently pressures choices through its dream-logic rules.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation reads as density increase under the Accumulative lens - each folded crane intensifies the "luminous torment" until 49 birds orbit the maker. The cost is visceral: "tears evaporated into minor constellations," moonstone crumbles, the maker must walk backward to exit. The paradoxical stair that erases sorrow while adding torment creates meaningful pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central image of transforming private grief into public light without stating morals. The recurring motif of light/lanterns (maker's profession, glowing ribs, crane-lanterns) accumulates meaning rather than ornament. The final image of hands smelling "only of tea" instead of kerosene resonantly prices the transformation from craft to grief to release.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice weaves technical precision ("seven strokes water, seven strokes oil") with lyric compression ("grief is only another kind of flame"). Perceptual signature shows a craftsperson's attention to materials and process. Controlled psychic distance maintains intimacy while avoiding head-hopping. Minor syntax repetition in middle sections prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("tears evaporated into minor constellations" conveys emotion, action, and world-logic simultaneously). Some figurative density in peak beats ("galaxy of unfinished bedtime stories") serves the accumulative mode. Occasional template cadence in the folding sequence ("One became seven, seven became forty-nine") reads as intentional ritual patterning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief-as-craft with dream-recording technology creates fresh emotional territory. The specific ritual of polishing dream containers like lighthouse lenses transforms familiar mourning into luminous particularity. Risk-taking with the paradoxical physics and baroque world-building heightens rather than obscures the emotional core. The image of paper cranes becoming permanent lanterns for others transcends template grief narratives.</comment>
