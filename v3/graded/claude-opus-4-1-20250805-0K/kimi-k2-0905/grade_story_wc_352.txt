<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ilyra's prism-minded perception creates genuine complexity through her ability to fracture vision into spectral bands and navigate by color, with the indigo band choice at the kernel demonstrating embodied decision-making under pressure. The final smile knowing "combinations would still remember how to hide" shows earned understanding through concrete struggle, though some interior passages lean toward over-articulation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gravity inversion mechanism creates a hard temporal constraint (31 minutes) that drives every decision, with Ilyra's navigation through threshold effects and dormant seeds building causal pressure toward retrieving the Archive's memory. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as she returns with "every name now restored to its shelf," though the cost could be more viscerally felt beyond the spent doodle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The grotto's clandestinely luminous interior with ultraviolet veins and upward-dripping water creates a genuinely alien environment that constrains movement ("patches where down became sideways"), while the seeds of vigilance embedded in stone directly shape Ilyra's path choices. The indigo band navigation and threshold effects make the setting indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal mission to Archive restoration, with the 31-minute countdown and stirring seeds creating genuine pressure that forces whisper modulation and sprint choices. The final leap "the instant inversion ended" demonstrates earned timing under the gravity constraint, though the physical danger could press harder on specific moments.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of memory preservation emerges through concrete action—speaking combinations aloud to anchor them, the doodle finding its missing tail in absence—rather than declaration. The final image of Ilyra carrying "the latent blaze of every name" in blank paper fibers resonates without moralizing, though the cyclical knowing at the end edges toward tidiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ilyra's perceptual signature—counting heartbeats, fracturing vision, tasting whispers of "iron and childhood"—creates a distinct sensory palette that remains consistent under pressure. The prose modulates from contemplative precision to urgent compression during the escape, maintaining focalization without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines like "each droplet a tiny lantern guiding her deeper" doing multiple jobs, though some passages show mild overwriting ("serpentine grotto sealed, its clandestinely luminous heart dark once more"). The technical vocabulary around gravity inversion and spectral perception serves the world coherently without becoming opaque.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prism-minded perception system and gravity inversion create a genuinely fresh approach to the retrieval quest, with the specific solution of seeing installation moments as color bands feeling both surprising and inevitable. The risk of making navigation depend on spectral vision heightens stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
