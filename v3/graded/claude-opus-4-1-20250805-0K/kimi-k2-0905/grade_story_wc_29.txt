I'll evaluate this story systematically under the demanding editor standard for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages as Lyra discovers the cosmic interference, develops a counter-strategy, and executes it with visible consequences.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied reactions ("velvet migraine pressing behind her eyes," "sweat salted her lips"). Her choice to use chaos against chaos shows tactical evolution under pressure. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness in peak moments that slightly distances the reader from immediate experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from signal discovery through counter-frequency deployment to temporary resolution. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (town's temporary peace, Lyra's exhaustion). The orientation anchors arrive promptly. Slight deduction for the convenience of the exact timing window aligning perfectly with her preparation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail ("sodium lights that painted the quad the color of dried blood," "smelled of burnt solder and decades of vinyl dust") grounds the setting. The radio station functions as both constraint and tool. Environmental details like "generator exhaust braided with moonlight" enhance atmosphere while advancing action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear escalation as the tricksters adapt their frequency, forcing Lyra to abandon certainty and embrace chaos. The stake (preventing violence through interference) drives every beat. Cost is visible in the town's bewildered awakening and Lyra's physical exhaustion, though the resolution feels somewhat neat for the scale of the threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of interference as potential love, avoiding explicit moralizing. The concept of cosmic tricksters feeding on "planetary noise" resonates with real-world manipulation. Minor deduction for the slightly too-tidy final line that edges toward stating the theme directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with scientific precision ("37 hertz, the threshold where matter feels rather than hears") and lyrical compression. POV remains stable with Lyra throughout. The perceptual signature is consistent, showing her technical expertise filtered through exhausted determination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong prose with varied rhythm and high information density. Lines like "adversaries lowered signs, exchanged the bewildered eye-contact of sleepwalkers waking in each other's bedrooms" do multiple jobs efficiently. Minor deductions for occasional overwrought metaphors ("ethereal grit made visible") and some repetitive phrasing around the cosmic elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise of cosmic tricksters manipulating social division through subsonic frequencies offers a fresh angle on contemporary polarization. The specific technical details and astronomical charts ground the fantastical elements. However, the resolution mechanism feels somewhat convenient and the tricksters remain abstract rather than fully realized.</comment>
