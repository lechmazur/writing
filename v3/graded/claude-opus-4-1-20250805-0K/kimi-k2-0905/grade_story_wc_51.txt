I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern and density toward a resonant reconfiguration where the weaver's confession transforms the space and releases both personal and communal burden.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The weaver's internal contradiction between collecting others' burdens while carrying her own unspoken grief creates genuine tension. Her confession about her sister emerges naturally from established pressure, not therapeutic insight. The final transformation where she leaves carrying "only the memory of their weight" shows meaningful change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the weaver's confession transforms the grotto and releases the valley's pressure. The accumulative structure coheres through recursive imagery (fractal patterns, bronze reflections, burden-threads). Cost is visible in the blood drop and the "hollow where her own burden had been." Who/where/when anchored clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bronze grotto functions as more than setting—its "shingled hush" and recursive geometry actively constrain the weaver's escape until her confession. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("whalebone reverie," "moth wings"). The environment physically transforms in response to character action, with the walls "peeling back like petals."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from collecting others' burdens to risking eternal entrapment when the lamp sputters. The weaver's agency drives the resolution through her choice to confess. The tightening occurs when "the grotto resisted, tightening its shingled hush," forcing her pivotal decision with clear cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox that one must surrender personal burden to bear collective weight. The sister's face appearing "not accusatory but forgiving" reweights the entire collection process. The final image of the lamp left behind as "a small sun to guide whoever next descended" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent mythic-poetic register with controlled vocabulary ("calcifying," "auric," "obsidian"). Perceptual signature strong in how the weaver experiences the grotto's resistance as physical pressure. Some elevated diction ("boundary-lessly trapped") occasionally strains but serves the otherworldly tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The confession calcified into a sheet heavier than all the others"). Some ornamental phrases like "whalebone reverie" and occasional register elevation, but momentum maintains through varied sentence structures. The compound modifier "boundary-lessly" reads awkwardly but doesn't obscure meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fractal weaver concept freshly combines mathematical patterns with emotional burden in an organic way. The specific detail of leaving one's burden to collect others' transforms a potential abstraction into concrete dramatic irony. The bronze grotto as recursive trap that responds to confession shows imaginative world-building.</comment>
