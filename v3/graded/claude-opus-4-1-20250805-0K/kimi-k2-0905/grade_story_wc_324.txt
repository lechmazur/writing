<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's persistent curiosity drives concrete micro-choices under pressure (following pulses, crossing wires, photographing evidence), with embodied tension in the confrontation with Hask. The final renunciation of the hearing aid carries visible cost as she chooses silence after fulfilling her duty. Minor deduction for some diagnostic clarity in emotional processing ("feeling the same illicit thrill").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear causal lens with because/therefore linkage from hearing Lila's voice through exposing Hask's theft, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira's action restores posthumous justice with visible cost (Hask's collapse, Mira's exhaustion). The hearing aid's death and Mira's dreamless sleep embody the price of channeling the dead. Slight dock for convenient timing of Hask's arrival.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The conservatory's decay mirrors institutional abandonment, with concrete details like "vines had learned to mimic heart valves" and "decades of condensation had recorded heartbeats in rust" constraining movement and charging atmosphere. The mist functions as both obscuring element and medium for spectral manifestation at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from logging a final cluster to exposing decades-old fraud, with Mira's discovery forcing a confrontation where she risks both evidence and personal safety at the koi pond's edge. The cost is legible in Hask's collapse under "the sudden gravity of voices he could no longer silence."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action as "incidental heroism" transforms from Lila's unrecognized blood drive coordination to Mira's deliberate choice to expose truth despite risk. The final image of Mira as one tracer "persistently curious enough to listen" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the opening's abandoned program.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled psychic distance and clean focalization throughout, using scientific/medical lexicon ("fibrillation," "emulsion") appropriate to Mira's role. The prose modulates effectively under pressure, tightening during confrontation. Minor dock for occasional register elevation ("sudden gravity of voices").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied sentence structures, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("swallowed sound the way old velvet swallows light"). Minor template cadence in middle section transitions. The final line effectively recharges the opening without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story and institutional corruption through the specific mechanism of heart-trace technology and posthumous voice protection. The concept of tracing cardiac histories for insurance exploitation offers genuine novelty, though execution occasionally relies on familiar paranormal beats.</comment>
