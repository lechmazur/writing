<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's backwards walking and her choice between exile and erasure create genuine internal conflict with embodied specificity. The mentor-student dynamic generates meaningful pressure through absence and example. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "resilience" and "defiance" that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Lira's cataloguing fragments building toward her choice to mentor the child while preserving memory. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she enables the child's future return without forgetting, with cost visible in her permanent exile. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "reversible exile" mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forgotten library with its warped doorway, imprisoned shadow, and breathing shelves creates a vivid micro-setting that constrains choices. The teacup's geometry directly shapes Lira's decision, and the shard-mirrors actively scatter light throughout. The swing's ghost adds textural depth that pays off in the child's arrival.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving memory versus returning home—establishes early and tightens when the tea leaves reveal the price of saving the library. Lira's choice to mentor the child rather than reverse her exile shows clear agency with visible cost. The escalation through discovery of the mentor's name and the child's arrival creates meaningful pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of resilience through backwards movement and memory preservation emerges organically from events. The recurring shadow, teacup ritual, and shard-mirrors accumulate meaning without explicit moralizing. The final line "Resilience is walking backwards until the path agrees to follow you" crystallizes the theme through earned metaphor rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("shard-mirror archivist," "combative tenderness"). Some effective compression and metaphor ("smiled the way a blade smiles when it chooses not to cut"). Minor deductions for occasional register elevation that strains the POV and some repetitive constructions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Notable issues include repetitive "walked backwards" constructions, some abstract phrasing ("quiet defiance," "reversible exile"), and occasional overwrought metaphors. The filter-verb density in places ("felt the name burrow," "felt like an empty playground") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of reversible exile with memory erasure as price offers a fresh angle on choice and sacrifice. The backwards-walking response to nervousness and the mentor-through-absence approach show genuine originality. The synthesis of fragments, mirrors, and tea-leaf geometry creates a cohesive imaginative world.</comment>
