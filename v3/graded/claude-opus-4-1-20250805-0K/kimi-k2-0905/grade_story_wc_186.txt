I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The custodian's retrocognitive gift creates genuine internal tension between knowing the past and changing the future, with her final transformation into "the new prism" earning its resonance through accumulated cost. The child skeleton moment delivers visceral embodiment of loss. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "coincidences have meaning" motivation that could use more grounded specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the custodian becoming "the new prism" reweights all prior shard-gathering as purposeful refraction rather than mere repair. The journey structure (pavilion→desert→return) provides clear causality with the missing shard driving action. Cost is legible in "counting every mistake of the world" and the generational pattern of loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion's sonic qualities ("hum the single note they still knew: a moan between mourning and morning") effectively constrains perception and creates atmosphere. Post-apocalyptic details like "ringed husks of shopping malls where vines spelled unreadable names" ground the journey. The desert setting with Joshua tree provides stark contrast. Slight deduction for some abstract passages about star navigation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to generational pattern as the custodian discovers her mother's path mirrors her own. The shard of hush discovery beneath the child's skeleton creates genuine cost—"the desert fell mute." The lamp's ignition resolving into "rose glow" rather than warning light effectively reframes success. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The central theme of pattern and intention ("not accidents but refractions of one intention") emerges organically through the prism metaphor without stating a moral. The final image of the custodian as "the new prism...promising whoever might see the rose glow that patterns exist" offers a non-literal answer to whether coincidences have meaning. Strong integration of light/refraction imagery throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("thistle-blown hope," "horizon's ink") maintains consistency. Some elevated diction occasionally strains POV credibility ("retrocognitively blessed," "calcification") but serves the mythic tone. The perceptual signature of touching shards and tasting "every unspoken wish" creates unique focalization. Minor register drift in places.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments of compression ("footprints later erased by salt wind") but several instances of abstract phrasing weaken immediacy: "coincidences have meaning," "patterns exist," "no fall is final." The prose occasionally tells what could be shown through image. Some template repetition in "She [verb]" constructions. Information density varies; strongest in sensory passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The retrocognitive gift allowing the custodian to experience objects' histories offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic reconstruction. The concept of becoming "the new prism" rather than simply fixing the old one shows genuine transformation of the lighthouse keeper trope. The generational pattern adds depth beyond surface novelty.</comment>
