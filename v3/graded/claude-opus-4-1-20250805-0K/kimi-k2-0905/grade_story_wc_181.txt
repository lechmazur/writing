<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's bewilderment and pursuit of forbidden knowledge drive consistent choices through the orchard's transformations, with embodied reactions (vomiting, stomach lurching) grounding abstract concepts. The character's progression from curator to "both book and librarian" shows genuine transformation with cost (erased kindnesses). However, some philosophical breakthroughs feel unearned ("the cameo was not blank but waiting"), and the rapid assimilation of paradoxical truths lacks sufficient struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Conceptual Repricing through "The curator is the catalog" revelation, with visible cost in erased memories returning as footnotes. The nonlinear inheritance concept coheres through consistent logic of memories arriving out of sequence. Orientation anchors (asteroid K-77, Dr. Mara Quell) establish early, though the rapid scene shifts between orchard/bathroom/mirror-corridor strain spatial coherence without fully breaking it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The astral orchard functions as both setting and mechanism, with galaxy-fruits and black-hole seeds constraining Mara's choices through their cost system. Specific sensory details (starlight petals chiming like tuning forks, phosphorescent moss) create vivid micro-settings. The bathroom pod's telepathy-dampening property and plumbing-as-xylem connection make space actively shape the protagonist's options and revelations.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from sanity versus knowledge to the erasure of Mara's past deeds, with each galaxy-fruit plucked extracting specific cost. The command to "pursue forbidden knowledge or forfeit sanity page by page" establishes clear pressure that tightens through the bathroom confrontation. The final merger with the page represents earned transformation, though the resolution's completeness slightly deflates terminal pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of nonlinear inheritance as "simply complicated love arriving early" emerges through concrete imagery rather than statement. The pistachio shell's transformation from blank waiting to germinating seed, and the orchard as family inheritance, create resonant metaphors for knowledge transmission. The final line about "those who remember to forget" offers genuine paradox without tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary elevation with distinctive phrasing ("brightened disquiet," "existential steam") that suits the philosophical premise. Some passages achieve genuine poetry ("every fruit was a miniature galaxy and every seed a black hole softly humming lullabies"). However, register occasionally drifts toward abstract philosophizing that exceeds Mara's established lexicon, particularly in breakthroughs that feel more authorial than character-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong imagery and conceptual density, with sentences often doing multiple jobs (description/theme/emotion). However, abstract philosophical passages create momentum drag ("nonlinear inheritance is simply complicated love arriving early"), and some metaphors strain coherence (the bathroom as both refuge and chrysalis). The final paragraph's expository summary ("Knowledge is not forbidden; it is inherited backwards") replaces scene pressure with direct thematic statement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of nonlinear inheritance receiving physical form through an astral orchard shows genuine originality, transforming time-travel tropes through botanical metaphor. The bathroom as philosophical breakthrough space subverts expectations effectively. The synthesis of curator/catalog and the image of memories as footnotes blooming in margins demonstrate fresh conceptual thinking that feels earned through the story's particular logic.</comment>
