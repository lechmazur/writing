<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's insomnia functions as both burden and gift, driving her artistic quest with embodied exhaustion ("eyes raw from three days without sleep"). Her transformation from viewing insomnia as curse to vigilance shows earned change through the exchange with the old woman, though internal contradiction could be sharper in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based closure where Mara's first sleep in months constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration, costing her vigilant witness role. The shell spirals, rain trails, and water imagery accumulate to reweight meaning, though the orientation slightly delays (monastery context emerges gradually).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tidal island and monastery function as active constraints—the causeway's tidal window limits access, the rain trails guide movement, and the half-drowned monastery embodies the water wars' transformation. The amber brooch's warmth responding to shell patterns makes even small objects environmentally active.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through Mara's progression from seeking a memory-for-supplies exchange to discovering pattern recognition as the true currency. The painting-for-water trade crystallizes this shift with visible cost (her exhausted labor for untainted water), though mid-story pressure could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete exchange of fragment-for-painting and water-for-meaning, avoiding abstraction. The final image of Mara sleeping while dreaming of pre-human spirals offers a non-literal answer about survival requiring both witness and rest, with the water wars revealing rather than ending patterns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains wry earnestness through paradoxes like "defeated army" tides and "haggard awe," with consistent POV control. Some figurative density in places ("breathing thing, half-earth, half-sea") suits the painter's perception but occasionally tips toward overwriting without full payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("ribboned down the basalt causeway stones") with good variation, though some passages edge toward purple ("fantastic shapes," "microscopic life that would evolve"). The paraphrase about meaning being "threshed" appears three times, creating minor redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The memory-for-supplies exchange market transforms into pattern recognition as currency, offering fresh inflection on post-apocalyptic barter. The water wars causing seas to "forget their ancient rhythms" and the monastery's tidal transformation show imaginative world-building, though some elements feel familiar.</comment>
