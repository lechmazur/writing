<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—stealing unlearned lessons to prevent war—with concrete embodied choices like tearing diary pages for navigation and trading years of life. The "carefully resourceful" trait manifests through specific problem-solving beats. Loses points for some diagnostic language ("renegotiation," "rescue missions") and the time traveler remains somewhat functional rather than applying pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara releasing absences into the world, with visible cost (trading a year of her life). The accumulative/textural lens holds through botanical imagery and linguistic puzzles building toward the final seed-planting. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and causality tracks cleanly. Docked for the somewhat mechanical resolution of the library puzzle and the explain-y historians coda.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore-mountain setting actively constrains choices through living root-walls, stairs of crumbling adjectives, and spatial puzzles between "astronomy and etiquette." The botanical diary functions as micro-setting, its ink-flowers and seeds enabling navigation and unlocking doors. Environment directly shapes the rescue through linguistic geography. Minor deduction for occasional over-description ("petrified paper desk").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—acquiring unlearned lessons to prevent war—is signaled early and faces meaningful escalation when Elara must sacrifice a year of life to unlock the library. Agency drives the resolution through her choice to trade lifespan for access. However, the time traveler's predicament lacks urgency and the external pressure could be stronger; the mountain mostly presents puzzles rather than active opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of "unlearned lessons" and gaps/absences speaking louder than presence, culminating in Elara releasing these absences as "second thoughts" into cities. The botanical diary's seed-to-language transformation reinforces themes of growth and hidden knowledge. Slight deduction for the over-explicit historians paragraph explaining thematic impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice with inventive language ("crystal paragraph," "glossary staircase") and consistent POV control. The perceptual signature—experiencing the mountain through linguistic and botanical filters—remains character-specific throughout. Prose modulates effectively during the rescue sequence. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("carefully resourceful" feels prompt-inserted) and some repetitive constructions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with inventive imagery and good momentum through the rescue sequence. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, several template patterns appear: "she [verb], [verb]ing" constructions, repetitive "Elara [action]" openings, and the phrase "carefully resourceful" reads as scaffold. The historians paragraph disrupts momentum with exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of linguistic magic, botanical transformation, and time-debt creates genuine originality—books as living architecture, words as seeds, years as currency. The "library of unlearned lessons" concept and its execution through absence-planting offers a fresh angle on knowledge preservation. Risk-taking through dense metaphorical language mostly succeeds. Slight deduction for safety in the neat resolution.</comment>
