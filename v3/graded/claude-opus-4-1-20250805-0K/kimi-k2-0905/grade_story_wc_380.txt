<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miren's motivation to recover deleted memories drives consistent action through the whale's gravity pockets to the salt chamber's memory extraction. The internal conflict between loss and recovery manifests concretely through her handling of the pressed wildflowers and their transformation. The ending's choice to release memories into the city shows earned renunciation with visible cost—she cannot keep what she sought but transforms loss into communal ballast.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through gravity distortions, salt crystals, and memory fragments toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Miren releases the memories she cannot hold. The closure lands with felt cost as "laughter settles into her bones, not as loss, but as ballast." The pattern of memory-as-substance pays off when dispersed memories enter others' dreams and sensations.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The gravity pockets constrain movement ("pulled her steps into strange arcs") and the salt chamber's crystals enable memory extraction through their light-bending properties. Setting details like "the whale's shadow—not its physical form, but the memory of its passage, preserved in salt" directly shape how Miren accesses the deleted memories. The final image of "pockets of gravity fluctuating mysteriously beneath her feet" charges the transformed world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from tracking the whale to entering its gravity field to the revelation that memories orbit but cannot be grasped, forcing Miren's choice to release rather than possess. The cost manifests when "her fingers passed through, leaving only the residue of gleaming silence"—she achieves access but not ownership. The final dispersal shows agency through renunciation with clear trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete mechanics of deletion/recovery: "deleted memories do not vanish; they sink, like whale bones, into places where the world's rules grow thin." The ending's dispersal of memories into strangers' dreams offers a non-literal answer about how loss transforms into collective inheritance. Subtext operates through images like the lantern circles holding "the silhouette of her sister waving from a distance that could not be measured."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature tracks impossible physics ("her boots sank ankle-deep into the wooden planks without leaving a mark") and synesthetic detail ("gleaming silence," "tasted of iron and forgetting"). Voice maintains poetic compression without sacrificing clarity, modulating from observational distance to intimate sensation when memories emerge. The prose rhythm accelerates during the memory extraction then slows for the meditative ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The flowers, brittle and colorless, began to absorb the ambient light, their petals regaining the bruised purple of dusk" advances plot while establishing the transformation mechanism. Some figurative density in peak beats ("memories emerged like minnows") but serves the accumulative pattern. Clean propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of gravity pockets as memory-containers and the salt chamber as extraction site creates a fresh physics for grief and recovery. The specific synthesis of deletion-as-sinking and memories-as-dispersible substance feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the non-causal mechanics and lyric structure heightens the emotional stakes while maintaining clarity through concrete imagery.</comment>
