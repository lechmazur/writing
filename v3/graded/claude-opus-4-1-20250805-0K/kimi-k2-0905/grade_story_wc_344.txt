I'll evaluate this story under a **Causal lens** - the narrative follows clear because/therefore linkages as Rowan discovers the hall's true nature and repairs his key to unlock both door and personal healing.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied characterization with Rowan's irregular heartbeat tied to mentor's loss, and the pivotal realization about the mirrors storing "better versions" drives meaningful change. The final choice to step through despite the door locking behind him shows genuine cost. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("doubt hissed like thawing steel") rather than fully embodied reaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear causal progression from prophecy → journey → discovery → transformation with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Rowan accepts permanent exile to complete his healing. The cost is explicit: "the door locked itself with a click" and "the doorway back had vanished." Orientation anchors (locksmith, frozen library, hall of mirrors) establish by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen library and hall of mirrors directly constrain and enable the central action - the mirrors' ability to heal the broken key is essential to plot resolution. Vivid sensory detail ("boots squealing on crystal floors," "breath unfurled as silver gauze") creates atmosphere while the setting's rules drive the solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clear escalation from failed attempts with gears → discovery of mirrors' true nature → healing the key → irreversible choice to enter. The stakes (learning "rhythm of repair" to heal his grief) tighten when he realizes entry means no return. Cost is visible in the permanent separation from his world.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of repair/forgiveness emerges organically through the mechanics of locks, keys, and time. The insight "to mend the world you must first forgive the gear that slipped" resonates without preaching, earned through concrete action. The final image of overlapping clock ticks promises future healing work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and distinctive voice ("lunar-eclipse locksmith," "driftwood nostalgia"). Some register elevation in places ("hauntingly bright blades") fits the lyrical tone but occasionally strains. The perceptual signature of a craftsman noticing mechanical details throughout maintains character-specific focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery, though "hauntingly bright" appears three times creating mild repetition. Some dense figurative sections ("frost racing along the shank until the crack sealed") work well. Minor issues with a few abstract constructions ("Understanding settled like fresh snow") and one instance of telling what could be shown.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clockwork repair with emotional healing through the inventive "hall of mirrors showing better versions" concept. The lunar-eclipse locksmith profession and frozen library setting avoid generic fantasy tropes. The resolution through accepting permanent transformation rather than simple return shows commitment to premise.</comment>
