<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miren's internal contradiction between her creed of trust and the reality of failure drives genuine character pressure, with embodied grief in handling the tail tips and her methodical dismantling of identity markers. The shift from expert to questioner lands with visible cost in the released chameleon and abandoned cage. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("fragile convictions crack like thin ice") and the slightly over-articulated ending reflection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure as Miren transforms from certainty to "tenderly cracked open," with visible cost in the dead chameleons and shed identity. The accumulative lens holds as she methodically strips away layers of false expertise. Deduction for mild orientation delay (the con's exact nature emerges slowly) and some causality softness in how quickly she formulates her reconstruction method.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The misty workshop atmosphere and physical details (cedar table, iron stove, refrigerated drawer) ground the action effectively, with the chameleon's color shifts providing vivid sensory anchoring. The tail tips constrain her memorial choice and the field setting enables release. Some generic descriptors ("shimmering stillness," "silver darkness") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional failure through identity crisis to earned humility, with each shed layer (ring, braid, lecture notes) foreclosing her former expert identity. The cost is legible in the dead chameleons and her final acceptance of "doubt." The single meaningful deepening from betrayal to self-reckoning satisfies the length requirements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of dismantling false expertise and the tail-tip memorial, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of Aster melting into darkness while Miren accepts being "richer in doubt" resonantly reweights the opening certainty. Slight deduction for the marginally over-explicit "conviction still alive, now tenderly cracked open."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("tiny paintbrush dipped in moonlight"). Voice modulates appropriately from clinical observation to raw vulnerability. Some repetitive phrasing ("quietly vivid" appears twice as prompted element) and occasional register elevation ("immaculate reputation that had let the con flourish") slightly reduce distinctiveness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum through varied sentence structure and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is solid with most lines advancing character or atmosphere. Deductions for repetitive constructions ("she [verb]" patterns), some abstract metaphors ("twin-born motivation"), and occasional overwriting in descriptive passages ("star-color, quietly vivid against the universe").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The specific detail of creating a memorial from victim's tail tips and inscribing vows on cedar shows genuine originality within the wildlife handler premise. The transformation from expertise to humility through physical dismantling avoids cliché. Limited by somewhat predictable arc of disillusionment-to-renewal without surprising synthesis.</comment>
