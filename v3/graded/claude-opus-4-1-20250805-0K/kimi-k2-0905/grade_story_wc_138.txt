grade_story_wc_138.txt
I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Inferred Drive Lens:** Causal - the story operates through clear because/therefore linkages as Vey follows the amulet fragment, which leads to the technicians, which enables the mutual bargain, culminating in Vey's passage through the door.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vey's immortal boredom motivates the pursuit of the amulet and acceptance of dissolution. The technicians' mutiny provides credible pressure through their desperation for freedom. Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("centuries cracking like ice") but the final choice to proceed into darkness earns its cost through established causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change when Vey chooses to "proceed" into unmarked darkness, paying the ultimate cost of his immortality. The causal chain from amulet discovery to mutual bargain to threshold crossing is clean. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (prismatic escondite, immortal Vey, solar storm context).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite's dimensional anchors constrain the technicians' escape plan and enable the final door's appearance. Solar storm timing creates urgency. The amulet fragment physically compels movement through "polar hunger," though some descriptions lean ornamental ("colors singing in hushed thunder").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from boredom to the discovery of a path beyond immortality. The technicians' mutiny creates external pressure that converges with Vey's internal need. The bargain scene crystallizes competing desires with clear cost: Vey's dissolution enables their freedom.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the exploration of endings and what lies "after goodbye." The amulet's curse binding the technician leader to "restless pilgrimage" resonates with Vey's prior endless wandering. Some thematic statements edge toward explicit ("I am already exiled in endless time") but the final image of choosing the unknown over memory carries weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation appropriate to immortal perspective. "The hush between thunder and echo" and "Möbius sigh" create distinctive texture. Dialogue remains minimal but effective ("What happens after goodbye?"). Some register drift in peak moments but POV control holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and rhythmic modulation. Information density is high throughout. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("vermilion," "auroras in eyes") and some template phrasing around the technicians' whispers, but no loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of an immortal choosing dissolution through a cursed amulet's guidance offers fresh perspective on the eternal life trope. The mutual bargain between Vey and the technicians creates non-obvious synthesis. The prismatic escondite as living architecture with memory adds originality.</comment>
