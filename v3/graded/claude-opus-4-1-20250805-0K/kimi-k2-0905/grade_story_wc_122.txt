<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's grief-numbed state creates contradictory impulses—seeking what she cannot hear to heal what she cannot feel—with the final drum-heart connection earned through accumulated sensory work. The backwards lullaby peeling "translucent layers from the numb cocoon" embodies emotion concretely while avoiding diagnostic language.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's shift from numbness to welcomed grief, with visible cost in the tears and the acceptance of pain as "livable." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward the final drum-heartbeat image that reweights silence from vacant to resonant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cavern's materials (cedar, goatskin, brass phonograph) constrain and enable Mara's journey, with the pedal lathe and workbench providing concrete tools for transformation. The setting doesn't quite reach 9+ because while vivid and functional, the environment could have more directly shaped the critical turning moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from seeking abstract relief to accepting concrete grief, with the backwards lullaby creating a meaningful turn that "peeled a translucent layer" from numbness. The cost is felt through tears and the raw pain Mara welcomes, though escalation could be sharper through the middle section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The final image of Mara pressing drum to heart "reversing nothing, simply living" offers a non-literal answer to the numbness/feeling question without moralizing. The filament metaphor threads through needle, sound, and silence, reweighting hush from empty to resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Mara's synesthetic experience of sound as vibration—"shy knock" through ankles, melody "through the bones." The lyrical register maintains consistency even under emotional pressure, with purposeful compression serving the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines like "silver as tin" and "drumroll building under ribs" doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition of "hush" and some template phrasing ("She placed...then on") create slight drag but don't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The deaf music teacher experiencing sound through vibration offers a fresh angle on grief processing, though the workshop-as-healing-space feels somewhat familiar. The backwards music unwinding memory shows originality, elevated by specific sensory work throughout.</comment>
