<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation emerges through mythic action rather than psychological interiority, with her "geas soldered to her laughter" providing external compulsion rather than internal contradiction. The character operates more as archetypal herald than individuated consciousness, though her three distinct laughs do create progression toward accepting her role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through green fire, black flame, and sail imagery building toward transformation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lirael becomes "reader" rather than herald, with cost visible in star erasure and the lighthouse's dissolution. The mythic register and symbolic density occasionally obscure concrete causality, particularly in the middle third where "shadow drinks light" operates more as incantation than mechanism.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and transforming seascape create vivid, constraining environment—the lens turning "of its own accord," the lighthouse lifting from foundation, stars rearranging into wick. Setting actively shapes action through "total internal reflection" folding starlight into green fire corridors. Minor deduction for some abstract passages ("ocean of post-newsprint silence") that drift from embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on steering night toward dawn through shadow manipulation, with pressure building through the wick's consumption and each laugh's escalating cost. The transformation from herald to reader provides meaningful deepening, though agency remains partially external through the geas rather than arising from internal conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the death of print/birth of light-stories, with the lighthouse journey from fixed beacon to mobile vessel enacting transformation rather than stating it. The final image of Lirael as "portable lighthouse" with shadows "shining through her" offers resonant non-literal answer to renewal through destruction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent mythic-lyric register with controlled compression ("curled into ash," "cradled like a chilled vein"). However, elevated diction occasionally drifts into opacity ("geas soldered to her laughter centuries before paper ever screamed") without sufficient grounding. The sustained metaphorical density, while ambitious, sometimes obscures rather than illuminates the narrative line.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("starlight entered the thick crystal") but suffers from density overload where nearly every sentence carries figurative weight without variation. Mixed metaphors appear ("lighthouse touched that canvas and dissolved, leaving Lirael barefoot on dew") and abstract constructions proliferate ("tomorrow in a language no press had yet polluted"). The relentless metaphorical pressure creates opacity rather than resonance in several passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of lighthouse-as-vessel navigating night sea while transforming shadow into dawn offers genuine originality. The synthesis of print media death with light-based rebirth, executed through physical transformation rather than metaphor alone, demonstrates risk-taking that mostly succeeds despite occasional opacity.</comment>
