<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lark's monthly molting creates a vivid embodied transformation with skin splitting and the old self peeling away like wet paper—a concrete physical manifestation of internal change. The contradiction between wanderer and lantern-bearer drives the final choice, and Marin's complementary arc from guard to co-conspirator deepens the crucible. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("blooming resistance," "co-conspirator of light") in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the library's transformation from ruin to "sovereign gap" and Lark/Marin becoming co-conspirators, with visible cost in burning past selves and risking their positions. The accumulative lens holds as imagery (moon, rust, wings) builds toward the final vision of patrons streaming out with paper wings. Slight dock for the somewhat convenient resolution with Rourke's acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rusted library breathes as setting—"exhales iron dust," buckled roof with punctured ceiling letting moonlight through, creating a liminal space between prison and freedom. Objects constrain and enable: the coffee tin's false bottom, hollowed dictionaries hiding paper cranes, the potbellied stove consuming old selves. The desert setting and moon's movement mark time's passage and charge the cyclical transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes crystallize around preserving the library as sanctuary versus its conversion to solitary pods, with Lark and Marin risking exposure to rebuild it as "sovereign gap." The sergeant's arrival creates genuine pressure, though his quick acceptance slightly deflates tension. Cost is visible in burning past selves and the risk they take, with the final image of gates cracking open showing earned transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of recycling skins while bones remain—transformation requires both destruction and preservation. The paper cranes with micro-poems lodged in dictionaries embody resistance as patient, hidden cultivation. "Beauty from anarchy" gains meaning through their collaborative rebuilding, not as abstract principle but lived practice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lark's voice carries distinctive texture—"penny poet," skin that "molts," words arriving "jagged"—with consistent lyric compression. Dialogue feels natural ("I only read the spine translations"/"Then you're tasting the bones, not the marrow") with clear subtext about surface versus depth. Some register elevation in peak moments ("jurisdiction-less," "sovereign gap") slightly strains the vagrant poet's lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong imagery throughout—skin splitting like wet paper, flames blooming green, cranes rustling in paper nests. Information density high with most lines carrying multiple functions. Deductions for repetitive "co-conspirator" phrasing, some template structures ("Lark feels...Marin slips...He dips"), and occasional register drift ("inventoried the contraband literature").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The monthly molting as physical manifestation of reinvention offers fresh angle on transformation—not metaphorical but literal shedding. The prison library as liminal space for beauty-making subverts expected institutional dynamics. Paper cranes with micro-poems hidden in dictionaries creates specific, memorable resistance imagery that feels inevitable within this world's logic.</comment>
