<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to understand night-blooming flowers drives consistent choices through painting cathedral glass and waiting with moonflowers, though internal contradiction remains largely abstract. The "quietly driven" attribute manifests through sustained artistic pursuit across seasons. Her final understanding that "flowers bloom at night because the dark remembers what the day forgets" represents earned insight, but lacks embodied emotional cost at the crucial moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as seasonal progression and artistic discovery build toward Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora understands darkness as essential to bloom. The pavilion transforms from arrival space to living artwork, with cost visible in "old grief she had never painted." Orientation anchors clearly (artist, pavilion, autumn), though the extended coda after Liora's departure dilutes closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The amber pavilion constrains artistic choices—its "copper ribs" hold postcards, glass panes become Liora's canvas, moonflowers grow from its base. Sensory detail excels: "frost settle on her eyelashes," "earth so dark it looked wet," moonflower perfume "tasted like violet ink." The pavilion functions as both workspace and eventual artwork, with seasonal changes driving discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on artistic understanding rather than external conflict, with pressure building through seasonal patience and the 1912 postcard's challenge to "reckon with the shadow." The moonflowers' arrival provides meaningful deepening as Liora realizes "the answer had never been about light but about absence." Cost appears in leaving the completed work behind, though agency remains contemplative rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of darkness/light, with the pavilion's painted glass becoming "scripture of shadows." The question "what in you opens only when no one is looking?" resonates without moralizing. Subtext operates through images—moonflowers as "small fists refusing daylight," branches arranged as rose windows—though the extended epilogue explaining seed-carrying visitors weakens the earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm: "She stood inside her own mural, surrounded by glass that now held both the garden's reflection and its inverse." POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature in how Liora sees art in natural forms. Some register elevation occurs ("umbral tenderness") but serves the meditative tone rather than disrupting it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty—"moonlight like frozen breath," "snow retreated inch by inch"—with strong information density in descriptive passages. However, abstract formulations like "the dawning hush that waits just beyond winter's last breath" and repetitive "quietly driven" create occasional opacity. The unfinished final sentence appears intentional but reads as artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of art-making with natural cycles offers fresh perspective on creative process, particularly painting on pavilion glass to create negative/positive space inversions. The postcard's self-mailing adds conceptual interest. However, the extended metaphysical explanation and visitor epilogue retreat toward safer literary territory rather than maintaining the risk of the core image.</comment>
