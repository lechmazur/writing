<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysira's motivation to preserve forbidden memory through dance is clear and intensifies through embodied detail ("hips forecasting surf that no longer officially existed"). The choice between propaganda performance and exile shows consistent character traits, though the internal struggle could be more contradictory in scene rather than summarized. Her final transformation into "forbidden memory" itself is earned through prior physical and emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lysira becomes the forbidden memory itself, paying with her physical form ("skin sang verses only the tide could read"). The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and maintains it through closure. Cost is visible in the moonstone dust burning out and her transformation, though the nostalgia ban worldbuilding could anchor more concretely earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The twilight garden setting actively constrains choices (no lantern needed, specific dance space, eastern gate exit) and the moonstone dust functions as micro-setting that enables the transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("air tasted of obsidian grace"), though some metaphorical density ("smooth and cutting") occasionally obscures physical reality. The garden's transformation into "a dancer mid-leap" in stars charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving forbidden memory against erasure—escalates from internal dance to physical inscription to complete transformation. Agency drives the progression through Lysira's dance choices, though the middle section's verse-writing lacks some concrete resistance or complication. The cost accumulates visibly (moonstone burning, skin transforming) but could benefit from more external pressure or obstacle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the physical act of memory preservation via body-as-text, avoiding direct statement. The final image of footprints "spiraling into absence" and skin that "sang verses only the tide could read" offers resonant non-literal answer to memory's persistence. Subtext operates through dance as resistance and the body as archive, though occasional phrases like "darker, kinder firmament" edge toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled perceptual signature ("gaps: the hush between cricket chords, the black river between stars"). Purposeful compression and patterned elision serve the accumulative design. Some register elevation in peak moments ("obsidian grace cutting her face into a crescent moon") fits the heightened state, though phrases like "spontaneously anchored" feel slightly forced.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, but figurative density in high-pressure beats occasionally obscures action ("dust lifted, orbiting her wrists like obedient minnows"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("exile had not removed her from the world; it had removed the world from inside her"). Information density is high but the metaphorical layering sometimes reduces clarity of physical action during the transformation sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of body-as-forbidden-text offers fresh angle on memory resistance narratives. Specific synthesis of dance, celestial imagery, and inscription creates memorable perspective. The transformation from dancer to living verse feels earned through prior particulars, though some elements (moonstone dust, nostalgia ban) lean slightly toward familiar dystopian tropes without full transformation.</comment>
