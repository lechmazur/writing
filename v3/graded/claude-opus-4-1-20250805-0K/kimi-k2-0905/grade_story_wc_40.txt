<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's reticent nature drives meaningful choices through active listening and testimony rather than passive observation. Her internal shift from cataloguing certainty to witnessing presence is earned through concrete sensory experiences with the crystal. The final choice to leave the crystal behind demonstrates clear agency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through sonic sequences that build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara becomes "the first thread in its new spine." The closure lands with conceptual cost—the end of written language transformed into oral memory. Who/where/when anchored clearly by paragraph two.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The library functions as active setting through fallen books, specific sections (biography, philosophy), and the reading room's architecture. Sensory detail effectively narrows from visual (dust motes, slanted light) to sonic (crystal's captured sounds). The pressed snowdrop constrains interpretation of growth as inward folding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest to decode patterns to becoming witness/participant in language's transformation. The crystal's warming intensification and Elara's shift from writing to speaking demonstrate meaningful deepening. Cost is legible in her leaving without the crystal, accepting testimony over possession.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the last word "zygote" reframes ending as beginning, the snowdrop teaches inward growth, and the crystal's testimony replacing written language. The final image of Elara as "first thread" resonantly answers the central question about preserving knowledge without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with controlled psychic distance and clear perceptual signature (fingers tracing spines, noticing suspended hush). Some filter verb accumulation ("she felt," "she realized") dulls immediacy in middle sections. Voice modulates effectively between scholarly observation and emotional recognition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, though some paraphrase loops appear ("She had not decoded the pattern to control it. She had done it to witness."). Template cadence in "She + verb" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Strong opening and closing lines anchor the piece effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-organism and crystal-as-memory-keeper avoids cliché through specific execution. The concept of language ending with the last dictionary while oral tradition begins shows originality. Some safety in emotional registers prevents higher scoring.</comment>
