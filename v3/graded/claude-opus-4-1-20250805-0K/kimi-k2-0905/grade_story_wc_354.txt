<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tutor's internal world is richly rendered through concrete details like his fingers worrying the stone's dent, but his transformation from exile to renewed purpose lacks sufficient dramatized struggle. The ending's shift to teaching "the world" feels unearned without showing who this crucial student is or what specific action he'll take.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through electromagnetic patterns and chess metaphors, but closure arrives as declaration rather than dramatized change. The final paragraphs assert transformation ("the game that had only just begun") without showing a concrete action or choice that would constitute a Decisive Change or earn the Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus effectively functions as both literal setting and metaphorical space where "reality's fabric stretched thin," constraining the tutor's reflection and enabling his realization. Sensory details like "three short hums, one long" create specificity that charges the atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While internal pressure accumulates through reflection on exile and loss, no external force tests the protagonist or forces a choice. The "correlated silence" remains abstract rather than presenting a concrete obstacle or opportunity that would demand action with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The chess-as-life metaphor develops consistently through "sacrificing what seemed most precious" and finding "beauty in the difficult," though it risks becoming overwrought. The theme earns resonance when showing how Lord Ashford applied chess lessons to expose corruption, but the ending's claim about teaching "the world" lacks grounded specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, though phrases like "hopeful melancholy" and "crystalline beauty" edge toward purple prose. The perceptual signature stays chess-focused throughout, creating coherent focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Repetitive structures proliferate: "At the magnetic nexus" appears four times, while conceptual loops like "beauty in difficulty/difficulty in beauty" and synonym chains ("exile/exiled/banishment") create drag. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions like "The tutor who had been exiled..." followed immediately by "As twilight surrendered..."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The fusion of chess instruction with electromagnetic phenomena offers an unusual angle, but the execution relies heavily on abstract meditation rather than concrete dramatization. The piece commits to its lyrical mode but doesn't fully transform the "exiled teacher finds new purpose" template through specific lived detail.</comment>
