<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong internal contradiction drives the piece—Juniper's face-blindness creates genuine stakes around recognition and memory. The blood-on-ribbon moment effectively embodies the cost of recovering suppressed trauma. However, the detective's instant emotional response feels unearned without prior establishment, and some interiority veers toward diagnostic ("empathy convulsed awake").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—Juniper's act of seeing transforms both her and the detective, with the portrait becoming a catalyst for broader change. The suppressed memory reveal recontextualizes the face-blindness as protective mechanism. Cost is visible in the blood ritual and the weight of confronting trauma. Minor orientation lag (quarry's significance emerges slowly) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The quarry as setting constrains choices effectively—its "jagged throat" and mist create atmospheric pressure that mirrors internal excavation. The ribbon's hair-and-silk weave provides crucial tactile specificity. However, the precinct hallway ending shifts to a more generic space without the same embodied detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Escalation follows an accumulative pattern as Juniper's ritual drawing builds toward the blood-on-ribbon revelation. The suppressed memory surfaces with genuine cost (self-harm, confronting trauma). However, the detective subplot and the broader city transformation feel tacked on rather than earned through the established pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the unifying opposites motif—synthetic/organic, blindness/sight, memory/erasure. The portrait as "evidence that doesn't burn" resonates without stating a moral. The quarry "exhaling" provides a strong non-literal answer to the trauma question, though the city-wide empathy awakening stretches credibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyrical register ("mist clung like guilt," "methodical bones"). Perceptual signature strong in art-making passages. However, occasional register drift into clinical language ("empathy convulsed awake," "Method required opposites") breaks voice consistency during emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery ("dove-gray light," "kerosene lamp's single eye"). Information density high in drawing sequence. However, some overwriting appears ("the furrowed hush of the quarry deepened"), and the final paragraphs contain mild redundancy about empathy awakening that could be compressed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Face-blind portrait artist is a fresh paradox that drives the story's core tension. The ribbon as human hair woven with synthetic silk is genuinely inventive. The trauma-as-protective-blindness reversal transforms a potential gimmick into earned psychological truth, though the city-wide transformation feels less grounded.</comment>
