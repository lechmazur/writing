I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor for a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric with precision.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cassidy's motivation crystallizes through concrete actions—pacing, rehearsing her equation, wielding the ink pot with calculated restraint. The memory-as-payment mechanic creates genuine internal conflict, though Rurik reads slightly thin as pure obstacle rather than complex opposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal drive with clear Decisive Change: Cassidy trades her mother's lullaby memory to force Rurik's hand, creating irreversible transformation for both. The ink pot's magic system is established early and pays off precisely at closure with visible cost—the lullaby vanishing "like a missing tooth."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prep room's formaldehyde-and-lilacs atmosphere establishes immediate sensory dissonance. Physical details like "eyelid weights and mouth-formers" create visceral specificity, though the dawn-as-bruise image feels slightly stock against the otherwise sharp detail work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal (reclaiming mother's memory) through confrontation (Rurik's arrival) to the ink's activation where both parties lose something precious. The "mathematics demands both sides lose" principle creates genuine cost, though Rurik's transformation could use one more beat of resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central equation of memory-for-justice without explicit moralizing. The concept of "fair trade" recontextualizes Julian's con artistry into Cassidy's ethical inversion, and the final image of mailing in blood resonates without explaining itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent noir-tinged precision with phrases like "refrigerated smile" and "granite policies into negotiable vapor." Dialogue carries appropriate formality between adversaries, though Cassidy's internal voice occasionally edges toward writerly rather than seventeen-year-old specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs—"she wasn't here to mourn—she was here to wait" establishes character and tension simultaneously. Some metaphor mixing ("granite liquefy") and the slightly overwrought "consensus reality" in Rurik's transformation create minor friction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The magic-ink-as-bureaucratic-override concept offers fresh angle on political asylum themes. While the memory-as-payment system creates authentic stakes, the setup relies somewhat on familiar con-artist-child and corrupt-ambassador archetypes without full transformation.</comment>
