I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern accumulation and sensory detail toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara's intervention restores balance to the houses.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's gift as a "creeping normality noticer" drives consistent, specific choices through orris root usage and fragment collection. The contradiction between her need to restore and acceptance of certain absences ("some absences, once named, need no filling") creates genuine complexity. Minor deduction for slightly abstract interiority at times ("inadvertently profound, like assembling a confession from pronouns").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's sanctification restores the houses' temporal balance, with visible cost in the "hush that keeps the world from shaking itself apart." The accumulative lens holds consistently through sensory detail and pattern-building. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the spiral discovery-to-restoration arc traces cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Environment actively constrains choices - the spiral floorboards guide Elara downward, the orris root enables vision through windows, and the bay setting pressures the houses' deterioration. Vivid sensory work: "sodium glow thinning against the dawn like memory against bone," "salt and cedar blood." The micro-setting of the compass becomes the story's pivot point.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of understanding/restoring displaced essence escalates through discovery of the houses' arrhythmia to the compass revelation. The tightening works through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens. Cost is felt in the houses' collective suffering and Elara's solitary burden, though agency could be slightly more decisive at the climactic moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of acknowledged absence and the conversation between homes and memory. The orris root functions beyond symbol, actively enabling perception. The ending's "hushed blaze of recognition" offers a non-literal answer about listening and presence without moralizing, though the final paragraph edges toward slight over-articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout - Elara perceives through scent, architectural pulse, and subtle drift others miss. Prose modulates beautifully with discovery: "The displaced objects drank the scent, the powder, the quiet." No dialogue needed or forced. Clean focalization maintains Elara's limited but gifted perspective without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong figurative control and rhythm variation, but occasional density issues: "inadvertently profound, like assembling a confession from pronouns" strains clarity. Some elevated diction ("sanctify," "covenant") slightly exceeds the established register. Information density generally high with multi-purpose sentences. Template cadence avoided, though a few filter constructions ("she felt," "she saw") could be stronger.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of "creeping normality noticer" offers a genuinely fresh angle on perception and change. Risk-taking in the lyrical, quiet approach to supernatural elements pays off through specificity. The synthesis of perfume, architecture, and temporal drift feels inevitable in hindsight. Elevated within band (+0.3) for the bold structural choice of resolution through whispered restoration rather than confrontation.</comment>
