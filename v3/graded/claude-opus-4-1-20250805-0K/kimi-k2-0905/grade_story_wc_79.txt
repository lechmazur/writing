<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cartographer's "quietly driven" nature manifests through persistent whistle-playing despite silence, her private obsession since childhood, and the crucial decision to alter the note that triggers the story's turn. Her choice to continue playing even as the city veers toward danger shows genuine internal conflict between duty to map and fear of answers.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural design with pattern languages building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the crack reveals the lost expedition and reweights the gate's purpose. The cost lands clearly: families separated by protective closure, the cartographer carrying "terrible chart" that will guide others toward this painful truth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The turtle-city setting brilliantly constrains every choice—from the gate's closure isolating them to Grand Akmon's tremor triggering action to the city's ability to change course toward watchers. Sensory details like "coral collar," "bone-white walls," and "salt-crusted abyss" create vivid specificity that shapes the stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through pattern recognition (tremor matching mother's log), the altered whistle note causing watchers to stir, and city's dangerous course change toward the abyss. The revelation reweights everything: the gate protected rather than imprisoned, forcing the cartographer to bear knowledge that will separate future families.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the terrible irony of protective isolation—the gate closed not from danger but love. The final image of the "terrible chart" that will guide wanderers toward separation resonates without moralizing, leaving readers with the complex cost of both knowledge and ignorance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with inventive compounds ("spiral-shell cartographer," "heat-shivered mirages") and consistent POV control. The perceptual signature—mapping patterns, feeling tremors through spine, tasting iron in harmonics—creates strong focalization though some phrases edge toward overwriting ("sunwashed dread" appears twice).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity, though "sunwashed dread" repetition and occasional density issues ("the city turned back toward the abyss, carrying her sunwashed dread and her new, terrible chart") slightly muddy momentum. Information density high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of a turtle-city with pattern-language navigation feels genuinely fresh, and the reversal—protection misread as imprisonment—transforms familiar lost expedition tropes. The specific synthesis of elements (shell-atlas chambers as maps, whistle frequencies as language) creates memorable originality.</comment>
