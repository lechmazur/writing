I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through alchemical transformations and symbolic layering toward a resonant reconfiguration where Aurelia transforms grief into teaching others about "luminous regret."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("tears added a twentieth" ounce, hands "trembled only once"). The protagonist's grief-driven choices feel earned through specific memory work. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "calibrated weight of understanding" that approaches therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear accumulative structure building through four "limits" toward Aurelia joining the search party with transformed understanding. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - she moves from isolation to teaching others about carrying loss. Cost is visible in the gold left behind and the weight she carries.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The foundry setting actively constrains and enables the alchemical work - rain on hot steel, abandoned molds providing rust, the anvil as workspace. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("iron-smelling dark," mercury pooling). The foundry's transformation mirrors Aurelia's journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the four explored limits, each deepening understanding of loss and redemption. The dominant stake (transforming grief into something bearable) tightens as each alchemical step reveals new dimensions. Minor issue: the final teaching resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the kintsugi metaphor - broken things becoming more valuable through visible repair. The ending reweights everything: "names are not chains but counterweights." No moralizing; meaning arises from concrete alchemical work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blending alchemical precision with poetic register ("gutters still ran silver," "factual-mystical"). POV control is exemplary - no head-hopping, consistent focalization. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the character's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm variation. However, some passages drift into overwriting ("luminous regret," multiple compound descriptors). Template cadence appears in the "She [verb]" pattern across several paragraphs. The closing paragraph is dense but maintains clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of alchemy, kintsugi, and grief work. The specific detail (nineteen ounces equals a newborn's breath) and the transformation of search party purpose show genuine innovation. Risk-taking in the conceptual density pays off.</comment>
