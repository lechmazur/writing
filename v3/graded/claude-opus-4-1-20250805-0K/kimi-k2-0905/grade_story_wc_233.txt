<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The queen's internal progression from disbelief to acceptance of the time-loop curse shows genuine psychological complexity, with embodied details like "silk slippers soaked with dew" and "frost flowered on her eyelashes." The final choice to become the voice that sends dreams backward carries visible cost—erasure of her living memory—though some passages drift toward abstract emotional states ("feeling the lacy menace dissolve into simple truth") rather than maintaining embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the queen's acceptance of the time loop, with clear cost (her erasure from memory) legible in "every mirror in the kingdom cracked at once." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through layered imagery building to the revelation that she must become her own warner. Orientation anchors arrive late (grotto location unclear until "ridge crest"), and the time-loop mechanics remain somewhat opaque, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto and bleeding starlight create vivid, constraining atmosphere that shapes the queen's choices—the "lacy menace" of thinning air forces her upward, the temperature inversion signals otherworldly rules. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from ridge base to grotto heart. The setting actively participates in closure through the ember stones flaring and mirrors cracking kingdom-wide.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (dreams) to kingdom-wide (collective forgetting), with the bleeding starlight as tangible pressure—"her subjects' memories of her reign dripping away." The final choice between descent (sealing fate) and staying (burning memory into the crown) presents clear trade-offs. However, the middle section lacks a distinct tightening moment before the revelation, relying more on accumulation than decisive turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of memory and forgetting, crystallizing in "mystery unraveled not by answers but by accepting the loop." The recurring fireflies shift from deadline markers to "silent applause," reweighting their significance. The final image of the crown burning above clouds "remembering for everyone what they were doomed to forget" achieves genuine resonance without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains lyric density with controlled imagery ("bleeding starlight that seeped from the sky like a wound no bandage could staunch"). POV remains stable with clean free indirect style tracking the queen's perceptions. Some passages risk purple prose ("lacy menace that wrapped her lungs with threads of ice"), but rhythm generally supports the dreamlike atmosphere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments of precise imagery ("obsidian shard reflecting not her face but the dream itself") alternate with overwritten passages that stack metaphors. Multiple instances of the phrase "ember grotto on the ridge" feel like artifact repetition. Filter-verb clusters appear ("trembling, she realized," "she inhaled," "feeling") that dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The time-loop revelation offers a fresh angle on prophecy stories—the queen warning herself backward through dreams. The paradoxical grotto temperature and bleeding starlight as physical memory create original world-logic. However, the mysterious queen archetype and mystical mountain journey follow familiar fantasy patterns without sufficient transformation.</comment>
