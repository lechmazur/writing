<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The traveler's internal transformation from writing others' obituaries to understanding her own absence shows strong character arc with embodied emotion ("ink-stained fingers trembling"). The final realization that she was her own first client creates meaningful change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional peaks ("lonesome splendor of choosing one's own ending").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through pattern accumulation of absences becoming presences, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where the traveler transforms from explaining absences to inhabiting them. The cost is legible in her seven years of work and the final image of returning to the world "armed now with the geography of healing." Slight deduction for abstract phrasing that occasionally dulls the cost's immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shadowed garden setting actively constrains and enables the ritual of unwinding the thread, with paths spelling words and shadows becoming portals. Environment directly shapes the transformation through "dried fountain" and "autumn light filtered through bare branches." Missing higher band because some descriptions lean abstract rather than viscerally tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking understanding to the revelation of self-recognition, with meaningful deepening when she realizes "she'd been her own first client." The cost accumulates through seven years of work and manifests in the final choice to return to ordinary life. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens but could be more viscerally felt in peak moments.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the central metaphor of explained absences becoming presence, culminating in "every explained absence was really just a presence waiting to be recognized." The weft thread serves as effective recurring motif that constrains choice and charges the final transformation. Slight deduction for occasionally abstract articulation of theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice with controlled rhythm and effective use of lists ("Mrs. Chen who'd wanted to die before her memories faded, Mr. Patel who'd wished to disappear"). POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Some register drift into elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "geography of healing") that occasionally breaks voice consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the unwinding sequence where each turn reveals character histories. Some abstract phrasing ("intimate work of projecting presence," "geography of healing") and occasional synonym loops ("absence/presence" repetition) prevent higher scoring. No major artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh concept of writing obituaries for the living who then vanish, with original synthesis of absence/presence metaphysics. The weft thread as extracted presence shows inventive world-building. Execution transforms the premise through specific character details though some abstract phrasing prevents full originality impact.</comment>
