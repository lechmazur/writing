<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marrow's characterization succeeds through concrete embodied details ("wrapped in borrowed starlight," "pressed her palms against ice walls until skin stuck") and her defining trait of weaving truth carefully shapes key choices. The internal journey from guarded isolation to "first unguarded expression" lands with earned cost. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("sorrow," "forgiveness") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with pattern-based escalation from dream-vision to physical descent to final understanding. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the pure globe's retrieval and Marrow's transformation ("first unguarded expression"), with visible cost in the glacier's collapse and passengers dissolving. The orientation anchors arrive late but serve the dreamlike opening; cost is felt but could be more visceral at the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glacier-as-setting constrains choices effectively (ice walls that stick to skin, closing corridors, unfrozen water sphere) and the shrine's candles revealing windows drives discovery. Sensory detail is selective and vivid ("crevasse-blue ice," "rime," "jellyfish" memories). The glacier's agency as negotiator elevates setting beyond backdrop, though some descriptions edge toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure: dream-vision leads to shrine exploration, then glacier negotiation, culminating in the choice to retrieve the pure globe as the glacier closes. The cost manifests in the wreck's collapse and passengers' dissolution. Escalation follows the textural lens appropriately but lacks a sharp tightening moment that would elevate to higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "windows of connection" and the pure thing salvaged from wreckage. The ending's mirror showing "every cameo face...now at peace" offers resonant non-literal closure about shared human experience across dreams. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("tapestry whose pattern") but the concrete imagery dominates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled compression ("wreck-diver ghost whisperer," "glacier folded inside like a secret"). POV distance remains stable with clean focalization on Marrow throughout. Perceptual signature strong in selective attention to ice, water, and memory. Some sentences edge toward purple prose but rhythm generally supports the dreamlike atmosphere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("luxury liner folded inside a glacier like a secret"). Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("borrowed starlight filtering through crevasse-blue ice") and some abstract emotional labeling. No significant loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diving, ghost whispering, and dream analysis creates a fresh angle on familiar supernatural territory. The specific detail of cameo dream appearances as "walk-on roles that hint at deeper currents" shows genuine originality. The glacier-as-negotiator and memories-as-jellyfish elevate beyond standard ghost story tropes.</comment>
