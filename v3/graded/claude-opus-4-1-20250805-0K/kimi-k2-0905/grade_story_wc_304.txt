<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The beautician mortician's internal transformation from seeking external sparks to recognizing her own as the essential element shows strong character-particular motivation, with her ritualistic practice of "finding patterns in static" from 342 corpses driving toward self-dissolution. The choice to dissolve into aurora is earned through seven years of accumulated grief and the recognition that she herself must become "the ferryman," though some interior passages lean toward abstract philosophizing rather than embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the protagonist's dissolution into aurora, with visible cost as she sacrifices her physical form to preserve the sparks of the dead within "the lattice of her bones." The accumulative/textural lens coheres as patterns from 342 corpses build toward the final transformation, though the middle section's heavy reflection slightly dulls the pressure before the strong closure lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto functions as more than setting—it's a "threshold of stillness" that enables the transformation, with crystal stalactites, mirror pool, and aurora creating a liminal space where dissolution becomes possible. Sensory details like "starlight dripping," "honey through a sieve," and the pool's "trembling with color" are filtered through the protagonist's specific perception as someone who reads death's patterns.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving sparks before oblivion—intensifies when she discovers "the spark she sought to capture was not theirs but her own," forcing the choice between preservation and dissolution. The pressure builds through accumulation of the 342 patterns into the emerald chip, though the middle reflection passage temporarily releases tension before the final decisive action of stepping into the pool.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme emerges through the concrete image of becoming "a ferryman across the river of forgetting," with the final line crystallizing that "the only ferryman is the one who becomes the river"—a non-literal answer to how beauty preserves memory. The recurring patterns in static, the emerald chip as vessel, and the dissolution into aurora all serve this central question without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm, particularly strong in passages like "time moved like honey through a sieve" and the accumulation of death-patterns ("the widow who died mid-sentence planning her husband's favorite soup"). Some middle passages drift toward elevated diction ("lucidly watchful from within her own circuitry") that slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs—"crystal stalactites that dripped with starlight" establishes setting while creating the liminal atmosphere. Some repetition of "threshold of stillness" and "lucidly watchful" creates mild scaffold, and occasional abstract phrases like "radiant hush" and "lattice of her bones" lean toward purple prose without fully crossing into opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The beautician mortician who preserves beauty in death by becoming the preservation medium herself offers a fresh synthesis, with specific details like harvesting patterns from corpses and the dragon's tear duct emerald avoiding generic death-work tropes. The transformation from observer to river, from preserver to preservation itself, feels earned through the accumulated particulars.</comment>
