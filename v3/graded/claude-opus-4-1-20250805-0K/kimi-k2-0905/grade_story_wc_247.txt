I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and symbolic gestures rather than causal plot mechanics, culminating in a resonant transformation of the harbor's relationship to silence and music.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The advisor's motivation to "translate silence into music" manifests through concrete, embodied actions—signing, mapping, subtracting sounds—with each gesture carrying specific weight ("describing the shape of fog, the taste of rust"). His characterization through effect rather than interiority ("stray dogs lowered their heads in reverence") works well for this lyric mode, though the transformation's permanence on the townspeople could be more decisively earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the harbor's silence becomes music, fundamentally altering how the community relates to sound and absence. The cost appears in "tears shining with joyful sorrow" and the lasting change where people "rehearsed the shapes of things they could not say aloud." The accumulative structure coheres well, though the transformation mechanism (signing creates phosphor trails that become music) edges toward convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The luminous harbor becomes an active participant—moonlight creates "silver ladders," water arranges into "slow-moving sheet music," buildings vibrate "like cello bodies." The setting constrains the advisor's work to specific locations (capstan, cannery roof) and times ("that slippery hour between last call and first gull"), directly shaping his methodology and the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through systematic deletion of sounds, each subtraction creating lighter emotional weight until the final orchestral release. The escalation from individual awakenings (boy, old woman) to collective transformation works, though the advisor faces no real opposition or cost to his actions—the transformation occurs too smoothly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The central theme—silence as potential music awaiting permission—emerges organically through concrete actions rather than statements. The final insight that "emptiness can be wound forward, exposed to light, and returned as song" reweights the entire narrative, particularly the empty camera's significance. The piece resists easy resolution, leaving the transformation's meaning productively ambiguous.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinctive lyric register with controlled metaphorical density ("leather case cracked like an old map," "carried like a lantern beneath the ribs"). The narrative distance suits the fable-like quality, and specialized maritime vocabulary grounds the ethereal events. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the transformation sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong imagistic precision throughout ("phosphor trail only visible where moonlight kissed salt"), though occasional overwriting appears ("tears shining with joyful sorrow"). The prose maintains high information density with most sentences carrying both literal and symbolic weight. Some metaphorical vehicles stretch credibility (water arranging into sheet music) but serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of mapping silence through sign language and an empty camera offers genuine freshness, synthesizing maritime tradition with synaesthetic transformation. The piece commits fully to its lyric logic without retreating into explanation. The risk of sustaining this register throughout pays off, creating a singular piece that resists genre classification.</comment>
