<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Quince's personality-borrowing creates genuine internal contradiction as the widow's grief and astronomer's logic superpose in his chest, with the final choice to release borrowed souls carrying visible cost. The diagnostic label-speak ("eigenvalues of sorrow, vectors of longing") in peak moments prevents higher scoring despite strong embodied moments like "lungs full of lucid turbulence."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught personality borrowing paying off in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Quince releases all borrowed souls to restore the stars, accepting blank selfhood as cost. The closure lands cleanly with "to shine is to be alone together, and to feel is to let others go" crystallizing the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The topaz workshop's translucent dome and starlit setting effectively constrain choices (working by starlight, vanishing stars as pressure), with the press itself as active micro-setting. The halo fragment's physical integration into paper and later cracking into seven rays charges the final image, though some occupational detail remains abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating borrowed personalities until the superposition creates crisis, with the halo child's revelation forcing Quince's choice between keeping borrowed souls or restoring stars. The cost is legible as he accepts terrifying blankness, though the middle section could tighten the pressure between revelation and choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mathematics/emotion paradox, with the halo fragment's message "To feel another is to forget the weight of zero" paying off in Quince printing himself "faint but legible." The final line about release elegantly reweights the entire borrowing mechanism without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature with phrases like "leaden fractions of sense" and "eigenvalues of sorrow," though register occasionally drifts into overly elevated diction ("lucid turbulence," "lattice of his own"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance, but some syntactic patterns become repetitive in the middle section.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but overwriting appears in peak beats ("lucid turbulence," "spectral tears," "ragged sky") without pattern-teaching. Template cadence emerges in parallel structures ("He found...fed it...let the press") and filter-verb clustering reduces immediacy in crucial moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The letterpress-as-empathy-machine concept offers fresh synthesis, with personality strips as negatives and the press printing backwards creating specific texture. The mathematics of emotion pursuit and the halo fragment's integration feel organic to this world, though some metaphysical elements trend toward familiar territory.</comment>
