<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between firefighter duty and need to honor her arsonist father creates genuine complexity, with micro-choices (grafting sand, tying the coin) revealing values under pressure. The final promise to bring saplings shows earned transformation through specific ritual acts rather than epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through ritual gestures toward the Resonant Reconfiguration of Mara choosing growth over erasure. Cost is visible in the "guilty fingerprints" and her practiced opposition to her father, though the final image could sharpen the price of reconciliation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and salt-tolerant pines function as active setting that enables Mara's grafting ritual and mirrors her internal state ("kelp-drift peace"). Sensory details are POV-filtered through her firefighter's awareness of heat and burning, making the environment inseparable from character.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving "scars can sing"—deepens through accumulating ritual acts (pouring sand, tying coin, recording coordinates) that test Mara's belief. The tension between honoring and opposing her father tightens at "practicing to become the opposite of him," though a sharper foreclosure of options would strengthen closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image system of fire/water/growth without didactic statement until the earned realization that scars might "harmonize" rather than erase. The final image of the coin as "dark moon on red orbit" resonantly answers whether destruction can become creation through "unyielding compassion."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through firefighter's consciousness ("sprinkler heads," "Station Green 13"), with controlled psychic distance that tightens during memory intrusions. Prose rhythm modulates effectively between meditative present action and compressed flashback, though some filter verb clusters appear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("clouds that drifted like kelp in the sky"), and figurative language serves POV without overwhelming. Minor template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions and occasional filter verb stacks ("she felt," "she saw") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of firefighter-daughter/arsonist-father through botanical grafting as emotional reconciliation is genuinely fresh, with the foreign coin and volcanic sand creating specific texture. The risk of the lyric-accumulative structure pays off through earned resonance rather than plot mechanics.</comment>
