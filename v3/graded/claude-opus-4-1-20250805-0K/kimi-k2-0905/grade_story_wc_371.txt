<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mila's progression from passive observer to active cultivator of memory shows clear internal conflict and embodied choice, particularly in the guerrilla gardening sequences where she acts "heuristically gentle" with visible cost. The characterization falters slightly with abstract phrases like "creeping normality noticer by trade" and some diagnostic language ("sacred in the ordinary"), but her micro-choices—wrapping bread in her scarf, choosing burial sites, tasting crumbs—reveal authentic values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration: Mila transforms from documenting erasure to actively cultivating memory, with visible cost in her soil-stained hands and permanent role change. The pattern of disappearance→bread discovery→guerrilla planting→restoration accumulates pressure effectively, though the mechanism of how bread-planting restores shops remains somewhat magical rather than causally grounded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The decaying palace courtyard and vanishing shops create genuine spatial pressure that constrains choices—Mila must act covertly "by moonlight" and the narrowing alleys physically embody the city's amnesia. Sensory details like "flour ghosts," "tea-steam sighs," and herbs "wearing flakes of crust like name tags" are specific and purposeful, with the environment directly enabling the guerrilla gardening solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether memory can resist systematic erasure—escalates from observation to intervention with clear cost: Mila risks "sealing the amnesia" by eating the bread and commits to permanent transformation. The progression from noticing to planting to witnessing restoration shows meaningful deepening, though the conflict lacks a concrete antagonistic force beyond the abstract "creeping normality."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bread-as-resurrection metaphor beautifully unifies action and meaning without explicit moralizing, particularly in "bread is daily resurrection, and absolution is not granted but cultivated." The final image of Mila brewing tea "among ruins that refuse to forget" resonantly answers whether memory can be preserved, with the sacred revealed as "always ordinary, always enough" emerging from concrete gardening acts rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyrical voice maintains consistent texture through phrases like "heuristically gentle" and "uncloak," with rhythmic control in sequences like "Together they moved by moonlight, heuristically gentle, slicing the sanctified loaf." Some passages drift toward elevated register ("liturgy against forgetting") that slightly strains the POV, but the perceptual signature—noticing architectural decay and botanical growth—remains distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "shops still disappeared, yet now each guerrilla garden grew a bench where strangers rested." However, abstract phrases like "creeping normality" appear 5+ times creating mild repetition, and some sentences strain with elevated diction ("absolution stays tenuous only if left unleavened") that obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of urban decay, guerrilla gardening, and bread-as-memory creates a fresh angle on amnesia/preservation themes, with specific details like bread wearing "crust armor" and herbs spelling "old shop names in basil and marjoram." The concept of a professional "creeping normality noticer" and the bread-planting ritual feel genuinely original, earning the +0.3 risk distinction for unconventional premise.</comment>
