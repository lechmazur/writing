I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds density through layered imagery and memory toward a resonant reconfiguration at closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's grief-driven carving process shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously - preserving Emil's memory while accepting his death. The widow's internal conflict between holding on ("keeping the cage door closed") and letting go manifests through concrete micro-choices with the carving tools. Minor deduction for some emotional summarizing ("rust-hued peace") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - Mara accepts that "memory can be both cage and key" with visible cost in the final image where she sees "both her face and the empty ring below." The accumulative structure builds through carving stages toward this crystallized acceptance. Slight temporal confusion around "Emil's gloved hand slip into hers after the funeral" weakens mid-story causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The loft setting with its rain-beaded skylight creates atmospheric pressure that mirrors internal state, particularly in how "rain-light pooled across its untouched face." The carving tools ground the action concretely. The circus tent references feel slightly disconnected from the primary loft space, creating minor spatial drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through the carving process as each cut deepens Mara's confrontation with loss - from blank wood to "miniature ring, a stool, a man mid-bow." The dominant stake of processing grief tightens as she moves from Emil's figure to planning the lion's face "eyes open." Cost becomes visible in accepting death's "better hearing" than Emil's commands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cage/key duality emerges organically through concrete details - the iron latch, the carved figures, the commands that "death had better hearing" for. The final image of Mara reflected alongside "the empty ring below" offers resonant non-literal closure. The sawdust jars labeled like spices ("Manes & Mettle") risk slight preciousness but serve the accumulative pattern.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, though some sentences strain under figurative weight ("hauntingly practical, the way Emil's voice used to cut through sawdust and roar alike"). The perceptual signature of a craftsperson processing grief through physical work remains strong. Slight register elevation in places ("rust-hued peace") that doesn't fully match the widow's practical nature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Several instances of paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "here and gone" appears three times with minimal variation; "rust-hued peace" repeats exactly. Mixed metaphor in "harvest lessons from loss the way Emil taught her to harvest trust from predators" strains coherence. Strong opening and closing images partially offset these issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of grief-as-craft offers a fresh angle, with the widow literally carving memory into permanence. The sawdust jar collection labeled like spices shows inventive detail. However, the lion-tamer's-widow-processing-grief premise follows familiar emotional territory without sufficient transformation to reach higher originality bands.</comment>
