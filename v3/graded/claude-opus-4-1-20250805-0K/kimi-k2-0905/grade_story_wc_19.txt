<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's claustrophobia and its transcendence are embodied through concrete actions—crawling from the hatch, lungs stretching, collecting silences—with genuine internal contradiction between fear and yearning. The final choice to release rather than possess the silences demonstrates earned transformation with visible cost (leaving the doll behind). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around silence-collecting that occasionally drifts toward concept over embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where collected silences are released, reweighting Lira's relationship to confinement—she returns to the bunker but "walls...could no longer contain her." The piece teaches its metaphysical rules early (gravity inversion, tangible-intangible planks) and pays them off. Cost is visible in leaving the doll and choosing release over possession. Minor orientation wobble around the pruner sequence slightly dulls mid-section causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The xenial trellis functions as active setting that guides and constrains movement ("single rail suspended"), while the inverted world creates genuine spatial disorientation that serves the concept. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (silence tasting "of iron doors sealing," roots "dangling like chandeliers"). The trellis's transformation from "xenial" to "trembling" as time expires adds environmental pressure to the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation of silence-flavors toward the membrane-breaking climax where "contracted chambers of her heart unfolded." The hour's time limit creates genuine pressure, and Lira's agency drives each collection choice. The cost is legible when she releases what she gathered rather than keeping it, though the pruner trade sequence slightly diffuses momentum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the paradox of collecting/releasing, confinement/expansion, with the doll as chrysalis metaphor earning its resonance through action. The final image of walls becoming "intangibly tangible" and Lira carrying "stretched sky in every breath" offers a non-literal answer to the claustrophobia question without moralizing. Subtext operates throughout in the silence-flavors and their meanings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("gilded hush coated the air, thick as honey yet weightless") and consistent perceptual signature focused on silence, confinement, and breath. Clean focalization throughout with purposeful psychic distance shifts during the membrane sequence. Minor deduction for occasional drift into elevated register ("chrysalis from which silence had emerged") that slightly exceeds Lira's child-POV plausibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptions that advance both setting and emotional state. Clean syntax variety and purposeful rhythm control. Deduction for scattered instances of abstract phrasing ("flavors of different silences," "intangibly tangible") that occasionally prioritize concept over clarity, and minor template repetition in the "She [verb]" patterns mid-story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of claustrophobia, inverted gravity, and silence-as-substance creates a genuinely original premise. The transformation of collecting into releasing shows sophisticated thematic development beyond the expected. Risk-taking in the metaphysical mechanics (tangible-intangible planks, tradeable memories) heightens rather than obscures meaning, earning a +0.3 within-band bonus.</comment>
