<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's curiosity drives concrete action through noting patterns and reading dialects aloud, with her final choice to chart "Murmuration Passage" earning its cost through prior discovery. The crew's transformation from "sociable isolation" to shared purpose shows meaningful relational change. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("felt the sociable isolation lift") rather than fully embodied states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira's discovery transforms the ship from "stranded luminance" to renewed purpose, with visible cost in her risk-taking and the crew's previous isolation. The accumulative lens holds as patterns build from hopscotch spirals through dialect translations to starling formations. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (chart-room, apprentice cartographer Lira).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The airship's physical details (brass ribs, copper pipes, glass bulbs) constrain the crisis and enable resolution through the light-feed mechanism. Moonlight through grates creating the hopscotch pattern directly shapes Lira's discovery. The starling murmurations mirror internal patterns effectively, though some sensory detail remains visual-dominant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity through ship-wide crisis ("become a ghost above the clouds") to collective transformation. The dimming lights create genuine urgency that forces Lira's decisive action. Cost is visible in the crew's isolation and Lira's shaking knees as she takes responsibility for the ship's survival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the intersection of "language and landscape," with the seventeen dialects becoming literal fuel for the ship's story-powered engines. The final image of shared light replacing isolation offers resonant closure without stating a moral. The hopscotch patterns accumulating into navigation charts deepens the discovery theme through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical precision ("cloud-sea," "stranded luminance") and controlled metaphorical register fitting an apprentice cartographer's perspective. Clean POV control throughout with effective free indirect style. Slight deduction for occasional filter verbs ("She sensed") that could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("flour-fine dust," "copper pipes sweated pale steam"). Some template cadence in middle sections ("She knelt... She sensed... She sprinted") and occasional paraphrase loops ("stranded luminance" appears three times). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of navigation, language, and light as interconnected systems creates genuine originality. The concept that ships run on stories rather than fuel transforms the steampunk airship trope meaningfully. Risk-taking in the lyrical register and conceptual premise heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
