<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal contradiction between rejecting and understanding her father drives genuine complexity, particularly in "She had refused to see him as anything but a failure. Now she saw the lattice of love beneath the ruin." The final choice to "bet on herself" earns its resonance through accumulated discoveries, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic clarity ("theoretically rebellious daughter who inherited his mind but not his disease").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as Mira shifts from resistance to active engagement ("She bet on herself"), with visible cost in leaving the lantern "For the next exception." The accumulative lens holds as cryptic messages guide her toward understanding, each discovery reweighting the father-daughter relationship. Minor orientation debt exists around the timeline of finding messages "for weeks" before his death.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The library's "wet stone and old paper" and "clover melancholy" create atmospheric specificity that charges the discovery. The lantern's mica pane fracturing light becomes a visual metaphor for perspective-shifting. Setting could constrain choices more actively, but the basement archives and subway system provide coherent spatial anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen meaningfully when the diary reveals her father's wagers about her ("I stake my last breath on her finding the lantern"), forcing Mira to confront her refusal to see him beyond failure. The cost manifests in her transformation from passive reader to active participant, leaving annotated pages throughout the city. The escalation could tighten further through more immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of "lucid contradictions" emerges organically through the father's paradox (probability professor/compulsive gambler) and Mira's journey from refusing to seeing. The final image of betting on herself while refusing to gamble captures thematic complexity without moralizing. "To hold and release, to mourn and move" crystallizes earned wisdom through concrete experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, particularly in accumulative passages like "She would not gamble, but she would risk. Not on odds, but on openness." POV remains stable with clean free indirect style. Some moments edge toward elevated diction ("lattice of love beneath the ruin") but serve the piece's meditative tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence lengths creating breathing rhythm between discovery and reflection. Information density remains high, with lines like "The lantern now held no candle, only a folded slip of paper" doing multiple jobs. Minor repetitive structures appear ("She had come... She had begun... She had refused") but create purposeful accumulation rather than loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of gambling father/probability professor with cryptic city messages offers fresh specificity. The transformation of the lantern from practical object to symbolic vessel shows ingenuity. While parent-child reconciliation is familiar territory, the particular details (mica pane, pressed clover, subway scrawls) create memorable texture.</comment>
