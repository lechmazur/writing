<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's insomnia drives concrete choices throughout—climbing at night, painting with exhausted clarity, using the brush despite its strange power. Her internal state ("eyes felt rinsed by moonlight") embodies contradiction effectively. The final exhausted sleep after seventeen hours shows genuine cost, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("lantern guiding the brush").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through language-as-breath metaphor until the greenhouse becomes "a lung for the whole sleepless neighborhood." The ending achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as lost languages spread through the city, with cost visible in Mira's seventeen-hour collapse. Orientation anchors clearly (painter, greenhouse, night).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse constrains and enables the entire action—its trapped air thickens with painted words, glass panes trap then release the language-breath. Sensory detail layers effectively ("peat and saffron quiet," "bruised marigolds"). The rooftop position above smog creates necessary isolation for the transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal artistic completion to communal linguistic resurrection. The brush taking control of Mira's wrist meaningfully tightens agency. Cost lands in her exhaustion and the irreversible release of lost languages, though the universal positive outcome slightly softens tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action—lost languages literally painted into being, then breathed into the city. The final image of "green prints on the pavement like breadcrumbs" resonantly reweights the opening's "damp prints on iron steps." Kindness-as-memory motif earns its recurrence through specific images.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("moon tipped higher, and the bristles began to glow, not with light but with sound"). Perceptual signature strong in how Mira notices texture and color. Some moments edge toward purple prose ("saffron quiet," "syllables curling into vines") but remain purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("the greenhouse becoming a lung for the whole sleepless neighborhood"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("seed-like, into the streets," "fatigue finally a blanket rather than a blade") but serves the lyric mode. Occasional abstract phrasing ("methodically hopeful") reduces immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of painting lost languages that become breathable transforms familiar artist-at-work territory through specific execution. The moon-tipped brush writing "prayers in a language abolished by decree" offers fresh political subtext. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulation pays off with the lung/breath transformation.</comment>
