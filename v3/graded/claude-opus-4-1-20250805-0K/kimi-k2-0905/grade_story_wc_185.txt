<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mapkeeper's motivation is crystallized through concrete actions—preserving maps, reading ice patterns, protecting silence—with embodied tension in "bones vibrate, marrow threatening to become melody." The final choice to release stored voices carries visible cost ("carrying nothing but the hush they had learned to grow"), though some interior states lean toward abstraction rather than full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the dome's silencing creates Earned Stasis where the mapkeeper releases voices "in a single sigh that carried no sound, only meaning" with clear cost. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building from ice divination to the bloom of hush's manifestation. Minor orientation delay (who/where takes ~150 words) doesn't harm closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The harmonic caves function as active constraint—stalactites that "chimed if you breathed too hard," the Mirror Pool requiring stillness, the Abyssal Gate's unhearable frequency. Setting directly shapes tactics throughout, from ice-reading to the dome's "scalloped walls," with the environment's transformation charging the final image of healing caves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal survival to cultural preservation, tightening through the ice prophecy's one-hour window and climaxing when the mapkeeper must complete the silencing circle while "bones vibrate, marrow threatening to become melody." The cost is legible in releasing all stored voices and leaving with "nothing but the hush," though agency could be sharper at the peak moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of preserving voice through silence, with the echo chamber stone embodying this tension by storing words "like rainwater." The final release of "every swallowed word in a single sigh that carried no sound, only meaning" offers resonant answer without moralizing, though the "We were here" whisper edges toward explicit statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyric precision: "ripple-mark mapkeeper," "hammered repose," "bloom of hush." The perceptual signature is consistent—focusing on patterns, textures, geological time. Minor convergence occurs when Jalen's limited presence doesn't fully distinguish his voice, but the controlled compression and rhythm support the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines like "scrolls inked with tidal ridges: each ridge a memory of a season before." Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("columns of radiant static, faces formed from stolen voices") occasionally crowds clarity. The prose maintains propulsion through varied syntax, though a few abstract constructions ("hammered repose") risk opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of geological time, sound-as-predator, and silence-as-survival creates an original world. The ice divination system and "bloom of hush" as tactical resource show genuine invention. The transformation of energy beings from destroyers to "dimming embers" through engineered silence, plus risk-taking with the lyric-accumulative structure, elevates within band (+0.3).</comment>
