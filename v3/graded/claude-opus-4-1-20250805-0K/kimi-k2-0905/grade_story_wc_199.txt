I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through pattern and resonance rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mireya's transformation from orderly sorter to Keeper of Tiny Monuments tracks cleanly with visible cost (moss-covered palms, heightened perception). Her motivation crystallizes through concrete action rather than declaration, and the final choice to release the moonstone carries earned weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully—leaves cease rebellion and the arbor finds equilibrium through collective memory-making. The accumulative structure teaches its pattern early (rising leaves → monuments → restoration) and pays off with the mirror-world revelation that reweights all prior monument-building.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor functions as active constraint—its floating nature necessitates the monument solution, and specific details (silver bark, ashen sky, lichened branches) create a lived-in otherworld. The micro-settings of individual monuments ("acorn cup," "ring of ash keys") carry emotional specificity that charges the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to grove-wide participation to cosmic dialogue between realms. The moonstone's warming and the leaves' accelerating spirals create genuine pressure, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly without a sharp crisis moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the act of remembering forgotten things—each monument becomes a meditation on what deserves preservation. The final image of the arbor "buoyed by the gentle weight of everything we refuse to let go" offers profound resonance without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent mythic register with selective perception ("pollen spirals," "root whispers") that deepens as Mireya transforms. The folkloric cadence ("Remember with kindness, and the sky will remember you") feels earned rather than imposed, though some passages lean toward elevated diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves lyrical density with lines like "soft thunder" and "mossy delight unfurling like fern fronds," though occasional redundancy appears ("emerges transformed always" repeated). The final paragraph's "emerges transformed always" feels forced as a callback to the required attribute.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The central conceit of monuments to forgotten things offers genuine freshness—not just memory but the physical act of building tiny shrines. The mirror-world revelation and the office of "Keeper of Tiny Monuments" elevate beyond standard fantasy fare.</comment>
