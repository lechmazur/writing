<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between skeptic-identity and haunted-follower creates genuine tension, with micro-choices (kneeling, humming, accepting color-blindness) revealing value hierarchy under pressure. The cost of vision-loss for memory-recovery lands viscerally. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("ghostly resolve" remains label-like) but the embodied transformation and earned renunciation elevate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through resonance structures, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where private memory becomes public archive with the visible cost of color-vision. The orientation anchors clearly (velvet garden, twilight, Mara with shell). The closure transforms isolation into shared anthem with undeniable cost, though the final commuter moment slightly dilutes the primary transformation's impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The garden functions as more than backdrop—its transforming elements (petals to pages, pond to ledger) constrain and enable Mara's archiving choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("like trespassing inside a bruise"). The environment actively participates in closure through the white flowers that erupt where she walks, though some descriptions edge toward ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (recovering quarantined memory) escalates through accumulating pressure: shell's instructions → garden's response → cost of color-vision → public dispersal. The price is legible and irreversible. Agency manifests through Mara's choice to pay the sensory cost for collective freedom. Minor deduction for the somewhat mechanical final beat with the commuter.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "isolation into independence" then into "shared anthem," with the garden becoming a living counter-archive to state control. The resonant final image of memory preferring "to live in plural" reweights the entire piece without moralizing. The shell as "resonant key" matching Mara's internal fracture creates meaningful unity between personal and political.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical density ("velvet garden...like trespassing inside a bruise") and consistent perceptual signature. Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from Mara's skeptic-broadcaster register ("tragically radiant and utterly her own"). The prose maintains atmospheric consistency though rhythmic variation could heighten at peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful imagery, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("petals unfolding backwards, stems exhaled chlorophyll mist"). Minor template-cadence in middle section transitions. The paraphrase-adjacent phrasing around "ghostly resolve" recurring without evolution costs clarity. Information density is high and most sentences do multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a garden that archives forbidden memories through resonance structures offers genuine freshness, transforming surveillance-state tropes through specific sensory cost (color-blindness for memory-freedom). The image of memories preferring "to live in plural" synthesizes personal and collective liberation originally. Slight deduction for the somewhat expected "skeptic becomes believer" arc.</comment>
