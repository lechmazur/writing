<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The carver's fiercely meditative nature manifests through concrete actions like sitting cross-legged among headstones and applying patience to the butterfly's dance. Her transformation from carving death markers to creating "gardens where grief could continue transforming" shows earned change with visible cost. However, internal conflict remains more contemplative than contradictory-in-scene, and the spectral grandmother's voice borders on diagnostic wisdom-speak ("You seek the shape of collective grief, child") rather than embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the carver transforms from marking endings to creating spaces for ongoing transformation, with the ribbon roll's metamorphosis serving as concrete cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds as butterfly imagery, poetry fragments, and grief patterns layer toward the chrysalis climax. However, the revelation about sleep-carving headstones feels unmotivated by prior causality, and orientation wobbles with the greenhouse's shifting scale (ancient yet containing a massive oak with roots around headstones).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively constrains and enables the narrative—glass panes create the "thundering calm," the oak growing through the ceiling charges the revelation scene, and chrysalises on rusted watering cans ground the spectral elements. Sensory detail effectively narrows during the chrysalis sequence. The spatial choreography occasionally strains credibility (a massive oak with headstones inside a greenhouse), but the setting consistently shapes choices and charges the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding collective grief—deepens through accumulation: butterfly patterns spelling poem fragments, discovery of sleep-carved headstones, and the chrysalis transformation sequence. The protagonist's agency manifests in following, touching stones, and allowing transformation. However, escalation relies heavily on spectral revelation rather than protagonist-driven pressure, and the cost remains more conceptual than visceral despite the ribbon's transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of butterflies wrapping themselves in poem fragments before transformation, paralleling how the village wraps grief in traded poetry. The final insight—that some memorials must be lived rather than carved—reweights all prior material without explicit moralizing. The recurring butterfly/chrysalis imagery effectively constrains choice and charges closure, though some passages edge toward abstract philosophizing ("the shape of collective grief").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a lyric, contemplative register appropriate to the gravestone carver's perspective, with consistent focalization and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows in how she notices carving details and transformation patterns. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with embodied grief ("thundering calm" appears multiple times), and the grandmother's spectral dialogue tends toward wisdom-speak rather than naturalistic voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Information density remains high with most sentences advancing multiple layers—the chrysalises "hanging from rusted watering cans" simultaneously establishes setting, decay, and transformation. However, template cadence appears in the butterfly sequence ("The butterflies began forming patterns... The fiercely meditative carver sat... The spectral mentorship reached..."), and several passages loop similar concepts about grief and transformation. The phrase "thundering calm" repeats without earning its paradox through variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The central conceit of sleep-carving poems as dates rather than names offers genuine freshness, as does the image of chrysalises wrapped in poem fragments. The synthesis of butterfly migration with collective grief processing feels specific to this story. However, the spectral mentorship framework and wise grandmother guide are familiar tropes not fully transformed, and some metaphors (transformation, metamorphosis) remain safely within expected territory.</comment>
