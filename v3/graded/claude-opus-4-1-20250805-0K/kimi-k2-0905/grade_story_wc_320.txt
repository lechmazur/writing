<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The interpreter's progression from assumption-shedding to transformative understanding shows clear internal conflict acting simultaneously in scene, particularly in lines like "tears blurred the dials" as realization dawns. Her choice to build a new receiver demonstrates earned change with visible cost (the dissolved star fragment). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around conceptual elements that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the shard's transformation into revealed broadcasts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence becomes "rehearsal" and endings become "hinges." The cost is felt through the loss of the star fragment and the interpreter's released "lifetime of conclusions." Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the situation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tower city setting actively constrains and enables choices—the interpreter must climb into the transmitter room, work with shattered tubes, and the lunar perigee's gravitational pull creates physical pressure that "stretched the gorge wider." The final image of descending stairs while "counting each rusted step as the first word" charges the environment with transformed meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving vs. understanding the shard of hush) escalates through the interpreter's active choice to feed the star fragment into the circuit, accepting its dissolution. The tension between initial mandate to "tune it before it ate every last transmission" and final understanding that silence is "not a threat but a cocoon" shows meaningful deepening with clear cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of silence from threat to cocoon, endings as beginnings, with the recurring motif of the star fragment's dissolution enabling rebirth. The final insight that "every quiet is merely rehearsal, every finale a hinge" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral, earned through concrete experience with the shard.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature shows in selective details like "antennas humming like crickets that had learned grammar" and the synesthetic "serenely electric pins that mapped constellations across her skin." Some elevated diction ("sublimated into pure photon") occasionally drifts from the established register, and filter phrases appear in stressed moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "dust motes drifted in slow-motion waltzes lit by the bloated moon," but several paraphrase loops appear ("every quiet is merely rehearsal, every finale a hinge, every shard a seed"). Template cadence in the final paragraphs ("She smiled... She stepped... She walked...") dulls momentum at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of signal interpretation as archaeological recovery of lost voices offers fresh angle on familiar "keeper of lost things" trope. The specific synthesis of Hollywood glamour fragment with cosmic silence, and the tower city as radio antenna forest creates memorable particulars. The transformation of hush from destroyer to protector shows genuine conceptual ingenuity.</comment>
