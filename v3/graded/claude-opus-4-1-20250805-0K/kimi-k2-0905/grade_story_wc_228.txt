<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ren's journey from "intimately aloof" painter to someone who accepts both distance and connection shows genuine internal contradiction, particularly in how he simultaneously destroys (abandoning the room) and preserves (the shell painting). The micro-choices under pressure—cutting his thumb, not locking the door, entering the cave without hesitation—reveal consistent character logic. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution where his exact brushwork appears in the found shell.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the mirror crack catalyzing a journey that accumulates meaning through salt, shells, and painted harbors, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Ren transfers his art to "temporary eternity." The cost is legible in his empty hands on the bus and the demolished quay above. Slight deduction for the magical realism element (his brushwork in the shell) which strains causality without being fully taught.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cave network functions as essential setting that constrains choice—Ren must go deeper to find the right place for his shell, the plankton light dictates his painting schedule, and the "mineral breath" creates atmosphere that charges the final preservation act. Strong sensory work with "gulls screamed like circular saws" and "crushed shells that chimed like tiny porcelain bells."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving the quay before demolition) tightens through the mirror's destruction forcing Ren to seek an alternative preservation method, deepening when he discovers the shell contains what he lost. The cost manifests in his abandonment of conventional art (empty hands) for hidden permanence. Minor deduction as the shell's discovery feels slightly convenient despite the accumulative texture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of temporary versus eternal emerges organically through concrete images—the cracked mirror, the condemned quay, the preserved shell—without explicit moralizing. The final image of plankton illuminating the hidden canvas while the real coast "forgot itself, wave by wave" offers a resonant answer about art's relationship to impermanence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("tasted salt though no blood had reached his lips"), though some passages edge toward overwriting ("cathedral veins, walls glazed by centuries of salt sweat"). The perceptual signature of an artist noticing color and light remains consistent. Deduction for occasional register elevation that strains against the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity, but several instances of elevated diction create friction: "intimate aloofness" appears three times, "cathedral veins" and "centuries of salt sweat" feel overwrought. Some filter-verb clustering ("he felt the weight," "he understood," "he recognized"). The closing sentence, while thematically resonant, runs long and could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of art preserved in hidden places while originals vanish offers a fresh angle on loss and permanence. The specific synthesis of mirror/shell, painted harbor/real demolition creates originality. However, the magical realism element (finding his own brushwork) and the somewhat predictable artist-preserving-art arc prevent higher scoring.</comment>
