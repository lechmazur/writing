<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's grief-driven journey shows strong internal contradiction between his need to honor mother's rituals and his knowledge that the compass is "a beautiful lie." The final choice to enter the impossible corridor with mother is earned through accumulated loss and relativistic isolation. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("guilt of surviving") rather than fully embodied states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching of temporal distortion leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kael enters the folded space. The cost is legible in abandoning linear time and reality ("Years later—though years had lost their meaning"). Orientation anchors establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sealed observation deck and temporal distortion create genuine constraints—the "temporally stretched" starfield and phase-shifted station shape Kael's final choice. The crawlspace "no larger than a coffin" with mother's star maps charges the climactic transformation. Some generic space station details don't fully exploit the setting's potential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating impossibilities: compass spinning toward nonexistent vectors, mother's voice through dead intercoms, discovering her posthumous maps, then the corridor of light. The cost of leaving reality is clear when Kael's jacket remains as the only anchor to linear time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ending reweights the entire premise through "True north is whoever waits for you to turn confusion into exploration"—transforming navigation from spatial to relational. The gilded compass pointing "not to a direction but to her" crystallizes this thematic repricing without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature in "carried the echo of its silence in his bones" and controlled psychic distance that tightens during the transformation sequence. Clean POV control throughout with purposeful compression during the time-dilation moment. Minor formulaic phrasing in places ("hollowed heart").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control with sentences like "Time dilated the moment the latch clicked; his heartbeat stretched into whale song" that embody the temporal distortion. Some overwrought metaphors ("blessed pariah," "hollowed heart") and minor repetitive stems but high information density overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The phase-shifted station as a "pocket where grief could be temporally stretched" offers fresh synthesis of space station and grief narrative. The mother appearing "the age she had been the night she first sketched the sky" transforms expected ghost story mechanics through relativistic logic.</comment>
