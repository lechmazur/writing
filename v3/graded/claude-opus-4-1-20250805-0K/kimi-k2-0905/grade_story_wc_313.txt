I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered discoveries and images toward a resonant reconfiguration where Marisol transforms from private grief to communal witness.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marisol's internal journey from dutiful patrol to confronting her father's hidden life is rendered through concrete discoveries (bottle, photographs) that force micro-choices. The contradiction between destroying evidence and creating new documentation earns the final stance. Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated "private grief she could finally release."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works beautifully—each photograph deepens the revelation until the Polaroid forces Marisol's reckoning. The closure (destroying the label, creating new documentation) constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear emotional cost. The pattern of descent/discovery/transformation holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drowned town emerging "one deliberate foot per day" creates a haunting temporal setting that constrains the story's possibilities. Sensory details like "slime," "ankle-deep silt," and the intact bottle waiting "as if" are selective and purposeful. The ridgeway/underwater duality functions well but could push harder on constraining choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stake (confronting buried family history) intensifies through the photograph trail's deliberate revelation structure. The cost—understanding her father's sacrifice and her role in it—is felt in "the mirrored hush inside her chest." The transformation from private to communal witness provides meaningful escalation under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of submerged histories and chosen silences emerges organically through concrete discoveries. The final image of collective witnessing ("museum of common loss and common survival") resonantly reweights the opening's solitary patrol. The metaphor of resurfacing works at multiple levels without becoming heavy-handed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent distance with selective perception ("twilight that clung...like damp gauze"). The controlled, slightly formal register fits Marisol's careful nature. Some moments edge toward overwriting ("echoing the mirrored hush") but generally the prose serves the accumulative structure well.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("art-deco sign still attached to a wall that had once been the third floor"). Deductions for purple patches ("twilight...like damp gauze," "mirrored hush inside her chest") and the slightly overwrought final paragraph with its abstract "living text" metaphor that dulls the concrete power of earlier images.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The drowned town concept provides a fresh angle on buried family secrets. The specific detail of the Sapphire Swan lounge and the photograph trail leading to revelation shows originality. The transformation from evidence-destroyer to memory-keeper offers a non-obvious resolution, though the final metaphor of "living text" feels slightly workshopped.</comment>
