<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cassian's motivation to "thread a labyrinth with your own story" drives concrete choices—entering the lighthouse, climbing to confront his father, choosing to become the wolf himself. The internal conflict between inheriting lies and finding truth manifests through embodied details like the lattice warming against his ribs and the hush leaping into his chest. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("timeframe pressed like tide") that doesn't fully embody the emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Cassian declares "I am the son of the boy who cried wolf, and this time the wolf is me" with visible cost—he accepts becoming what his father was accused of being. The accumulative/textural lens holds as copper light, hush imagery, and the lattice pattern build toward this transformation. Orientation anchors clearly (Cassian, lighthouse prison, dusk arrival).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison functions as more than setting—its "impossible gravity" and stairs that "climbed into previous years" constrain and enable Cassian's journey. The Fresnel lens throwing "copper blades" and the lattice creating "a single, true beam" directly shape the closure transformation. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from entrance through spiral stairs to lantern room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from chasing silence to confronting the father-figure to accepting transformation into "the wolf." The meaningful deepening occurs when Cassian fits the lattice to the lens, revealing "the shape of a wolf made entirely of withheld truth"—this narrows his options to either retreat or become what was prophesied. Cost is visible in "carrying the hush now threaded through his veins."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of inherited lies into chosen truth—"this time the wolf is me, and I am not early, I am exact." The lattice/confessional motif accumulates meaning from "tooth-marks of a boy who once bit wood to stop himself from confessing" to becoming the lens that reveals truth. The ending reweights the entire cry-wolf parable without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice sustains lyric compression throughout—"copperlight repose glazing the rusted rails," "the hush was a living thing, coiling, fleeing." POV control remains stable with Cassian's perceptual signature filtering everything through inherited mythology. The prose rhythm accelerates during the confrontation and transformation sequences without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong figurative control with purposeful patterns like "copperlight repose" recurring to charge meaning. Some density issues with stacked metaphors ("the hush, now chased and cornered, leapt into his chest and became a heartbeat") that occasionally slow momentum. The phrase "thread a labyrinth with your own story" appears twice verbatim, creating a minor loop. Information density generally high with lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of the cry-wolf parable through the son's perspective, where becoming the wolf represents accepting difficult truth rather than deception. The lighthouse-as-prison-of-lies concept and the hush as trackable silence create non-obvious angles. The transformation feels earned through accumulated imagery rather than clever twist.</comment>
