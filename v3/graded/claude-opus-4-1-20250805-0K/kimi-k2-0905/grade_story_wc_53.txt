<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to negotiate with their younger ghost-self is clearly rooted in regret over abandoned ambitions, with concrete embodied details like "sand inside me, abrading the lens of ambition." The internal conflict between youth's velocity and age's decay manifests through specific actions (breaking the camera wheel, reading fragments aloud) that reveal character under pressure. Minor deduction for the ghost's slightly stock "chronological contempt" phrasing, but the final choice to accept mutual erosion carries visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught fragmentation (camera squares, story fragments, time confusion) that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where narrator and ghost achieve "shared erosion." The closure lands with felt cost ("I accept his velocity, he accepts my decay") and the final image of the ghost "waving with my own weary hand" reweights prior material. Orientation anchors (carousel, lagoon, 03:17) establish early. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract negotiation mechanics, but causality holds under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and carousel create a surreal but internally consistent setting where "cloudwater" and "silver glass" constrain movement and enable the ghost encounter. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("hissing where it touched the hot brass animals"). The obsidian mare functions as micro-setting that anchors the negotiation. Deduction for some abstraction in the lagoon's properties that doesn't fully pressure choices beyond enabling the meeting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reconciling with abandoned ambitions) signals early and tightens through the camera wheel's breaking, releasing "twenty-four undeveloped squares" that represent unrealized futures. Escalation follows the accumulative lens as fragments build pressure toward the mutual acceptance. The cost is legible in "regret is just empathy traveling backwards" and the final foreclosure of the youth's path. Minor deduction as the middle section's fragment-reading could have more concrete pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central image of erosion versus velocity, with the camera wheel's undeveloped squares serving as concrete metaphor for unrealized potential. The insight that "negotiation is not settlement but shared erosion" avoids tidy resolution while offering genuine wisdom. The recurring motif of collected story fragments from other passengers ("a bride who lost her vowels") enriches the meditation on regret without becoming ornamental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric compression ("I am chronologically confused; yesterday I buried tomorrow's body") that maintains consistency throughout. The perceptual signature shows in unique constructions like "brass poles exhaling steam" and "constellations projected upside-down so fish can dream of flying." No head-hopping, clean focalization, and the experimental time-confusion is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong sentence-level craft with varied rhythm and purposeful compression, but several instances of elevated diction that occasionally obscures clarity ("kinetic lagoon," "stroboscopic lights fade into fractured stillness"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition in "fragment" usage but it serves the accumulative pattern. The prose supports the surreal tone without becoming fully opaque.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of negotiating with one's younger ghost-self through collected story fragments offers genuine originality, avoiding standard time-travel or memory-lane tropes. The specific synthesis of carousel-as-time-machine with the camera wheel's undeveloped futures feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the surreal setting and fragmented structure heightens stakes without sacrificing coherence. The "shared erosion" resolution transforms the expected reconciliation narrative.</comment>
