<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to reconstruct herself from the maps of lost loved ones is clear and compelling, with concrete embodied details like "compass hand" and "sextant eye." Internal contradiction emerges beautifully as she realizes she must become the offering rather than the navigator. The final transformation where she dissolves into the place itself is earned through prior causality, though some emotional transitions could be more granular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught phone calls structuring escalation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist becomes "the geography others would someday try to navigate." The cost is viscerally felt as she literally dissolves ("stitched seams loosened, compass hand spinning free"). Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the reverse migration concept drives consistent pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The signal station functions as both setting and constraint, with its failed hydraulics creating the story's central problem. Sensory details like "cold iron wall" and "oil-stained concrete" ground the surreal elements. The censer foot's weight fluctuations with moon phases constrain choices effectively, and the final white flowers create a haunting closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the three phone calls, each demanding greater sacrifice ("solder copper threads of her own hair," "pack that hollow with sound"). The protagonist's agency drives each choice despite the cryptic instructions. The final dissolution carries undeniable cost as she loses physical form to restore the lost city, though the middle section could tighten slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of reverse migration and bodily dissolution into geography. The final image of flowers that "opened only in starlight, raw solace" offers a non-literal answer about how grief transforms us into landmarks for others. Subtext operates beautifully in the phone calls and the protagonist's gradual understanding of her role as offering.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm that intensifies during transformation sequences ("Weight left her; the stitched seams loosened"). Perceptual signature strong in details like "tremor of the hydraulics die beneath her skin like a final heartbeat." No head-hopping, consistent POV distance, and the experimental elements are pattern-taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the moon was a clipped coin, waning, and the censer foot felt lighter"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful compression. Minor repetition of "raw solace" works as intentional callback. Zero loops or scaffolding, and figurative language enhances rather than obscures peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of a person literally stitched from maps of the departed feels fresh and inevitable. The reverse migration through phone instructions at specific times creates genuine suspense. The transformation of grief into physical geography avoids sentimentality through concrete, surreal imagery that commits fully to its premise.</comment>
