<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Milo's colorblindness drives authentic internal conflict between what he seeks and cannot perceive, with his final acceptance of "the violence of color" earning genuine transformation. Rosa's "innocently cunning" manipulation through the marble eye gift shows layered characterization. However, the middle section's plant arrangement dialogue feels mechanically symbolic rather than embodied, and some emotional beats rely on abstract declaration ("we are most alive where we are broken") rather than dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the phoenix ash-to-garden spiral structure creating resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands with Milo's renunciation of painting as visible cost, and the "bartered awakenings" custom provides causal scaffolding. Minor orientation lag (glassblower relationship unclear until line 4) and the plant arrangement section feels episodic rather than tightly linked, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The courtyard setting actively constrains choices (phoenix ash location, arranged plants as dialogue medium) and the marble eye functions as micro-setting that transforms perception. Vivid sensory work: "reed balanced between his tobacco-stained fingers," "glass dust...fall as colored rain." The glass workshop details authenticate Rosa's expertise though some descriptions edge toward catalog ("wilted orchids, fractured cacti").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Milo's quest to capture impossible color—evolves through the marble eye revelation of "the violence of color" with clear cost (abandoning painting). However, the plant arrangement middle section dissipates pressure into abstraction, and Rosa's agency in orchestrating the transformation reduces Milo's earned discovery. The escalation relies more on accumulation than decisive tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the broken/beautiful paradox, with the reed's transformation and glass-smashing ritual embodying rather than stating meaning. The final image of morning glories growing through the reed strongly reweights earlier destruction. Deduction for explicit thematic declaration "we are most alive where we are broken" that undercuts the otherwise subtle emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("Rosa watched from her furnace door, her innocently cunning smile hidden") and purposeful compression. The POV maintains Milo's limited perception consistently, with Rosa revealed only through external observation. Minor register elevation in philosophical passages ("the courageous act of remaining broken") slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied syntax and strong image density ("vases that warped light into bruised rainbows"). However, template cadence appears in the plant arrangement section, and abstract declarations ("beauty wasn't found in perfection but in the courageous act") replace concrete dramatization. The "Years later" coda adds unnecessary scaffolding to an otherwise complete arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of phoenix mythology with artistic creation/destruction offers fresh perspective, particularly the "bartered awakenings" custom and plant arrangement dialogue system. The specific detail of glass-blown autumn leaves and the marble eye's "trapped starlight" elevates beyond template. Slight derivative feel in the broken/beautiful paradox prevents higher scoring.</comment>
