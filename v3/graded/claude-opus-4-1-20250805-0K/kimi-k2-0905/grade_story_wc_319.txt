<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guardian's transformation from cataloguer to feral protector shows clear motivation through consistent traits, with her method of waiting demonstrating character-specific agency. Her final choice to not cross the boundary but befriend uncertainty shows earned renunciation with visible cost (leaving the pendant). Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("dimensionally homesick") that occasionally drifts from embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught repetition of waiting, boundaries, and transformation that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the guardian chooses companionship with uncertainty over resolution. The cost is visible in leaving the pendant and accepting permanent liminality. The orientation anchors (feral guardian, frozen garden, post-catastrophe world) establish by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen garden functions as both literal setting and constraint—its mist, ice, and rosemary actively shape the guardian's navigation and choices. The boundary threshold becomes the central spatial anchor that enables the final stance. Sensory detail ("breath crystallizing into tiny suspended commas," "rosemary shrubs brittle as old parchment") is selective and POV-filtered through literary metaphor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to cross the boundary or remain—builds through accumulation of waiting rituals and the pendant negotiation. The escalation occurs through deepening understanding that "forcing an entrance only stitched the boundary tighter," leading to the earned choice to befriend rather than resolve. Cost is visible in the abandoned pendant and accepted permanent threshold state.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the guardian's practice of "making friends with uncertainty" without explicit moralizing. The final image of uncertainty as companion rather than stranger resonates backward through all the waiting and non-crossing. The pendant's evolution from cultist tool to offered gift to abandoned object traces thematic development through concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled metaphorical density ("frozen garden," "dimensionally homesick," "foggy lucidity") that maintains consistency throughout. The perceptual signature—seeing library/text metaphors in natural phenomena—is character-specific to the former cataloguer. Minor register elevation in places ("interiorized exteriors") but serves the experimental design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong sentence-level craft with varied rhythm and purposeful compression, though metaphorical density occasionally obscures ("interiorizing exteriors," "exteriorized souls that needed interiorizing exteriors"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some abstract phrasing ("dimensionally homesick for a plane") could be more concrete, but the lyric mode earns most compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of a feral librarian guarding knowledge in a post-catastrophe frozen garden offers fresh synthesis. The transformation of waiting from passive to active method, and uncertainty from enemy to companion, provides non-obvious development. The specific detail of breath becoming "tiny suspended commas" and fur collecting "forgotten marginalia" shows memorable particularity.</comment>
