<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to heal quantified sorrow through ritual deconstruction is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied actions (mapping dreams with chalk, unscrewing brass limbs). The internal conflict between technical repair and mystical understanding plays out through specific choices. Minor deduction for the astronomer's backstory feeling slightly detached from Mara's immediate emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught magical realism (moonlight healing, dream-mapping) that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the sextant transforms into cedar. The closure lands with visible cost: "sorrow index zero" achieved through transmutation of grief into living wood. The pin-drop moment effectively marks the ritual's pivotal turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint and enabler: moonlight heals mortar and enables transformation, the tower's height isolates the ritual, rain and storm provide atmospheric pressure. The dream-grid drawn in chalk becomes micro-setting that constrains where dreams can be caught. Environment directly shapes the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: each mapped dream lowers "ambient sorrow by measurable milligrams" building toward the central transformation. The revelation about trees witnessing human calculations deepens the stakes from repair to understanding. Cost is legible in the transmutation sequence where "numbers peeled off like bark."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transmutation of quantified grief into living matter, avoiding abstract moralizing. The final image of the cedar growing "rings accumulating not sorrow but ordinary time" offers resonant answer to the central question. Subtext operates through the dreams themselves and the unstated parallel between Mara's mother's linden and the new cedar.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends technical precision ("board-foot and beam-length") with lyrical perception ("stones drank the moonlight"). POV control remains stable with selective attention to mystical details fitting a labyrinth worker who discovers magic through maintenance. Perceptual signature strong in how Mara reads dreams as mercury beads.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Lightning forked; for an instant the tower's shadow became a second tower upside-down, rooted in clouds." No loops or scaffolding detected. Figurative language serves the magical realist tone without overwhelming peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of maintenance work with mystical healing offers fresh angle on grief quantification. The specific detail of trees witnessing their own calculated destruction transforms a familiar environmental theme. Risk-taking in the magical realist approach heightens rather than obscures the emotional stakes.</comment>
