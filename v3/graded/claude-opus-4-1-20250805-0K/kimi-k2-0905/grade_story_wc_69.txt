I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, assessing its immediate publishability in elite literary venues.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through sensory accumulation and pattern-teaching toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara's silence becomes the city's root tone.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her transformation from riot-calming choir teacher to silence-keeper. The internal conflict between grief and purpose manifests through embodied action (palms open, kneeling, pressing ear to rosette). Her choice to sacrifice her voice carries visible cost. However, some passages drift toward abstraction ("expectantly resigned" reads more as label than embodied state).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara's silence becomes the city's fundamental tone, with clear cost (her voice sacrificed, rosette crumbling). The accumulative lens holds throughout, building from library stillness to city-wide transformation. The final image of children humming the same scale while the rosette's dust circle remains untouched effectively reweights the opening. Minor deduction for slightly abstract middle passages about "frequencies anger forgets."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The velvet library setting constrains and enables key choices - its equinox visitor rule, the mahogany table as ritual space, moonlight through stained glass charging the final transformation. Sensory detail is rich and purposeful (cedar, candle smoke, saffron, iron, river water). The rosette functions as micro-setting that drinks lamplight and accepts/reflects sound. The untouched dust circle provides perfect spatial closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (unlearning hatred through silence) is signaled early and tightens through Mara's progressive sacrifice - from humming to full voice to permanent silence. The escalation follows the accumulative lens well, with each subtraction building pressure. Cost is visible in the rosette crumbling and Mara never singing again. Slightly abstract in places ("frequencies anger forgets") but the pattern coheres.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the paradox of subtraction creating harmony - vanishing arts waiting in negative space. The final image of children humming offers a non-literal answer to how hatred dissolves. The concept that "enemy" becomes a note that "simply did not belong" resonates without moralizing. Strong integration of silence as both absence and presence throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("traveled stillness," "velvet turned inside out"). POV remains stable in close third. The perceptual signature is consistent - focusing on sound, silence, and resonance. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("expectantly resigned" appears twice as prompt-echo), but rhythm control under pressure is strong, especially in the ritual sequences.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high, with most lines doing multiple jobs. However, "expectantly resigned" appears twice (prompt artifact), and some passages lean abstract ("frequencies anger forgets," "negative space"). The paraphrase "expectantly resigned, knowing" appears in two different contexts. Strong opening and closing lines partially compensate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of unlearning hatred through sonic subtraction is fresh and specific. The synthesis of library as ritual space, inherited rosette as vessel, and silence as active force feels organic. The transformation from choir teacher to silence-keeper offers a non-obvious angle. Minor deduction for "expectantly resigned" reading as template language from the prompt.</comment>
