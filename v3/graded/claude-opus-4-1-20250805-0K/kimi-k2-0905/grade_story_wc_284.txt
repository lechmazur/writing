<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The burned spy's internal contradiction between former prudence and current daring drives meaningful choices, particularly in destroying the pillbox and transmitting despite personal cost. His physical scars embody psychological transformation, though some introspection edges toward over-articulation ("planting secrets they never see blossom"). The final choice to walk among commuters with "scar tissue pulling tight as if smiling" shows earned change through specific embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from discovering the pillbox code through transmission to walking away transformed. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the spy's acceptance of his burned identity and the "signal still traveled, snow-soft and relentless." Cost is visible in destroying the pillbox (severing his past) and accepting permanent exile. Minor orientation delay with "Sera" introduced before her role clarifies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cliff path, accumulated snow, and hidden station effectively constrain choices and enable the plot's resolution. The snowdrop blooming through slate provides a precise natural image that charges the ending without forced symbolism. Some descriptive phrases lean purple ("silver hush of responsibility") but the setting consistently pressures action through physical obstacles and weather conditions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal survival to exposing corruption that destroyed "four undercover teams," with the spy accepting self-destruction ("destroy him a second time") to fix others' broken lives. The dominant stake—redemption through sacrifice—tightens when he crushes the pillbox, foreclosing return to his old life. Cost is legible in permanent exile and accepting his burned status.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of courage found through accepting brokenness emerges organically through action rather than declaration. The snowdrop and transmission create resonant answers to "where unused courage waits" without stating morals. However, Sera's quoted wisdom about "gardeners of possible futures" and some internal philosophizing ("spies are gardeners") edge toward thematic articulation rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("the moon a thin blade above the fog") and consistent perceptual signature focused on tactile details and weather. POV remains stable with appropriate access to the spy's damaged interiority. Some phrases drift toward writerly register ("vouchsafed another legend") that slightly exceeds the character's established lexicon under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied sentence structure and effective rhythm modulation during key beats. Information density is high with most lines advancing multiple story functions. However, several instances of elevated diction ("silver hush of responsibility," "zephyr curling") and near-repetition of "silver hush" create mild purple patches. The "gardeners of possible futures" metaphor strains slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle on spy fiction through focus on post-burn recovery and the specific detail of codes in snow patterns. The integration of physical and moral "burning" with redemption through self-exposure transforms familiar espionage tropes. The snowdrop as courage-receiver and the final image of walking among commuters with healing scars offers memorable specificity beyond genre conventions.</comment>
