<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Foresight Hindsight Only embodies contradictory impulses through her existence between future and past, with the final choice to dissolve into the storm earned through prior exploration of path/walker interdependence. The wafer seal melting into her skin creates embodied stakes, and her transformation shows genuine cost as she loses physical form. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around the Council of Continuities that lacks grounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught dissolution culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she becomes the storm's path. The wafer seal's transformation from control device to "lullaby" and the bunker's metamorphosis into growing corridors create visible cost. The ending image of travelers finding upward rain successfully reweights the opening's decay directive into "freedom remembering its first shape."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bunker's "precisely playful" architecture that negotiates its own escape constrains choices effectively, with dripping water forming melodies and the lens-roof channeling storm/lightning. The rewilded forest and vine-draped metal create atmospheric pressure. Setting actively participates in transformation, though some descriptions lean abstract ("corridors are precisely playful").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative deepening: seal warming → melting into skin → projecting directives → flaring with final clause. The storm's approach creates temporal pressure, and her dissolution carries unmistakable cost as "lightning unthreads her name." The path/walker question receives a costly answer through her consent to "being worn smooth."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The path/walker paradox emerges organically through concrete images (footprints walking away, storm climbing stairs that dissolve). The decay directive's transformation from control to freedom, and the final revelation that "walkers and paths are one another's becoming" reweights all prior material. Strong thematic resonance without moralizing, earned through the protagonist's dissolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric compression ("The storm approaches like a memory of thunder"). Some elevated diction fits the ethereal tone though occasionally drifts toward abstraction. The perceptual signature of existing only in the instant creates unique focalization. Minor register inconsistencies but rhythm control heightens pressure effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong opening/closing lines. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some abstract phrasing reduces clarity ("precisely playful," "ethereal grit") and occasional filter constructions ("she sees," "she understands"). The lyric mode maintains momentum despite compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ecological rewilding with data decay creates an original premise. The bunker as living architecture that "negotiates its own escape" and the protagonist existing only between future/past show genuine invention. Risk-taking through the dissolution ending and upward rain image heightens stakes. Within-band bonus of +0.3 for unconventional structural choices that serve the accumulative design.</comment>
