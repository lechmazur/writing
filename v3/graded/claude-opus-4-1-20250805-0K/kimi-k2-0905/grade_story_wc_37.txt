<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong characterization through embodied perception and concrete internal conflict, particularly the keeper's fragmented memories manifesting as physical sensations ("moths against glass," mica shards driven into ribs). The transformation from scattered to coherent identity earns its weight through accumulated cost, though some moments edge toward abstraction ("tuning fork struck at the heart").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the greenhouse transforms from dying to luminous through collective song. Cost is visceral (blood mingling with mica, scarred ribs) and the pattern of memory-recovery-to-communal-healing lands cleanly, though the multiple overlapping orchards revelation feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building where setting actively constrains and enables choices—the alchemical orchard's quicksilver dreams, grafted pomegranates that chime, and tarry vines that attack song. The mirror world concept charges every image and the greenhouse functions as both literal space and metaphysical heart.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (recovering memories) to communal (restoring the realm) with clear tightening when tarry vines attack and the mica window shatters. The revelation about mirrors refusing to reflect each other's light meaningfully reframes the conflict, and cost accumulates through physical pain and memory-bleeding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of isolation/community and fragmentation/coherence, culminating in the insight that collective singing heals what individual amnesia broke. The final image of communities teaching children preservative songs resonates without moralizing, and the keeper letting villagers keep her name adds thematic depth about mystery versus revelation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("dawns not born but woven," "night had clotted") that occasionally tips into opacity. POV remains stable and the perceptual signature—focusing on alchemical transformation and synaesthetic detail—stays consistent, though some constructions feel overwrought ("bound release, pain become portal").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with strong rhythmic variation and purposeful compression, but figurative density occasionally obscures clarity ("quicksilver dreams," "audible light"). Some passages achieve exceptional integration ("fruits burst open, releasing not seeds but voices") while others strain under their own weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of mirror-world mythology with memory-as-community concept, executed through specific alchemical imagery rather than generic fantasy. The transformation of lullaby into architectural restoration and the idea of woven dawns needing communal song to pattern them shows genuine imaginative risk that pays off.</comment>
