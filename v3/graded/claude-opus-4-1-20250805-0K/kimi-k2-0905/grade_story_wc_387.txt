<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's philosophical stance and net-mending practice create a consistent character whose discovery of the whisk inscription validates her belief system through embodied action. Her internal experience layers contradictory impulses (mourning the object vs. understanding its invisible labor), though some passages drift toward abstract meditation rather than concrete struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the protagonist's search for the whisk culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when she discovers the inscription matches her walked pattern. The closure lands with conceptual cost—understanding that invisible acts create paths others follow—though the physical discovery feels slightly convenient despite the earned thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The parapet setting actively shapes the protagonist's movements and discovery, with fireflies, moon paths, and harbor details creating a lived-in nocturnal world. The whispering stones and their heat/chill contrast constrain her navigation, while the final image of moon paths on black water charges the closure with sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—appreciating hidden effort—deepens through the protagonist's spiral walk and whisk discovery, with the inscription revelation reweighting her understanding of invisible labor. The oarsman's course change provides external validation, though the escalation relies more on accumulative resonance than decisive pressure points.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of invisible labor creating navigable paths emerges through concrete particulars: net-mending, the grandmother's whisk carving, firefly patterns, and the oarsman's changed course. The final image of "knot after knot, each tiny restoration a whistle only the sea could hear" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The philosophical voice maintains consistent elevation with controlled rhythm and distinctive perceptual signatures ("sandals leaving dark commas," "fireflies drifted between masts, stitching green light"). The meditative register occasionally drifts toward abstraction but recovers through concrete sensory anchoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some passages contain near-paraphrase loops ("hidden patterns reveal themselves"/"the invisible labor inside it"/"every invisible act"). The prose maintains strong rhythm variety and sensory specificity, but philosophical abstractions occasionally slow momentum in mid-story beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of Eastern philosophy with maritime labor creates a fresh angle on craftsmanship-as-wisdom narratives. The specific detail of the whisk's inscription being "a spiral of tiny moons, each no larger than a needle's eye" that matches the protagonist's unconscious walking pattern shows originality in linking physical and metaphysical patterns.</comment>
