I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through layered images of preservation, displacement, and cultural transmission rather than strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aurelia's transformation from cataloguing disappearance to participating in living culture is earned through concrete encounters with the Chen family. The contradiction between her cultured preservation instinct and the refugees' active transmission drives genuine change. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("her heart broke") rather than fully embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: Aurelia shifts from preserving artifacts behind glass to breaking and sharing bread, with visible cost in abandoning her curator identity. The accumulative structure coheres through the bread-making motif and museum transformation. Minor orientation delay (grotto city context emerges gradually) doesn't harm closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto city and waterfall create genuine spatial pressure—the melted ice bridges isolate the community, forcing internal transformation. The museum's limestone chambers and education center become active spaces. The opera glass lens shifting from emerald-tinted to clear nicely charges the final revelation, though some transitions between spaces could be cleaner.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving culture amid displacement—intensifies from passive cataloguing to active transmission. The Chen family's commandeering of the education center meaningfully tightens options. Cost is visible in Aurelia's abandoned curator role and the community's acceptance that "rescue wasn't something that arrived from outside."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the bread-shaping tradition and the opera glass clearing—culture as living practice versus preserved artifact. "Maybe we're rescuing you from forgetting" reweights the entire rescue dynamic. The final image of art as "lifeboat" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aurelia's cultured voice modulates effectively from formal observation to participatory warmth. Some register elevation feels unmotivated ("alchemy of displacement and determination"). Dialogue from Chen family members carries authentic weight, though limited dialogue overall prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("tapestries draped over stalagmites like frozen waterfalls of memory"). However, abstract phrases accumulate ("the alchemy of displacement and determination," "immortal, rising like bread") and some sentences run long without proportional payoff. The "rosewater dread" dream sequence feels disconnected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of museum preservation with refugee displacement, transformed through the specific detail of bread-shaping traditions. The opera glass lens clearing as metaphor for seeing culture differently is earned. The reversal—refugees rescuing the curator—feels both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
