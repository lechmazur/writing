<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's journey from isolation to belonging is earned through concrete micro-choices: touching the arbor despite doubt, following the heron tag, and proposing to mark deeper territory. The internal contradiction between her desire for community and her inability to feel kinship threads drives authentic tension, though some emotional transitions (particularly the rapid shift to leadership at the end) could use more gradual scaffolding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira discovers kinship is "forged" rather than inherited, with visible cost in her physical buckling and the effort of her three-night journey. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details (chiming crystals, mercury tags, moonstone paths) build toward the revelation that "community was not a place but a procession." Minor orientation delay (who Lira is takes time to clarify) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard functions as more than setting—it actively shapes choices through its chiming tones, gravity shifts, and the obsidian arbor that requires breath-dedication for entry. The contrast between marsh-reed textures and crystalline surfaces reinforces Lira's transformation, and the crater's bowl shape creates natural convergence for seekers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of belonging escalates from solitary arrival through collaborative search to collective action, with the mercury tag serving as catalyst for connection. The cost is legible when Lira's knees buckle under the "boldly sympathetic weight," though the final shift to leadership ("Let's add another heron") could benefit from more intermediate pressure to feel fully earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically through the contrast between inherited "webs of kinship" (reed-bending patterns) and forged connections (shared search, witness acts). The heron motif accumulates meaning from tag to constellation to Lira's own glyph, and the final image of "seeker and signpost" resonantly answers the belonging question without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with controlled syntax ("her calloused fingers still smelling of peat and sap") and effective free indirect style. However, register occasionally drifts toward abstract philosophy ("community was not a place but a procession") that slightly exceeds Lira's established lexicon as a marsh-reed sculptor, and dialogue between the twins lacks distinct characterization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong sensory specificity ("quicksilver that stayed wet for days," "crushed moonstone forked") with varied sentence structures. Deductions for abstract register drift in peak moments ("boldly sympathetic ache," "luminescent ache"), some template repetition ("She pressed," "She stepped," "She turned"), and occasional overwriting that prioritizes lyricism over clarity ("beyond the murmur of lost languages").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of artistic creation (reed sculptor seeking street artist) with community-building offers fresh perspective on belonging narratives. The specific detail of mercury tags that stay wet for days and form constellations when touched transforms a potentially generic search plot, though the resolution's philosophical articulation prevents full originality.</comment>
