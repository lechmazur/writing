<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's character progression from skeptical artist to healer is earned through concrete discovery, with her "affectionate skepticism" consistently coloring her actions. The motivation feels authentic, though some interior passages lean toward exposition rather than embodied contradiction (e.g., "Now she understood why..."). Her final choice to help others carries visible cost in transforming her private studio into a public sanctuary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear causal chain from static shock → discovery → solution → community healing, with the telepathy crisis providing meaningful stakes. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira's studio transforms from refuge to beacon, with cost visible in her sacrifice of privacy. The extensive backstory about the pill recall (lines 4-8) slightly dilutes present-scene momentum but does anchor the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The light painting studio functions well as micro-setting, with projectors and mirrors constraining Mira's discovery process. The muscovite geode's physical properties (layering, mica vibrations) directly enable the solution. However, spatial choreography occasionally floats, and sensory detail beyond visual could strengthen key moments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal discovery to community healing, with the static shock serving as meaningful inciting incident. The tightening occurs when Mira realizes she can help the pill victims, narrowing her options to either remain private or sacrifice her sanctuary. Cost is visible in the transformation of her private space, though intermediate obstacles could heighten pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between connection and privacy, with the geode serving as both map and shield. The final image of combining "ancient minerals with modern understanding" resonates without moralizing. "Willowglass hope" evolving to "something stronger" tracks the emotional arc effectively, though some passages edge toward thematic statement rather than embodied revelation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with scientific precision ("fractally precise patterns") appropriate to Mira's character. POV control is stable, though some passages drift toward omniscient summary ("Word spread quickly"). The perceptual signature could be more distinct—Mira as light artist should notice visual details more idiosyncratically.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful scientific diction, but several template patterns emerge: "Mira [verb], her [noun] [verb]-ing" appears repeatedly. Information density is moderate—many sentences do single duty. The phrase "fractally precise" appears four times without evolving meaning, suggesting synonym avoidance rather than purposeful repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of telepathy crisis with light-based healing offers genuine freshness, avoiding typical psychic shield tropes. The specific use of muscovite's physical properties to disrupt mental signals shows creative problem-solving. The transformation from art studio to healing sanctuary provides an unexpected but earned resolution to the telepathy problem.</comment>
