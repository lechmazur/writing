<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The titan's motivation is clear and rooted in cosmic balance rather than personal revenge, with his "regally unpretentious" nature manifesting in concrete actions like leaving cryptic marginalia and moving with "footfalls softer than parchment breath." The pretender's character arc from false monarch to exposed stranger is earned through the iron gall ink's causal sundering, though the titan himself remains somewhat static as an agent of precision rather than a character with internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain: titan searches for rune → leaves cryptic messages → pretender arrives → ink pellet awakens → glamour sunders, with visible cost as the pretender loses not just the throne but his very identity ("a stranger wearing ambition for a crown, now stripped even of that"). The Decisive Change lands on-page with the glamour's unraveling and the library's "graceful collapse" response, though the titan's departure feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient temple library constrains action through its "leaning shelves," "spiral carrel," and "cracked portico," with spatial choreography clear as the titan descends to whisper his second clue. The setting actively participates in the closure with "rafters leaning closer to witness" and "shelves an inch closer to the earth," though some details like "stone lions" feel ornamental rather than essential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from the titan's centuries-long search through the pretender's arrival to the moment of exposure, with the iron gall ink creating irreversible consequences ("dissolving back into a drop of liquid night"). The cost is legible as the pretender loses his borrowed identity completely, and the titan's patient tactics (cryptic messages building a sequential map) demonstrate agency driving the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of drift, balance, and truth, with the final message "Truth drifts until someone chooses to anchor it" offering a resonant non-literal answer to questions of legitimacy and power. The library's physical response and the dust motes forming a dissolving coronet create meaning through image rather than statement, though some metaphysical concepts ("vertigo of being unmoored from one's own epoch") occasionally drift toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent elevation with distinctive phrases like "candlelight moving like moonlit alabaster" and "footfalls softer than parchment breath," though occasional register drift appears ("monarchical entitlement"). POV remains stable in omniscient mode with controlled access to both titan and pretender's perspectives, and the prose rhythm modulates effectively during the climactic sundering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery ("iron gall ink pellet no wider than a mite"), though some phrases edge toward overwriting ("brocade of borrowed starlight unraveling"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements, but occasional abstraction ("where words forget their meaning") and slight repetition of "regally unpretentious" create minor drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a diminutive titan using library marginalia to expose a false king offers genuine freshness, transforming the David-and-Goliath trope through specific details like iron gall ink's chemical properties. The story's commitment to its premise of cosmic balance maintained through patient bibliographic intervention creates a memorable synthesis, though the resolution's tidiness prevents full risk-taking.</comment>
