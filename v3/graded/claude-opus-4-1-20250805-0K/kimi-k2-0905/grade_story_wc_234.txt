<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses act simultaneously in Corin's struggle between commercializing vs. honoring presence, with the final choice to crush the pocket-sun earned through prior causality. Minor deduction for Mira's "directed spontaneity" phrase which edges toward diagnostic label-speak but is quickly embodied through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the crushed pocket-sun transforms their relationship and reweights Corin's entire practice with visible cost (destroying his creation). The shell's transformation from gift to question to shared presence tracks causally. Minor orientation wobble in the opening but recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ember nexus actively constrains choices (secret meeting place, volcanic glass heat) and the nautilus shell functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, particularly the "glowing fissures" and glass that "sings."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing presence vs. preserving absence) signaled early and tightens through Corin's confession, with the crushing of the pocket-sun foreclosing his old path. The cost is visible but the middle section could apply more pressure before the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of preservation killing presence, with the shell's transformation offering a non-literal answer about sharing vs. capturing. The final image of "never been captured, only shared" resonantly reweights all prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Corin's scientific-romantic lens ("measuring love in milligrams") with controlled psychic distance shifts. Some register drift into elevated diction ("elastic as caramel," "palette of resolve") that occasionally strains against the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but several instances of overwriting ("directed spontaneity," "scientifically romantic paradox") and mild template cadence in dialogue tags. The filter-verb stack around "understanding" and "knowing" dulls immediacy in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The pocket-sun alchemist concept offers a fresh angle on memory preservation, and the specific synthesis of scientific measurement with romantic yearning feels earned. The transformation from selling to releasing light shows genuine risk-taking, though some elements feel slightly derivative of familiar fantasy tropes.</comment>
