<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to rebuild faith through physical and spiritual excavation drives consistent choices from kneeling at the skull to teaching the hymn. Internal contradiction between exile's pull and island gravity creates authentic tension. The caretaker boy's transformation from suspicious observer to participant adds secondary pressure. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around faith that lacks full embodiment in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where rebuilding the prayer house transforms both landscape and community, with visible cost in permanent exile from wandering. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details (sundial, bones, hymns) layer toward the final image of cemented permanence. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2. Deduction for slight causality softness in how exactly the sundial mechanics trigger the wood's reassembly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard brilliantly functions as both setting and constraint—roots threading through bones guide the path, skulls become drums, vertebrae serve as sundial platforms. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("myrrh-scented air," "oxidized copper eyes"). The environment actively shapes choices and enables the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal return to communal restoration, with the sundial's shadow literally rebuilding the burned prayer house as the meaningful tightening. Cost is visible in choosing permanence over wandering ("never left the island again"). The roots' movement and bones' approval add textural pressure. Minor deduction for the magical reassembly arriving somewhat conveniently despite poetic setup.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of interrupted journeys resuming through patient excavation and rebuilding. The final image of the sundial "cemented into the chapel floor" resonantly answers whether return means robbery or rebuilding. Subtext operates through objects (mirrors showing fractured generations) and silence. Slight deduction for the overly explicit final clause about faith being rebuilt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled register mixing archaeological precision ("reliquary of brass mirrors") with mystical perception ("faith that had collapsed"). POV remains stable and filters detail through returnee's expertise. Dialogue is minimal but effective ("Are you here to rebuild or to rob?"). Deduction for occasional register elevation that strains against the established voice and some filter-verb clustering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations and strong information density. Vivid specific imagery ("fossilized petals," "melted bell metal"). However, several instances of elevated diction strain clarity ("cautious enchantment thick as honey") and some near-paraphrase loops around faith/rebuilding concepts. The final paragraph contains unnecessary abstraction that could be cut without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of diaspora return narrative with archaeological resurrection and living architecture shows genuine originality. The specific detail of bones becoming drums and roots creating living arches transforms familiar return-home tropes. The conceit of interrupted journeys that can resume "if given a shadow to follow" offers fresh insight into exile and belonging.</comment>
