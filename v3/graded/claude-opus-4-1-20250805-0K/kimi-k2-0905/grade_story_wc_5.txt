<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's embodied patience and grief-driven motivation create genuine internal contradiction between his explosive nature and enforced stillness. His choice to remain as guardian/translator at closure carries visible cost—abandoning the search for his lover to become part of the orchard's pattern. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around memory and absence that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through Resonant Reconfiguration: the alchemist transforms from seeker to guardian with clear cost (forsaking his quest). The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and pays off through density increase and the final image of him conducting heartbeats while "the world holds its breath forever." Orientation anchors (alchemist, orchard, crater) establish by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The withered orchard and copper plate actively constrain choices—the alchemist must work in silence to avoid igniting flash-paper, and the crater's geography shapes his mapping. The final image of trees as drums and the orchard as "living score" directly charges closure. Sensory detail filters through his specific attention to heartbeats and patterns.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from searching to finding to fusing to choosing guardianship. The cost is legible—he "knew he would never leave" and accepts permanent separation from his lover. The dominant stake (translating grief into meaning) tightens when he discovers the plate can create the map but requires his permanent presence as listener.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of heartbeats into maps, loss into pattern-making. The final image of the alchemist as "keeper of the moving stillness" resonantly answers the central question about preserving love through absence without stating a moral. His role shift from seeker to guide for "future lost travelers" reweights all prior searching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through the alchemist's attention to rhythms, patterns, and careful movements. Some elevated diction ("safekept starlight," "moving stillness") fits the lyric mode but occasionally drifts toward purple prose. The repetition of "while the world holds its breath" works as taught pattern but risks becoming mannered.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm variations and high information density. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("the flash-paper alchemist, whose fingers once sparked wildfire") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("frequencies only absence can tune"). The piece maintains momentum despite dense figurative language, though some metaphors strain clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy, cartography, and grief offers a non-obvious angle on loss. The specific detail of flash-paper sensitivity creating enforced stillness is inventive. However, the core premise of translating heartbeats into maps, while poetic, doesn't fully escape abstraction into lived specificity.</comment>
