<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Posy's motivation to preserve memory through sound-capturing is consistently embodied through concrete actions, from sweeping pennies "not for bread, but for the toll" to her methodical jar-labeling system. The child's request crystallizes into Posy's final choice to open the music box, earning the closure through accumulated particulars rather than sudden insight. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("lonesome splendor," "gleaned redemption") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the music box projects "We are still becoming" and the community begins humming "the same new-old chord," with cost visible in Posy's years of patient collection and the child's copper seeds as "invitations." The accumulative lens holds as density increases through layered sounds until the final convergence. Slight deduction for the convenience of the child's perfectly-timed arrival, though it serves the thematic arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hull-plank cathedral with its "salt-bleached arches" and shelves of glimmering jars creates a lived-in sacred space that constrains Posy's choices—she must work within found materials and the music box's rust-sealed resistance. The "apricot salt" air and "soft collapse of a dune, sighing like a grandparent" provide selective sensory detail that charges the final image of collective humming.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving generational memory before it dissolves—tightens when the child requests something Posy doesn't have ("I want my children to hear what my great-grandmother sounded like"), forcing her to act on faith rather than certainty. Cost is visible in the years of patient collecting and the risk of opening the sealed box. The resolution feels slightly convenient with the box's magical projection, limiting higher scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of memory as collective inheritance emerges through concrete particulars: jars containing "mother's final laugh," the music box as refugee artifact, and pennies transformed from currency to "invitations." The final image of community humming "the same new-old chord" offers a non-literal answer about continuity through shared becoming rather than perfect preservation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with distinctive constructions like "bones humming with the lonesome splendor" and "the gleaned redemption she sought brush her ribs like a cat asking to be named." The perceptual signature is selective and poetic, though occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("liturgy," "holographic") that slightly strains the vagrant poet's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("kelp-stitched blankets," "squinting ink") and varied rhythm, but contains scattered overwrought moments: "lonesome splendor" appears twice, "gleaned redemption" feels forced, and some metaphors strain ("brush her ribs like a cat asking to be named"). The density of figurative language in emotional beats occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of sound-jarring as memory preservation offers a fresh angle on generational trauma and inheritance, with specific details like "the hiss of the last steam train" and the music box's transformation from sealed artifact to communal projector. The vagrant poet as memory-keeper avoiding commercialization ("memory should never be for sale") adds originality, though the magical resolution feels somewhat expected.</comment>
