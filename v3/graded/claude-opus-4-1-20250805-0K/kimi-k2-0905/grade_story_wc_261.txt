I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through lyric density and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist finally achieves closure through embodied transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's wound-reading journey shows clear internal contradiction between seeking closure and fearing it, with the final seed-swallowing creating genuine transformation. The telepathic plant voices and bleeding/healing cycle embody emotion concretely. Deduction for occasional abstraction ("closure," "stories in scars") that could be more embodied, though the physical acts of bleeding and rooting ground most key moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the protagonist transforms the wound from "question mark" to "period" through the seed-swallowing, with clear cost (blood offering, reopened wound). The accumulative lens holds as images (hourglass, coffee rings, wound) layer and reweight. Minor deduction for the abstract "displaced miracle" mechanics that strain clarity, though the emotional arc remains legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tower setting constrains choice through its buried miracle and telepathic plants, with coffee rings becoming a literal portal. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (iron/lilac taste, meteor hush). The underground rooting sequence uses phosphorescent xylem effectively. Some spatial choreography wavers during the descent/ascent transition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes center on releasing the miracle through reopening the wound, with clear cost ("Trade requires fresh loss"). The blood offering and scar-reading create meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. The transformation from bleeding wound to swallowed seed shows agency, though the miracle's displacement mechanics remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the wound-as-story metaphor ("scars are simply stories written sideways"), avoiding explicit moralizing. The sister's laugh recurring through plant telepathy creates resonance. The final transformation from question mark to period offers a non-literal answer about grief and acceptance. Slight elevation for the organic emergence through concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with selective attention to medical/botanical detail (xylem, phloem, sutures). Voice modulates effectively from clinical observation to lyric immersion during the rooting sequence. The plant telepathy creates interesting focalization shifts while maintaining POV control. Minor repetition in abstract phrases ("displaced miracle") that could vary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly lands ("frosted hourglass," "meteor hush," "vertebra in the spine of memory") with good information density. Deduction for occasional abstraction loops around "miracle" and "closure" concepts, plus some register elevation during peak moments ("chlorophyll code," "cellulose thread") that strains the established voice. Prose rhythm varies effectively between sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The plant telepathy accident and wound-reading through coffee rings offer fresh angles on grief processing. The physical literalization of metaphor (actually rooting underground, wounds as readable texts) transforms familiar material. The seed-swallowing resolution feels earned rather than convenient. Some derivative elements in the sister-loss backstory, but the treatment through botanical consciousness is distinctive.</comment>
