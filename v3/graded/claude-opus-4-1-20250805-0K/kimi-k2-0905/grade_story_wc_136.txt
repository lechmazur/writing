<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alden's transformation from obsessive mapper to authentic artist is earned through concrete sensory details (the warm punch, chest-clicking confessions) and embodied contradictions. The progression from "I left because I was afraid of color" to painting with his own ultramarine blood creates genuine cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "analytically artistic" that could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught magical realism paying off in a Decisive Change where Alden literally punches out his silences and paints his first honest line. The transformation from phantom tool to paint creates visible cost (the ultramarine sigil on his chest). Slight dock for the convenience of the tunnel appearing exactly when needed, though the 3:07 timing helps motivate this.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The phantom punch and glowing pavement cracks constrain choices effectively, with the tunnel's cedar-mist creating atmospheric pressure. The fortress of stacked journals/canvases charges the final transformation. Some generic descriptors ("starlit vault in mist" repeated verbatim) prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating confessions that literally light compartments, with each punch releasing trapped words creating irreversible forward momentum. The cost is visceral—punching his own chest to release silences. The single-beat structure maintains coherent pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of unvoiced truths as physical spaces/objects, culminating in "Speak or be spoken for." The transformation of the punch into paint beautifully reweights the artistic suppression without moralizing. The recurring time markers (3:07/4:07) subtly reinforce the threshold theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with pattern-taught repetitions ("analytically artistic," "trembling certainty") that pay off thematically. The lyrical compression works but occasionally tips into purple prose ("starlit throat," "fortress of unspoken truths"). Clean POV control throughout with appropriate psychic distance shifts during the confession sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with strong moments ("each clack echoed backward into his past, punching holes in memories he had stapled shut"). However, several template repetitions harm momentum: "starlit vault in mist" appears verbatim three times, "cracks in pavement forming arrows" four times, "trembling certainty" twice. The repeated phrases create a loop effect that dulls impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The phantom punch as confession-extractor and the fortress built from unspoken art is conceptually fresh. The physical act of punching out silences to create paint transforms the expected metaphor. Some elements feel workshopped (the 3:07 "hour that divides bad habits"), but the synthesis of route-mapping and artistic suppression feels specific.</comment>
