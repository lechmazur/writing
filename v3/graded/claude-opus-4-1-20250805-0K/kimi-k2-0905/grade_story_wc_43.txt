<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation through "decisively kind" actions and her father's vinyl shard creates consistent character pressure. The pairing of professional duty with personal grief drives authentic choices, particularly in how she transforms ordinary sounds into comfort. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("reunify does not mean repair") in the final beat, though it's partially earned through the dramatized vinyl reunion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the broken/reunited vinyl crystallizes Mara's understanding that wholeness includes carrying fragments forward. The accumulative lens holds as mundane sounds layer into meaning, with visible cost in Calderon's death and the daughter's grief. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (hospice context emerges gradually) though it serves the dreamlike atmosphere.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cloud-level hospice with glass floors creates distinctive atmosphere, and sensory details (petrichor indoors, cumulus cities) enhance the liminal space between life and death. The vinyl shard functions as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image. Deduction for some vague spatial choreography in the skybridge sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Central stake of "flawless goodbye" escalates through Mara's kalimba performance transforming hospital sounds into a death lullaby, with Calderon's passing as the decisive cost. The daughter's arrival deepens emotional stakes. Minor weakness in that the conflict lacks resistance—everything proceeds too smoothly toward resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The broken/reunited vinyl metaphor resonates powerfully with grief and wholeness, earning its thematic weight through concrete action rather than declaration. "Reunify does not mean repair; it means carry both pieces forward" emerges from dramatized discovery. The final image of the reassembled-but-still-broken record offers a non-literal answer to loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical compression ("Monday the color of dishwater," "silence to grow teeth") and controlled psychic distance. Clean POV management throughout. Deduction for occasional register elevation that strains against the intimate moment ("glowing organism," "pulsing stillness") and slightly overwrought metaphors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong moments of compression and imagery, but figurative density occasionally overwhelms clarity ("borrowed time from the air," "chord that spelled stay, then later, go"). Some template phrasing in transitions ("Mara left," "She walked," "She paused"). Information density is high but momentum occasionally stalls in descriptive passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of music therapy, broken objects as hope symbols, and death-as-incomplete-reunification offers fresh perspective on hospice narrative. The specific detail of "hymning the mundane" by transforming hospital sounds into music shows genuine ingenuity. Slight deduction for familiar grief-counselor-with-personal-loss framework.</comment>
