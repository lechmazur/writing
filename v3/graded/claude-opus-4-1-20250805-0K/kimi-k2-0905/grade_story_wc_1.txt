<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to find meaning in stillness rather than revenge drives credible choices throughout, with internal contradictions embodied in physical details like "breath on cracked glass." The final renunciation of the smuggling path for teaching others who survived fire shows earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("discover purpose in the pauses") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the artist transforms from fugitive to teacher, with cost visible in the charcoal line "printing a ghost that faded mile by mile." The accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns build through glass beads, frost readings, and the obsidian shard to create density that reweights her stance. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2-3 with who/where/when established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canyon functions as both physical constraint and psychological crucible, with walls narrowing "until sky became a blade of starlight" forcing introspection. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered through the artist's craft lens ("frost silvered the ground like her own imperfect glazing"). The obsidian shard and glass beads constrain choices and charge the final teaching image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation follows accumulative deepening as each discovery (ledger decoding, frost patterns, campfire circle, obsidian shard) adds texture that forces stance crystallization. The dominant stake of finding purpose over revenge tightens when she discovers other glass artists were silenced, forcing the choice between pursuit and retreat. Cost is visible in crushing the ledger and accepting the bus driver's ignorance of the shard's value.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete motif of pauses/stillness versus action, with the final studio offering "quiet hours at dawn" answering the central question without stating a moral. The resonant ending where "nothing and no one would be erased again" reweights all prior erasure attempts. Subtext operates effectively through the obsidian shard exchange and the blank route sign.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through glass-making metaphors ("breath on cracked glass," "floating sparks," "world was a blank gather of molten light"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance that tightens during discovery moments. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("drifting resonance," "scorched testament") that slightly exceeds the character's established register under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in the canyon sequence where each image advances both external journey and internal transformation. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("flames licking rafters like wolves tasting blood") without clear pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears briefly ("She knelt...She pocketed...She understood") but doesn't pervade closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of glass artistry with smuggling investigation offers a non-obvious angle, particularly the transformation from victim to teacher of other fire survivors. The specific detail of reading smuggler movements in frost patterns and using failed vase fragments as trail markers shows originality. The quiet ending that refuses revenge for teaching represents meaningful risk-taking that heightens thematic stakes.</comment>
