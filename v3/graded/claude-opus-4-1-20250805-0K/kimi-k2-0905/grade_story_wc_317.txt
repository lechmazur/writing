grade_story_wc_317.txt
I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Inferred Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through density of fantastical imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the building becomes self-writing.

<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her receptivity to the seed's influence creates genuine tension. However, the transformation lacks embodied emotional cost - she accepts the building's mutation too readily without internal contradiction. The final smile undermines the weight of becoming "puzzle and planter alike."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands (building becomes self-writing) but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The time-loop setup with tomorrow's note creates intriguing causality, yet the resolution lacks visible sacrifice. The orientation anchors arrive clearly but the fantastical escalation strains credibility without sufficient grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The escape room setting actively constrains choices - Mira must plant beneath the glass floor, the only untouched soil. The mill's architecture becomes character through "corridors lined with false doors, mirror mazes, and gears that clicked like anxious teeth." The reversed brook effectively charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stakes emerge clearly (rooms will trap people) but escalation relies on fantastical transformation rather than character agency. Mira's sprint to redirect growth shows some agency, but the resolution depends on the seed's autonomous power. The guests solving riddles provides texture without raising personal cost for Mira.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of innovation needing refuge emerges organically through the building's transformation. The corpse flower subverts expectations - revealing light rather than rot. The concept of spaces that "mutate together, orthogonal to time" offers genuine resonance, though the final paragraph edges toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical density with distinctive phrases like "storm-born silence" and "vegetal pulse." The prose texture suits the fantastical premise. Some register elevation ("orthogonal approaches to revelation") occasionally strains against the intimate POV, but rhythm control during the transformation sequence is strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose density overwhelms at times - nearly every sentence contains figurative language without sufficient breathing room. Mixed metaphors appear ("gills" for walls, then "pollinators" for guests). However, the opening and closing images bookend effectively, and syntactic variety maintains momentum through the transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of an escape room that becomes self-aware and self-writing is genuinely fresh. The reversal of the corpse flower's symbolism (light instead of decay) and the time-loop note create original tension. The concept of guests as unwitting pollinators spreading puzzle-seeds is inventive.</comment>
