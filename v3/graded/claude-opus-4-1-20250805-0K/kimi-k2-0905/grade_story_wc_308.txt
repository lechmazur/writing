<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cael's motivation is clear and rooted in ancestral memory, with the grandmother's arrowhead serving as both physical and emotional anchor. The piece successfully embodies his transformation through concrete sensory details (teeth aching from resonance, feeling the arrowhead merge with sternum), though the final beats lean toward abstraction rather than dramatized struggle. His choice to become stillness rather than continue wandering shows genuine character evolution with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Cael's transformation into "the echo itself," with clear cost in surrendering individual identity to become the ancestral song. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently as layers of bone, dust, and memory build toward the final image. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly (Cael at canyon lip), and the piece maintains causal coherence despite its lyric mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bone towers function as both setting and instrument, constraining Cael's choice through their specific harmonic frequencies that make his "teeth ache." The canyon's acoustic properties directly enable the story's resolution, making the environment indispensable to the closure. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("surfaces etched by centuries of layered dust that whispered"), filtered through Cael's particular attention to sound and vibration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the "pulse left wandering"—is signaled early and maintains coherence throughout. Escalation occurs through deepening resonance rather than external reversals, appropriate to the accumulative lens. The cost appears in Cael's transformation ("feet rooted in stone while his spirit learned"), though the agency feels more surrendered than actively chosen in the final beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete interplay of movement and stillness, with the birds' spiral formation providing a non-literal answer to navigation. The arrowhead's transformation from inherited object to internalized compass avoids simple symbolism. The final image of becoming "the song his people had been trying to sing" resonates without stating a moral, though some passages edge toward abstraction ("the center of all things").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinct mythic register with controlled rhythm that intensifies through repetition and accumulation. POV remains stable with Cael as consistent focalizer, and his perceptual signature (reading patterns in flight, hearing frequencies others cannot) stays character-specific. Some passages risk elevated abstraction ("endless time," "perfect stillness") that slightly exceeds the established voice's grounding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions, and the piece avoids paraphrase loops. However, template cadence appears in repeated constructions ("The harmonic stone skimmer," "The bone towers began to sing"), and abstract phrases accumulate in the final third ("endless time," "the center of all things," "perfect stillness"). The prose maintains momentum but occasionally sacrifices concrete specificity for mythic resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of indigenous knowledge systems with harmonic physics creates a fresh angle on the vision quest narrative. The specific concept of "navigate without moving" and learning direction from "where you'd already been" transforms familiar spiritual journey tropes. The piece commits fully to its premise of sound-as-pathway, though it operates within recognizable mythic patterns.</comment>
