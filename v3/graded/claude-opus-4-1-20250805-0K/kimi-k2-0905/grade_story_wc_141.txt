<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arlen's internal contradiction between debunking myths and hoping for surprise drives authentic tension throughout. His mother's voice and the retelling mechanism create embodied emotional progression with visible cost. The final choice to leave the cello unvarnished shows values hierarchy through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Arlen transforms from myth-debunker to someone who accepts unmeasurable truth, with the cost of abandoning his professional identity visible in "myth buster, walked back down the cliff path carrying no proof." The accumulative lens holds as each retold voice builds toward understanding why "listeners insisted on difference."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choices (broken telescope swings, platform holds the cello) and the seashell's fit to the f-hole suggests designed purpose. Sensory detail like "boots crunching on glass that once measured starlight" filters through Arlen's perspective of debunked measurement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solving why civilizations bury three identical sounds—tightens through each retold voice until Arlen understands "the riddle was not why the sounds were identical, but why listeners insisted on difference." Cost appears in accepting unmeasurable truth over his myth-buster identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ending reweights the entire premise: measurement itself becomes "the final mystery" and truth should "remain porous." The three universal sounds (lullaby/warning/farewell) emerge through concrete action rather than assertion, avoiding any stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature in phrases like "violet minutes before twilight sealed the horizon" and "gloomy cheerfulness clung to him like salt spray." Voice modulates under pressure, shortening during the cello sequence. Some elevated diction ("ephemeral compass") slightly exceeds Arlen's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs: "glass that once measured starlight" establishes setting, history, and thematic concern. Some repetitive stems appear ("He retold," "Arlen felt") but serve the accumulative pattern. Minor register drift in peak beats ("ephemeral compass that points not to magnetic north").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of retelling voices through a cello to understand universal sounds offers fresh angle on myth-investigation. Specific synthesis of painted seashell, half-finished cello, and abandoned observatory creates non-obvious combination. The "gloomy cheerfulness" paradox enhances thematic complexity.</comment>
