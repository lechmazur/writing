<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet's motivation centers on incompleteness as beauty, embodied through micro-choices (tucking feather, drawing spiral, tearing sleeve). Internal contradiction manifests when he both tends and releases the horizon's wound. The woman character applies minimal pressure; her arrival feels convenient rather than causally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis—the poet accepts incompleteness as "the only doorway beauty knows." Cost appears in the torn sleeve, released spiral, and solitary return. The accumulative lens holds but the woman's arrival lacks causal grounding, appearing without setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lagoon, sand, and detritus constrain choices—the poet draws in wet sand, uses found objects, walks the tideline. Sensory detail filters through his aesthetic lens ("cobalt," "burnished hush"). The environment charges the final image of erasure becoming part of "woven dawns."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding beauty in brokenness deepens through the spiral gathering fragments and the zither collaboration. Cost manifests in the torn sleeve and letting the tide erase both spiral and words. The woman's arrival doesn't escalate existing pressure; it adds parallel action without raising stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accumulated particulars—torn feather catching light at edges, broken zither string that sighs instead of stings. The ending reweights prior fragments as "a net of almosts to keep him gently, imperfectly, alive." No explicit moralizing; the incomplete-as-doorway insight arises from dramatized experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature appears in phrases like "burnished hush" and "minor note chord." Some register drift occurs ("harmonizing discord into a loom of almost") that exceeds the poet's established lexicon. Voice modulates appropriately with the woman's arrival but returns to original texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density varies; strong passages like "Morning is a torn net that still holds fish" contrast with overwritten moments ("harmonizing discord into a loom of almost"). Template cadence appears in "Note by note, line by line" construction. Several metaphors strain coherence (spiral as mirrors, hush as something to warm hands over).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of collaborative art-making from found brokenness offers fresh inflection on healing narratives. Specific details (drake feather in mother's pin tin, zither strung with fishing line) avoid generic templates. Risk-taking appears in the lyric accumulation structure, though execution occasionally lapses into abstraction.</comment>
