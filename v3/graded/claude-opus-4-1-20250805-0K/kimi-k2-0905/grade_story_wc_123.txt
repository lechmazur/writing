<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—she chooses lateral movement and underground recording over compliance, with visible cost in abandoning her official position. The "credibly curious" trait drives key decisions from examining the pigeon to calibrating instruments underground. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("integrity depends on solitude") not fully embodied in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where Elara's final emergence with "quiet certainty" represents Earned Stasis—she renounces official recording with clear cost (career, safety). The impossible tomorrow-dated message creates effective pressure that tightens through discovery of truth-quarantine zones. Slight deduction for the cost being more implied than viscerally felt in the final moments.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underground phosphorescent map and pneumatic layers create tangible constraints that shape Elara's lateral movement choice. Sensory detail ("wet limestone and pigeon feathers") grounds the descent effectively. The courtyard-to-underground transition provides clear spatial choreography that enables the story's central evasion tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to systemic truth-suppression, with Elara's choice to record backward-dated entries creating immediate risk. The lateral movement represents meaningful agency that forecloses her return to official work. Cost is evident but could be more viscerally rendered in the final beat rather than stated as "quiet certainty."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The weather-as-truth metaphor earns its resonance through concrete details—uncensored storm data versus "gentle forecasts," rain "unrecorded by any official gauge." The final image of truth finding "its own velocity" like weather reweights all prior recording work. Theme emerges from action rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with scientific precision ("wind shear to the third decimal") and lyrical touches ("sky bruised into violet"). Some register elevation in philosophical moments ("truth, once released, finds its own velocity") slightly strains the established meteorologist POV. Perceptual signature strong in weather observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though occasional abstract phrasing ("borrowed hush," "populated by every honest storm") reduces immediacy. Some filter constructions ("she realized," "she intuited") dull key moments. The "credibly curious nature" phrase feels awkwardly inserted rather than organic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather recording with data integrity creates non-obvious stakes. The backward-dating strategy and pigeon-as-courier network show genuine ingenuity. The quarantine-as-truth-suppression reversal transforms expected disease containment into information control effectively.</comment>
