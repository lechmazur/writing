I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages as Lira diagnoses and repairs the drone against a ticking clock.

<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira's blindness creates genuine constraint that shapes her unique repair method through water refraction. Her motivation to "decode feedback into direction" manifests concretely when she teaches the drone to "translate its terror into torque," showing internal complexity under pressure. The apprentice Col provides functional pressure without overwhelming the single-scene focus.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from diagnosis through repair to launch, with the ship's departure creating genuine urgency. The closure lands with the drone racing to meet the Aurora, showing visible success after the established stakes. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of the seven-minute window aligning perfectly with repair completion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The depot setting with its "mist-coated rails" and "hissing dawn steam" creates atmosphere while the water drippers function as both worldbuilding and plot mechanism. The rain barrel becomes instrumental in the repair solution. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, though some occupational detail about the depot's broader operations could deepen the world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from technical (broken wing) to systemic (internal damage) to psychological (drone's learned fear), with the ship's departure providing hard deadline pressure. The village's medical needs create genuine external stakes. Cost appears when Lira must innovate beyond standard repair to address the drone's trauma.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of translating "feedback into direction" emerges organically through Lira's repair method and her own post-accident adaptation. The parallel between Lira's trauma and the drone's creates resonance without explicit statement. The final image of the drone as "a tiny artificial star" subtly elevates the mechanical to something more meaningful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with technical precision ("lumen-veins," "molten silica") balanced against poetic perception ("singing spectra"). Lira's blindness shapes unique sensory priorities throughout. Col's brief dialogue maintains naturalism while providing essential visual information Lira cannot access.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive prose with varied sentence structures and strong verb choices ("hissed," "bleeding," "shot"). Information density remains high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition in "magnetic calm" phrase but used purposefully to link Lira's state with the drone's recovery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The blind artisan using light refraction for repairs offers fresh specificity. The solution of teaching the traumatized drone through water ripples shows ingenuity. The integration of multiple elements feels organic rather than forced, though the concept doesn't fully transform its genre.</comment>
