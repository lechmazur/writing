<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Riven's motivation through maternal absence drives every choice, with embodied grief ("pressed against his ribs") and the thunderstorm-for-letters trade showing contradictory impulses in action. The final delivery of undelivered letters demonstrates earned change through specific cost. Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("fostered absences") and occasional emotional summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where the thunderstorm's transformation into rain enables mass letter delivery, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (trading weather for words). The piece teaches its magical realist pattern early and pays it off through concrete action. Orientation anchors establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The arcade setting constrains choices through its surveillance ("smuggling drone border"), hidden pathways ("service tunnel"), and specific game cabinet that enables contact. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("cobalt," "indigo," "ozone and old tickets"). The thunderstorm-in-bottle functions as micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: surveillance threat → mother's voice → key discovery → letter retrieval → weather-for-words trade with visible cost. The dominant stake (reuniting separated families through forbidden mail) tightens when Riven must sacrifice his only power source. Agency drives each turn under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the thunderstorm-letter exchange literalizes how communication requires sacrifice. The ending image of "promises being kept" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the "disputed territory" as emotional rather than physical. Minor deduction for slight thematic echo in "where broken promises heal."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled diction ("respectfully rebellious," "brittle hush") and consistent POV. Some figurative density borders on overwriting but serves the accumulative design. Occasional register elevation ("fostered absences") slightly exceeds the mailman-POV's natural lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm variation and high information density. Deductions for occasional overwriting (mixed metaphors like "neon veins flickering like dying stars"), some template repetition ("Riven [verb]" patterns), and minor register drift in peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The magical realist premise of weather-as-currency and arcade-as-portal offers fresh synthesis. The specific world-building (surveillance drones policing emotional contraband) transforms familiar dystopian elements. The thunderstorm-letter exchange mechanism feels earned and non-obvious.</comment>
