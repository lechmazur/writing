<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Luma's internal journey from searching for lost color to realizing joy was never lost but needed to be "developed" shows genuine character progression with embodied emotion (the fresco warming against her ribs, each brushstroke costing "a sigh of present sorrow"). The closure choice to leave "pocket empty yet heart over-exposed" demonstrates earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through layered imagery (fog folding, light painting, memory projection) to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Luma realizes joy must be "developed, exposed by risk and displayed by courage." The closure lands with felt cost ("each brushstroke cost her a sigh of present sorrow") and the final image of the laughing girl continuing to refill the orchard "one sun-drop at a time" reweights the opening search.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district's fog becomes a functional constraint that both hides and preserves memory, while specific details like "a cider house whose plaster still smelled faintly of fermented stars" create vivid atmosphere. The environment directly shapes Luma's choices—the fresco fragment can only be found in the cracked press, the memory can only be developed on "a living wall"—making setting essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering lost joy—deepens from abstract search to concrete recovery when Luma must pay "a sigh of present sorrow" for each brushstroke, creating genuine trade-off. While escalation under the textural lens works through accumulation rather than reversal, the cost feels somewhat abstract until the final painting sequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of joy requiring active development rather than passive recovery emerges organically through concrete action (finding fragment, consulting network, painting with extracted light). The final realization that joy "had merely waited to be developed, exposed by risk and displayed by courage" offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire search without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistent texture with inventive phrases like "fog that drowned," "soft pleats of mist," and "fermented stars," though occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("conspiratorial wink," "pensive mirth"). POV control remains stable with Luma's artistic perception coloring all observations, particularly in how she sees light and color as tangible materials.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong imagery and rhythm variation but suffers from occasional overwrought metaphors ("heart over-exposed," "cognitive smoothness") and some template cadence in the middle section. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, though phrases like "proof that the wall still projects its secret reel" feel unnecessarily complex for their payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of painting with light itself and developing memories like film offers fresh synthesis of artistic and photographic metaphors. The Lantern Lattice network of dead painters' knowledge and the idea of joy as something that must be "developed" rather than found transforms familiar lost-and-found tropes through specific artistic lens.</comment>
