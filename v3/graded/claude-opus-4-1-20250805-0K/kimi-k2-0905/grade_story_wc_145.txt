<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's dry wit and subtle confidence manifest through concrete actions—ignoring the Registry's hail to study condensation patterns, tearing the illuminated page—with her final choice to listen for rivers over radios showing genuine transformation. The internal consistency holds, though some transitions between scientific observation and mystical acceptance could use sharper motivation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Maren's shift from cataloging dead ends to becoming a keeper of hidden knowledge, with visible cost in her isolation and the falcon's death. The accumulative/textural lens coheres as language-as-key builds to the underground revelation, though the magical realism turn at "mayu" could be better prepared.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen lake and underground estuary function as more than backdrop—the ice crack's delta shape, the warm updraft puppeteering the dead falcon, and the microorganism light-language all constrain choices and enable the final revelation. The rusted outpost and its abandoned furnace frame Maren's departure with tangible consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional curiosity through the falcon's return to the "convergence" summons, culminating in Maren's descent and choice to disseminate forbidden knowledge. The cost manifests in the falcon's death and Maren's knowing isolation, though the Registry's threat level remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The central question "where do the rivers begin?" transforms from geographic to metaphysical through concrete discovery—the underground confluence where language and water merge. The final image of Maren listening for "rivers learning to speak" resonantly reweights the entire cataloging enterprise without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren's perceptual signature—noting breath-spiral patterns, the falcon's filmed eyes, microorganism light-spelling—creates a distinct scientific-mystical hybrid voice. The prose modulates effectively from clinical observation to wonder, though occasional overwriting ("ephemeral map visible only from the surface") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the descent sequence where each detail advances both plot and atmosphere. Some figurative excess appears ("throat cartilage" walls, "silver thread that stitched the world") and the phrase "worrying tranquility" repeats verbatim, creating minor drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartographic precision with mystical discovery through language-as-key offers genuine freshness, particularly the microorganisms spelling river words in light. The underground river confluence as origin point transforms the mapping trope through specific lived detail.</comment>
