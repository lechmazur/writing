I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered sonic memories and echoes, with the tunnel's acoustic properties accumulating meaning until the final resonant transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ellery's grief-driven motivation is embodied through concrete actions with the leaf blower, and his internal contradiction between hope and acceptance plays out physically in the tunnel. The transformation from seeking to restore Quinn's laughter to understanding "tending to the unspoken does not mean bringing the dead back" shows earned wisdom through struggle, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands with felt cost as Ellery accepts absence while giving it "a shape echoing can carry," and the house's final exhalation confirms transformation. The accumulative structure coheres as sound layers build meaning, though the magical realist element of Quinn's actual laughter emerging could use one more grounding beat to fully earn its impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tunnel functions as both setting and instrument, constraining and enabling Ellery's ritual while its acoustic properties drive the story's central transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("concrete throat," "glass marble dropped onto tile"), with the tunnel's echo-chamber quality essential to both action and meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring laughter/joy to the grieving household—deepens through Ellery's tunnel performance as he moves from trying to resurrect the dead to accepting absence while preserving echo. The cost is visible in his physical collapse to his knees and the "macerated" heart, though the actual emergence of Quinn's laughter slightly softens what could be a harder-earned acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of grief's transformation emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of sound and echo, with the final insight about "giving absence a shape echoing can carry" offering a resonant answer without moralizing. The hourglass-to-tunnel-to-home progression creates layers of meaning about time, memory, and persistence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinctive lyrical register with controlled metaphorical density ("memorial symphony conductor," "concrete throat," "pendulum that had finished counting heartbeats"). POV remains stable with Ellery's grief coloring perception consistently, though occasional phrases like "mournfully eager" feel slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully to match emotional beats, with longer accumulative sentences during memory and shorter cuts during action. Some metaphorical density in peak moments ("heart macerated itself against his ribs") borders on overwriting but stays legible; "memorial" should likely be "leaf-blower" in the opening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The leaf-blower-as-instrument concept offers a fresh angle on grief ritual, transforming a mundane tool into something ceremonial and meaningful. The specific detail of conducting backyard birthday symphonies and the tunnel's acoustic transformation of mechanical noise into lullaby show genuine ingenuity.</comment>
