<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between trained detachment and suppressed empathy drives meaningful choices, particularly when she swallows her bottled emotions and confronts the Keeper. The transformation from restrained to "armed with unfiltered compassion" is earned through concrete action. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("terrifying and bright") rather than fully embodied sensation in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Decisive Change closure where Mara transforms the border from "barricade" to "bridge," with clear cost (trapped reflection as collateral, centuries of suppressed feeling). The causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkage from fragment discovery through harbor entry to Keeper confrontation. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words. Minor deduction for slight convenience in how easily she locates her specific emotion crate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard setting actively constrains choices (ice floes threatening at dawn creates urgency, mirrors as portals enable action). Vivid sensory detail like "boots silent on planks soaked with other people's grief" grounds the fantastical. The setting transformation at closure (orchard tasting of apples instead of salt) charges the final image. Some generic descriptors ("foggy pier," "dark water") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate meaningfully from preserving a border to confronting systemic emotional suppression, with Mara's agency driving each turn. The cost is legible when she sacrifices her reflection and absorbs overwhelming empathy. The tightening occurs when she must act before dawn as ice threatens the lighthouse. Minor deduction as the Keeper's defeat feels slightly mechanical despite thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of emotions as tradeable commodities and the cost of professional detachment. The final image of the sphere dripping empathy into future keepers' dreams offers a non-literal answer to whether feeling can coexist with duty. Strong subtext in the mirror mechanics and the harbor market. Avoids moralizing while maintaining complexity about necessary boundaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance that tightens during the harbor sequence. Distinctive perceptual signature in how Mara processes emotional residue on objects. Clean free indirect style without head-hopping. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("weighted breath," "reconstituted itself") that slightly exceeds the established voice texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Strong moments like "emotions flew home like startled gulls" balance concrete and figurative. Some template phrasing ("She breathed once, twice") and repetitive "Mara [verb]" constructions in middle sections. Minor overwriting in places ("holes cut into parchment skin") but no loops or scaffolding that damage closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of peacekeepers who suppress empathy to maintain metaphysical borders offers a fresh angle on emotional labor. The specific world-building around memory markets and emotion preservation feels original. However, the resolution follows predictable beats once the premise is established, and some elements (crystal ball, lighthouse keeper) draw on familiar fantasy tropes without sufficient transformation.</comment>
