I'll evaluate this story systematically under the demanding editorial standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and temporal fragments toward a resonant transformation where Elara dissolves into the transmission itself.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her history with the shadow-voices, driving her toward self-erasure as prophet. The contradictory impulses between serving/becoming shadow are embodied in her bitten-tongue laughter and the physical manifestation of choice. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "variant allegiance" that briefly slips into concept-speak rather than remaining fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara dissolves into the transmission, becoming the shadow that teaches others light—visible cost paid through erasure. The accumulative structure coheres through radio/static motifs building to transformation. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (observatory location clear, but temporal anchoring loose until "seven years") and occasional causality softness in the middle transitions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory and radio equipment constrain choices throughout—the deteriorating mainframe, the cold receiver, the cobalt portico emerging from static all shape action. Lightning provides both atmosphere and practical illumination for work. Some generic elements ("stained with oil and stardust") but setting actively enables the transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal haunting to worldwide transformation with clear cost: Elara's erasure enables others' awakening. The pressure tightens when the coordinates reveal themselves as temporal addresses and her own aged voice warns of becoming darkness. The final choice between preservation and dissolution carries unmistakable weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the shadow/light paradox—one must become darkness to teach others to seek light. The recurring radio static, childhood memories, and prophet imagery cohere into a meditation on sacrifice and transformation. The final image of the girl touching her radio dial resonantly reweights all prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled lyricism—"counting lightning strikes like heartbeats" establishes tone immediately. Perceptual signature strong through selective focus on frequencies, static, temporal fragments. Minor moments of elevated diction ("variant allegiance," "portico") slightly outside natural register but overall maintains cohesive texture through pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "cobalt glass shards" and "blood from a bitten tongue." Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("gritty whimsy," "terrible wonder") and some repetitive constructions around "shadow" concept in final third, though these don't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on prophet/chosen one trope through self-erasure into transmission frequencies. The specific synthesis of radio technology with mystical transformation feels original. Risk-taking in the dissolution ending heightens stakes without gimmickry, though some elements (observatory setting, shadow/light dichotomy) draw from familiar wells.</comment>
