<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation to "pull the teeth" from comfortable lies drives coherent action through diamond retrieval and broadcast, with internal consistency between her past as debunker and present as truth-excavator. The final choice to broadcast archived lies through the diamond shows earned agency with visible cost (accelerating rot). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "inventory every deception" rather than fully embodied response.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through hexagonal scars, letter reassembly, and diamond resonance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where broadcasting lies accelerates rot. Cost is visible in both Marisol's physical response ("tasted copper and shame") and the orchard's transformation. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract conceptual leap around how the diamond's broadcast affects the trees.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The radioactive orchard with its impossibly glossy apples creates immediate atmospheric tension, while hexagonal scars and the stillpoint constrain Marisol's search pattern. The setting actively shapes tactics through the Geiger counter's readings, temperature drops, and the final image of browning apples where "truth accelerating rot faster than radiation could preserve the lie" charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of excavating truth escalates through physical search, letter reassembly revealing the diamond's curse, and the visceral playback forcing Marisol to confront her complicity. The final broadcasting choice shows clear agency with visible cost in the orchard's decay. Minor deduction as the middle development could show more resistance or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of preserved lies versus accelerating truth, with the diamond forcing "perfect memory" as curse. The final image of browning apples offers a non-literal answer about truth's corrosive necessity. Strong integration though some passages like "excavate truth from comfortable lies" edge toward explicit theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice with evocative phrases like "clicked like an angry cicada" and consistent POV control through Marisol's perception. Some elevated diction ("palimpsest," "tessellation") fits her background as intellectual/debunker. Deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't fully integrate with character voice, particularly in more abstract passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and good momentum, but several instances of elevated diction and abstract phrasing ("inventory every deception," "deliberate palimpsest") that slow key beats. Some near-repetition around the lies/truth binary. The clarity remains strong enough for closure to land effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with truth-as-virus concept, particularly the hexagonal scarring and the diamond that plays back lies. The specific detail of reassembling shredded letters and the orchard as "slow-motion printing press" shows originality. Some familiar post-apocalyptic elements prevent higher scoring.</comment>
