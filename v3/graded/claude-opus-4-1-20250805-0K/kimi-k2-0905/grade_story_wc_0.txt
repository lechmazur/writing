I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric with precision.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered scientific observation and metaphor, with pattern recognition driving toward a conceptual reweighting rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal journey from frantic grief to acceptance is earned through concrete scientific methodology, with contradictory impulses (seeking silence while processing catastrophe) acting in scene. The final renunciation of urgency carries visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction in emotional states ("kindled humility" appears twice as a label).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where the butterfly dust analysis reweights Mara's understanding of change and grief, with clear emotional cost ("for the first time since the waters rose"). The accumulative lens holds consistently through scientific observation building to personal revelation. Orientation anchors arrive clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as both literal setting and constraint, with storm damage creating the specific conditions (butterfly dust, broken glass, humidity) that enable discovery. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("air tasted of rotting orchids and galvanized steel"). The deteriorating environment directly shapes Mara's methodology and final insight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure builds through accumulation of scientific data converging with personal grief, culminating in the 0.003% match that validates her hypothesis. The deepening from cosmic to personal scale ("her own frantic pulses of grief") creates meaningful stakes. Cost is legible in her acceptance of ongoing change rather than escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the butterfly/neutron star parallel without explicit moralizing. The final insight that "drama is optional; change is not" resonates as earned wisdom from concrete observation. The recurring scale/dust motif accumulates meaning, charging the closure with both scientific and emotional truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive scientific voice with controlled technical register that modulates appropriately with emotional beats. Perceptual signature strong in how Mara processes reality through scientific frameworks. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("courtesy extended to everything") that slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied syntax. However, several instances of elevated diction strain the voice ("kindled humility" appears twice, "courtesy extended"). Some filter-verb clustering in middle sections. The scientific terminology is precise and purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of astrophysics and lepidoptery to explore grief creates genuine originality. The specific parallel between butterfly scales and neutron star decay feels both surprising and inevitable. The commitment to scientific methodology as emotional processing is distinctive and fully realized.</comment>
