<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's claustrophobia creates genuine internal contradiction against her mission's demands, with embodied stress responses ("counting breaths," "trembling glove") that intensify as the tunnel narrows. The technicians' characterization through their frozen states and names adds depth. Deducted for some abstract emotional labeling ("claustrophobia screamed") and the somewhat convenient resolution where all technicians simply step free without lasting consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught phase transitions building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where naming returns the lost. The gold fleck's transformation from solid to liquid to lacquer creates clear causality. Cost is visible in the technicians' suffering and Mara's physical ordeal. Minor deduction for the slightly too-neat resolution where the facility "reknits itself" without clearer mechanical explanation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The environment actively constrains choices through the narrowing tunnel, phase-shifting walls, and tidal pressures. Excellent sensory hierarchy with gold fleck illumination and "throat of stone that pulsed." The facility's transformation from steel to basalt to restored corridor directly shapes Mara's journey. Setting becomes agent of change rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering the unremembered) escalates through physical constriction, the horror of finding fused technicians, and the risk of phase-transition entrapment. The tightening occurs as Mara descends deeper and stakes compound. Slight deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution mechanics where touching Voss "initiates the return" without established cost to Mara herself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the act of witnessing and naming—memory as resurrection. The gold fleck functions as more than ornament, becoming the medium of return. Final image of Mara carrying names "like copper strand in the long cable between past and tomorrow" perfectly reweights the opening without stating a moral. The obligation of remembering gains texture through specific bodily cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature with technical/geological specificity ("bulkhead," "basalt," "conduit"). Clean third-person limited with no head-hopping. Excellent modulation during stress sequences where syntax tightens. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds Mara's established voice ("auroral scars," "abyssal silence").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong propulsion with varied sentence structures and purposeful compression during the descent sequence. Information density high throughout with lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in places ("phase transition," "fractal burns") that occasionally tips toward overwriting but remains coherent. The "crashing hush" oxymoron works effectively as a recurring motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spelunking, undersea cables, and phase-transition physics creates an original supernatural recovery narrative. The specific combination of technicians fused to equipment and restoration through naming feels earned and non-obvious. Risk-taking in the surreal physics pays off. Bonus for the haunting image of Sato "broadcasting at the speed of regret."</comment>
