<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pilgrim's internal journey from seeking "where unused love is stored" to actively "distributing" it demonstrates clear character arc with embodied emotion (chest fracture healing). However, the man remains functionally passive beyond breathing exercises, and some therapeutic language ("unused love," "withheld tenderness") edges toward diagnostic self-awareness mid-crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the pilgrim transforms from seeker to distributor, with visible cost in the "fracture in her chest" healing. The accumulative/textural lens holds through breathing patterns and petal imagery, but the orchard sequence introduces late rule-changes (fruit as withheld kindness) that strain causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct setting actively constrains and enables action through the camera obscura's projection and wisteria-woven door. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("scent was so heavy it felt drinkable"), though the sudden orchard transition lacks spatial grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake of healing "unused love" escalates through breathing synchronization to the orchard revelation, with cost visible in the chest fracture. However, the man's appearance feels coincidental rather than earned, and the resolution relies on mystical transformation rather than character agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete imagery (jade tear, projected flowers, distributed droplets) rather than statement, with the final shift from seeking to distributing offering resonant closure. The concept that "storage is not a place but a posture" arises from dramatized discovery, though some passages veer toward explicit philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistent texture through synesthetic perception ("tasted purple") and purposeful compression. However, dialogue lacks naturalism ("I lost the address of the love I never gave") and both characters converge toward similar registers during emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from conceptual loops ("unused love" appears 5 times) and elevated diction that occasionally obscures clarity ("foggy lucidity made fruit flesh"). Template structures appear in the resolution sequence ("She felt... She asked... She understood...") dulling momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The camera obscura as portal device and breathing as transformation method offer fresh angles on healing trauma. The synthesis of pilgrimage, optical projection, and respiratory meditation creates an original framework, though some elements (mystical fruit orchard) lean toward familiar spiritual journey templates.</comment>
