I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category systematically.

**Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered sensory imagery and symbolic accumulation toward Elian's transformation, with density increases and pattern breaks marking progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's synesthetic perception creates distinctive interiority, and his transformation from seeking external certification to embodying wonder shows earned change. The swallowing of the sheet as internalization works symbolically, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("wonder was not luxury but infrastructure").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - Elian transforms from seeker to living document of wonder with visible cost (stripping away protective scales). However, the accumulative progression through the cavern chambers could tighten; some symbolic passages feel decorative rather than pressure-building.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ice cavern functions as more than setting - it actively tests and transforms Elian through the Echoless Vein and aurora colors. Synesthetic details ("footfall painted violet ripples," "ice sang back in crimson") create vivid sensory specificity that constrains his navigation and shapes the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (certifying wonder before it's outlawed) drives Elian deeper through escalating tests - the aurora stripping defenses, the acoustic amber requiring proof of values. The cost appears in surrendering protective scales and becoming wonder's "living document," though middle pressure could intensify.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete imagery rather than stated morals - the amber sheet dissolving into "warm cider harmony" embodies wonder's internalization. The final image of Elian as testimony reweights the opening's external validation quest, though Olesia's quoted wisdom ("wonder was not luxury but infrastructure") edges toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synesthetic POV creates a distinct perceptual signature where sound has color and touch produces music. Voice maintains consistency through lyrical compression ("sculpted hush," "fossilized sunrise") that serves the accumulative mode, with controlled modulation during transformation sequences.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with images doing multiple jobs ("prism-song refracted through the sphere, splitting silence into a spectrum of audible light"). Some passages risk overwriting ("oscillating repose," "acoustic amber") but generally maintain momentum through varied syntax and purposeful compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synesthetic bell-ringer navigating by colored sound offers genuine freshness, transforming the quest narrative through specific sensory logic. The concept of swallowing music to become living testimony shows risk-taking that heightens stakes while maintaining coherence.</comment>
