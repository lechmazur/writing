I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through lyric density and image patterns toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the cartomancer transforms grief into a new form of presence.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer's grief manifests through concrete, embodied details like "her boots leaving no print on the silver moss" and the saucer crack that "glows faintly with the memory of every sip of imaginary tea." Her transformation from carrying trapped time to releasing it shows genuine emotional progression with visible cost—particularly in the moment where "Time rushed back into her body in a single inhale" and she "laughed and wept simultaneously."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the cartomancer transforms from seeking lost time to accepting its accumulation "wherever love refuses to end." The closure lands with felt cost as she learns to "unfasten grief without forgetting love" and creates a permanent trace for other grieving parents. The accumulative structure coheres through recurring images (saucer crack, traced hands, clouds) that reweight at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The midnight glade above/inside clouds functions as both setting and metaphysical space where "minutes fell upward instead of down." Physical details like "silver moss that grew only where starlight could not reach" create specificity while the cloud as "cathedral of vapor and regret" constrains and enables the cartomancer's ritual transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation as the cartomancer confronts increasingly specific losses—from the general "daughter had never tasted" to the precise minutes of "3:42 a.m. when labor began, 4:17 when the heartbeat stopped." The saucer crack widening into "a canyon through which tiny porcelain voices rose" creates escalation through textural intensification rather than plot reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the central image of "every fracture is only a doorway shaped like a question mark" and the insight that "lost time accumulates wherever love refuses to end." The story resists resolution, instead offering the complex truth that grief can be unfastened without forgetting love, embodied in the final image of children who "exist forever in the choking beauty of almost."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent lyric elevation with distinctive constructions like "onyx-ink cartomancer" and "willingly perplexed." Some moments strain toward over-decoration ("lightning bolt of memory that struck her chest, unfasten the clasp of grief"), but the voice generally sustains its dreamlike register while maintaining comprehension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose density creates both strength and weakness—vivid images like "the moonlight tasted of sugared milk gone cold" showcase control, but repetitive use of "unfasten" (appears 4 times) and occasional awkward constructions ("had come willingly perplexed to the one altitude") create friction. The text maintains momentum through accumulation despite these artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story transforms the prompt elements into an original meditation on grief's persistence and transformation. The conceit of time pooling "behind the mirror, inside the chimney, beneath the fingernails of the dying" offers fresh perspective, while the family custom of tracing hands becomes a constellation guiding other grieving parents—an earned, non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
