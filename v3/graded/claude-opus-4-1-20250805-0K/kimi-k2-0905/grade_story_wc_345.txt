<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's altruistic motivation drives concrete micro-choices (knocking fruit only when hands are ready, becoming counterweight) with clear internal consistency. The ghost's inability to hold objects but ability to chill/balance creates genuine constraint that shapes her choices. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around trust and community bonding that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara dissolves into the nebula itself, transforming from individual ghost to collective resource. Cost is legible in her release of individual form. Orientation anchors (ghost, twin suns, Orchard Planet) establish by ~40 words. The pattern of chalked messages → collective action → harvest success builds coherently to the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Floating rock arches with dying anti-grav seeds create immediate physical constraint that drives the harvest urgency. The butterfly garden, bronze bell, and chalk-dusted paths provide tactile anchoring. Setting actively shapes choices (arches tilting threatens food supply, chalk on slate enables ghost communication). Minor deduction for some abstract descriptors ("violet cloud that slowed time").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the orchards before eclipse) established early with clear tightening as colonists move from individual ladder attempts to coordinated human chains. The physical constraint of tilting arches escalates pressure. Cost visible in the risk of falling and final dissolution of Mara's individual form, though middle escalation could intensify further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of strangers into family via shared labor, with the final line "survival is a collective verb" arising from dramatized events rather than assertion. The butterfly wing dust message and bronze bell create resonant motifs that accumulate meaning. Mara's transformation into the nebula itself offers a non-literal answer about individual sacrifice enabling collective thriving.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited following Mara with clean psychic distance and no head-hopping. Voice maintains lyrical register appropriate to ghost perspective ("condensation swirling where her ankles should have been"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("brambled hope," "slow ripening") but largely serves the otherworldly POV. Dialogue absent but not required.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density decent with most lines advancing multiple elements. Deductions for abstract phrases that could be more concrete ("reservoir of respite," "anesthesia that bound them"), some filter-verb clusters ("felt the ghost's altruistic pulse"), and occasional overwriting in metaphors ("brambled hope, a clang like berries caught in wire").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story with communal survival that transforms the haunting trope into collaborative salvation. The specific detail of frost-writing messages and ghost-as-counterweight shows originality. The transformation of individual spirit into collective resource offers non-obvious resolution. Minor deduction for some familiar beats in the community-building arc.</comment>
