I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through sensory layering, recurring motifs, and pattern intensification rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation centers on proving that gentle frequencies can reach farther than mechanical force, grounded in her mother's teaching about vibrations of intent. Her actions—adjusting the beacon to pulse in a remembered heartbeat rhythm, whispering into the cork, creating visible waves of intention—all serve this coherent drive. The internal conflict between mechanical duty and spiritual belief creates authentic tension, though some passages drift into abstract philosophizing ("wherever vibrations of intent go when they leave the body") that slightly weakens embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: the boat's course change validates the protagonist's belief that whispers travel farther than warnings, crystallizing her method as viable. The piece anchors who/where/when adequately (assistant keeper, lighthouse, dawn after heat wave), and the accumulative structure coheres as sensory details build toward the closing proof. However, the mother's disappearance backstory feels somewhat disconnected from the present action, and the cost—while emotionally implied through "screaming tenderness"—could be more concretely dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, night garden, and dawn transition create a vivid sensory environment that actively shapes the protagonist's choices—she must wait for the heat to break before subtle frequencies can be heard, uses the garden's scent as a communication medium. Sensory detail is rich and purposeful: "night-blooming jasmine," "gardenia, tobacco flower, and the faint metallic taste of approaching rain." The setting constrains action (waiting for cool air) and enables the final test (boat appearing at dawn), making environment essential to the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers can guide better than mechanical warnings—is established early and tested when the boat changes course. Escalation occurs through accumulation: from touching the door, to climbing stairs, to adjusting the beacon, to the garden ritual, culminating in the boat's response. The tension between mechanical duty and spiritual belief creates genuine conflict. However, the lack of active opposition or complication keeps the stakes somewhat abstract until the final validation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme emerges elegantly through the contrast between "screaming" mechanical systems and gentle vibrations, with the paradox that "the softer we become, the farther we reach" earned through dramatized action. The recurring motifs of vibration, scent, and light cohere meaningfully, especially when the lighthouse beam learns "the rhythm of human softness." The mother's teaching about vibrations traveling through stone, salt, and silence gains resonance through the protagonist's ritual. Minor deduction for occasional abstract philosophizing that approaches theme statement rather than pure emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the protagonist's spiritual sensibility, with controlled rhythm that mirrors the story's meditative pace. Focalization remains stable in third-person limited, filtering all perception through the protagonist's consciousness. Distinctive phrases like "screaming tenderness" and "dawn bleeding across the horizon like a wound finally allowed to close" create memorable texture. Some passages become overly ornate ("wherever vibrations of intent go when they leave the body") without clear payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong moments of vivid, precise language: "cobalt tower's cool iron door," "prism that scattered her whispered intention across the courtyard in visible waves." Information density is generally high, with most sentences advancing atmosphere, character, or theme. However, several instances of overwriting appear: mixed metaphor in "dawn bleeding...like a wound," unnecessary abstraction in passages about vibrations traveling after death, and some repetitive phrasing around "purified intentions" that creates minor loops without deepening meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of using garden scent and subtle vibrations to guide ships offers a fresh angle on lighthouse keeper stories, avoiding typical storm-and-rescue scenarios. The synthesis of sensory communication, maternal loss, and the paradox of gentle strength creates an original emotional landscape. The specific combination of elements—cork as memory object, garden as communication medium, lighthouse beam learning human rhythm—feels organic rather than assembled. The ending's quiet validation through the boat's course change avoids predictable resolution.</comment>
