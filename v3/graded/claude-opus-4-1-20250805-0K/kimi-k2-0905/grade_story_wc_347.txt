<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization achieves strong embodied emotion through concrete details like "clenched a small nut" and "tasting iron and pine," with her motivation rooted in duty rather than love creating authentic internal conflict. The micro-choices of leaving warmth-ghosts and crushing the nut-kernel reveal her values under pressure with visible cost. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of travelers reaching critical junctions just as Mara arrives to help.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Earned Stasis closure—Mara's acceptance of her cursed role forecloses freedom with visible cost ("the long walk back to the orchard that kept her prisoner"). The piece teaches its pattern early through the warmth-ghost mechanism and mechanical birds' rules, building density through repeated gestures that culminate in the saved travelers. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3 with who/where/when clear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of setting as constraint—the cliff edge, labyrinth walls, and mechanical birds actively shape every tactical choice Mara makes. The frost deadline creates tangible pressure, and the environment constrains her to indirect methods. Vivid sensory detail ("brass wings clicking like metronomes," "frost-brittle grass") filtered through Mara's urgent perception charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving travelers before frost) established immediately with clear time pressure. Escalation reads through accumulating warmth-ghosts and the final handprint constellation, with meaningful deepening when Mara uses the nut's blueprint. Cost is legible in her permanent imprisonment and the "graceless beauty" of saving strangers she'll never meet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of imprisonment enabling salvation—Mara's curse becomes her purpose. The nut transforms from mother's gift to tactical tool, reweighting its meaning. The final image of "graceless beauty" offers a non-literal answer to duty versus freedom without moralizing, though the concept could resonate more deeply through the travelers' perspective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout—Mara notices in tactical terms ("third junction, where the path split into seven lies") with consistent POV control. Prose rhythm accelerates during the time-critical final sequence. Voice maintains consistency even under pressure, with purposeful compression ("Time thinned") that serves urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Wind hissed through the cliffside labyrinth patrolled by mechanical birds, their brass wings clicking like metronomes against the dusk" establishes setting, threat, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops or scaffolding, strong verb choices throughout. Minor deduction for occasional filter construction ("she saw the travelers") in high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of curse-as-duty with the specific innovation of warmth-ghosts as communication method. The mechanical birds and microscopic blueprint on the nut shell show imaginative worldbuilding. Risk-taking in the indirect salvation method heightens stakes—Mara can only guide, never directly intervene.</comment>
