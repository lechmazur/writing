I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds density through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara accepts the weight of her brother's truth.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between "religiously skeptical" and her compulsive engagement with psychics drives authentic tension. The final transformation from lead to brass shows earned change through concrete experience. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional beats ("dense as a lead slug") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where accepting the wheel's weight transforms Mara's burden from lead to brass—a felt cost is visible. The accumulative structure coheres well with repeated motifs (weight, swallowing, measuring) building to the revelation about her brother locking himself out rather than others in. Slight opacity in the ghost shift's exact nature prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tunnel setting effectively constrains choices through its darkness, dripping water, and service ladder. The beaded valve wheel functions brilliantly as micro-setting that shapes the entire resolution. Some industrial details remain vague ("Beltram Valve Works") but the sensory work is strong, particularly the "mineral stink" and metal-on-metal rhythm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative deepening: from hearing the confession → finding the wheel → discovering the names → speaking to the dead → understanding the truth. The cost lands clearly when Mara accepts bearing witness. The single meaningful turn (understanding her brother locked himself out) effectively reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "swallowed truth" and its physical manifestation in the weighted wheel. The transformation from lead to brass beautifully captures the shift from unbearable to bearable truth. The ending achieves resonance without stating its moral about guilt, witness, and forgiveness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and effective compression ("religiously skeptical to the marrow"). The perceptual signature is strong—Mara notices weight, sound, and industrial details in character-specific ways. Some register elevation in peak moments ("gyroscope measuring the new equilibrium") slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with good information density and varied syntax. However, several instances of elevated diction strain clarity: "beaded gyroscope measuring the new equilibrium," "secular, unproved, yet weighty enough to carry." The metaphorical density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies, particularly in the middle sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a ghost shift that keeps working until witnessed offers a fresh angle on industrial Gothic. The specific synthesis of factory accident, radio psychics, and family guilt creates something distinctive. The brass valve wheel as repository of truth is particularly inventive, though some elements feel slightly derivative of established ghost-worker tropes.</comment>
