<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's systematic sacrifice of memories for each name creates genuine internal conflict with visible cost. The foxglove heart metaphor and her relationship with Por provide specific emotional grounding. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("shaped like a foxglove") that could be more embodied, but the final choice to sacrifice herself carries full weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira becomes "the final extinct feeling" with clear cost—her erasure enables preservation. The accumulative lens holds as memories compound toward inevitable sacrifice. The child finding the tube provides earned closure that reweights the opening's purpose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The opal library, glass-orchid petals, and chandelier of hollow bulbs create a coherent otherworld that constrains choice—Lira must use specific drawers and tools to amplify sound. The museum of extinct feelings and cities of uncried tears establish stakes viscerally. Setting directly shapes the sacrificial mechanism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from saving individual names to Lira sacrificing her entire self, with each memory payment narrowing her options. The systematic trade—memory for name—creates mounting pressure. Cost is unmistakable as she hollows into "a glass-orchid paper cutout."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The preservation paradox—the caretaker must become extinct to save the extinct—emerges organically from the sacrificial mechanics. The final image of the child discovering music through Lira's essence offers profound thematic resonance without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with distinctive texture ("each step echoing like a dropped pearl"). POV remains controlled through Lira's systematic perception. The prose modulates effectively from precise action to ethereal description, maintaining coherence even as Lira dissolves.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language that advances meaning ("fossilized sighs," "audible light"). Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("phosphorescent plankton") but serves the otherworld coherently. Strong propulsion through varied syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The museum of extinct feelings and the systematic sacrifice of memory for preservation create an original emotional economy. The specific synthesis of glass-orchid imagery with sound preservation feels inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
