<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mila's progression from passive copyist to active resistance fighter is earned through concrete micro-choices (copying silence, mixing rosin ink, building antennae). Her internal conflict between preservation and action manifests in embodied details like "diligent fingers" and tactical decisions. The final image of her "notating tomorrow's clandestine overture on the parchment of the air itself" shows earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mila teaching dust to narrate, transforming both the physical space and the inspectors. The accumulative lens holds as density increases from individual copying to hall-wide transmission to city-wide dispersion. Cost is visible in the inspectors "silently mouthing newly learned words, their uniforms shedding ash like pages turning."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ember alcove and its sensory details (green phosphor glow, mist tasting of iron, rosin dust) constrain and enable Mila's choices throughout. The concert hall's abandoned instruments become resources for resistance. Setting evolution from alcove to hall to city tracks with escalating stakes, though some descriptions lean toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal preservation through clandestine transmission to city-wide awakening, with the winter solstice deadline creating urgency. The transformation of dust into narrative medium represents a meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. Cost manifests in the inspectors' involuntary transformation, though agency moments could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of stories as essential sustenance emerges through concrete imagery (story famine, dust learning to speak) rather than declaration. The final image of the city's mist carrying chord fragments while passersby recall dreams "in which stories had never been starving" offers resonant closure without moralizing. Subtext operates through musical intervals encoding grief and rebellion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lyrical voice maintains consistency with musical metaphors and synesthetic descriptions fitting Mila's copyist perspective. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("thistled calm," "secretly luminous") that strain against the POV's grounded occupation. Dialogue is minimal but functional when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("mist curled like forgotten sheet music") but suffers from density overload and occasional register drift. Template patterns appear in parallel constructions ("She realized... She emptied... She began"). The final third maintains better momentum despite some ornamental metaphors that don't constrain action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of encoding stories into musical intervals and teaching dust to narrate offers genuine originality. The story transforms the censorship trope through specific musical mechanics. However, some elements feel workshopped rather than inevitable, and the Ministry antagonist remains generic.</comment>
