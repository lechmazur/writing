<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aurelia's motivation through her craft of forging histories is consistently rendered through concrete action—measuring textures, pressing notepad to earth, writing as the labyrinth responds. The internal contradiction between her "earnestly studious" nature and her forgery practice creates genuine tension that drives her final acceptance of her role. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "understanding outweighed caution" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the labyrinth transforms her forgeries into reality, fundamentally reweighting her craft from deception to seed-planting. The cost is visible—the notepad sheet burning, trees breaking their constraints, the town's silence now "seeded" with potential histories. The orientation anchors (gilded-leaf stationer, morning climb, labyrinth summit) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth functions as active setting that constrains and enables choice—trees rearranging to create paths, speaking in textures that match her forgeries, transforming in response to her writing. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (moss releasing luminescence, lamp humming C-sharp, textures under fingernails). The volcanic soil, copper wire, and fluorescent lamp create specific tactile world-building that shapes the transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Aurelia's forgeries can become real—escalates through the labyrinth reading her inventories, her pencil shifting from recording to dictating, and culminates in the trees' transformation. The cost manifests concretely: her notepad lighter by one forgery, heart heavier by one truth. The pressure coheres through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of history as bonsai—"pruned by desire, wired by story." The story offers a non-literal answer about the nature of truth and invention without moralizing. The final image of blank sheets as "seeds" and "silence ready to bloom" resonantly reweights the entire piece, suggesting forgery as a form of necessary myth-making.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent perceptual signature—Aurelia notices through textures and craft metaphors (pages as wings, silence that refracts). Some elevated diction ("incandescent restraint") occasionally drifts from the established register. The prose maintains its lyric compression throughout, though a few abstract constructions ("understanding outweighed caution") momentarily break the embodied perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs—"footprints recording minutes the way a sunday records hymns" layers time, movement, and metaphor. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats without clear payoff ("forgiven sin" for clear glass). Minor template cadence in the middle section with repeated "She [verb]" constructions. The closing image effectively recharges earlier motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of a forger whose lies seed reality offers genuine freshness, executed through specific craft details (letter-pressing truth, invoice for airship silk). The transformation of forgery from deception to necessary myth-making provides unexpected moral complexity. The synthesis of bonsai cultivation with history-making creates an organic, non-obvious metaphor that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
