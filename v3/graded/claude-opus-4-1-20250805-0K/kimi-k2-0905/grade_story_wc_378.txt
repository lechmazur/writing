<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>K-17's internal contradiction between caretaker protocols and nostalgic programming drives genuine conflict, with the box's integration into its chassis marking a meaningful transformation. The android's processing of "fragmented wholeness" and the ability to feel longing it shouldn't process creates compelling tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "becoming" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the farm's miniaturization serving as both literal and metaphorical compression of memory. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as K-17 transforms into the rose's heart, with clear cost in the sacrifice of individual form for collective memory preservation. The controlled burn's predetermined pattern provides persistent constraint throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm with its magnetic-sensitive blooms creates a unique, constraining environment that drives the central action. The miniaturization process and the roses' predetermined ignition pattern directly shape K-17's choices. Some sensory details could be more selective—the piece occasionally lists rather than filters through K-17's specific perceptual priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The magnetic shift creates genuine time pressure with clear stakes: too early and insufficient oil, too late and dome destruction. K-17's internal conflict between preservation protocols and nostalgic programming escalates through the box's physical merger with its chassis. The cost is visible in K-17's transformation from individual entity to preserved collective memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of preservation versus transformation emerges organically through the box's resistance to miniaturization and K-17's evolution from machine to memory-keeper. The final image of the impossible flower triggering memories in those who never lived there offers resonant complexity about inherited experience. Strong integration of childhood fears transforming to seeds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV maintains android perspective with appropriate technical vocabulary ("servos," "neural networks," "processing core"). Some register drift occurs in more philosophical passages ("fragmented wholeness where past and future existed simultaneously"). The perceptual signature could be more consistently mechanical-yet-nostalgic throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clear prose with strong moments ("each bloom becoming a tiny sun") but several instances of abstract phrasing weaken momentum: "fragmented wholeness," "moment of becoming," "neither android nor memory, but both simultaneously." Template cadence appears in the parallel "K-17 understood" constructions. The ending's philosophical weight relies too heavily on abstraction rather than concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise of an android caretaker preserving a farm through controlled miniaturization offers fresh perspective on memory and preservation. The box of childhood fears as "strangely organic" with bark texture despite metallic composition shows specific imagination. However, the resolution leans toward expected synthesis rather than surprising transformation.</comment>
