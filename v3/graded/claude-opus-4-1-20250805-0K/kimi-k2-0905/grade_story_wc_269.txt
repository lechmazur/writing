<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's characterization succeeds through consistent, embodied details like the rhythmic tapping that becomes both habit and communication method, and her role as "last coral bleaching witness" drives meaningful choices. The transition from documenting loss to discovering hidden preservation shows genuine character evolution with cost. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("delayed revelation stir like an eel") rather than fully embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the tapping rhythm pattern building meaning across beats until the underwater discovery reweights everything. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira realizes her role shifts from witness of loss to keeper of return pathways, with clear cost in years of grief. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the revelation sequence follows earned causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The monitoring station and underwater ruins function as active constraints shaping choices—the station's isolation forces self-reliance, the submersible enables discovery, the stone pillars require the specific atlas fragment. Vivid sensory work in the dive sequence ("headlights cutting green tunnels"). Slightly generic post-apocalyptic elements ("sky first learned to breathe without smoke") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from maintaining abandoned equipment to discovering intentionally hidden knowledge to understanding her transformed role. The tapping pattern's evolution from personal habit to returned signal to activation key shows meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in the years spent documenting death before discovering the preservation path existed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the central metaphor of paths that "disappear" but remain hidden, waiting for the right witness. The holographic reef projection showing what was lost alongside the "Witness Return" label creates resonant meaning without stating morals. The ending image of the station as "a gate left ajar" perfectly reweights the opening's isolation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("white mantis above the lagoon," "ocean clenched its dead reefs like broken teeth") that maintains consistency. Some register elevation in emotional peaks feels slightly forced ("delayed revelation stir like an eel waking"). POV control remains stable throughout with appropriate perceptual filtering for a scientific observer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and good momentum, but several instances of abstract metaphor that obscure rather than clarify ("periodically eternal habit," "assembled beneath the waves"). Some repetitive phrasing around "tapping" and "witness" creates minor loops. The underwater sequence maintains excellent clarity despite complex choreography.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of hidden reef data stored in stone pillars activated by torn atlas pages offers genuine originality. The transformation of scientific monitoring into mystical preservation ritual feels fresh. The specific detail of "three short, two long" as both personal habit and activation code shows strong integration.</comment>
