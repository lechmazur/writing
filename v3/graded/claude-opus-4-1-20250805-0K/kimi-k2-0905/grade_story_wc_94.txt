<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like climbing at dusk with the manuscript and dissolving words into chemicals. Her internal conflict between preservation and transmission plays out in scene, particularly in the choice to dissolve rather than distribute her work. The final disappearance/translation carries visible cost but the emotional progression through extreme events could layer more contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks and density increases that reweight meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's disappearance and the self-restarting timer, with cost visible in "erased" years and abandoned physical form. The orientation anchors (observatory, poet, storm) establish by ~100 words and the single-scene structure maintains coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting directly constrains choices—the dome's isolation enables forbidden acts, the darkroom provides chemical means, and the storm creates both cover and transmission medium. Sensory detail is vivid ("needle-cold droplets," "rain on hot pavement") and filtered through Mara's poet-perception. The recurring "cartography of scars" motif charges the final image where sky and body merge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving forbidden words—escalates from physical manuscript to chemical dissolution to bodily transmission. The eleven-minute timer creates temporal pressure that tightens toward the one-second pause. Cost is visible in the dissolution of text and Mara's final disappearance, though the middle section could deepen the price of choosing transmission over distribution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete interplay of erasure and persistence—"What is erased still orbits." The final image of the self-restarting timer and "cartography of scars [that] redraws itself" offers a non-literal answer about art's survival beyond censorship. Subtext operates richly in the chemical transformation and storm transmission without stating its meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistency with poet-specific perception ("Lightning stitched the sky," "secret ocean"). Purposeful compression and metaphoric density serve the accumulative structure. Some passages edge toward overwriting ("vessel unmoored from jurisdiction") but the perceptual signature remains distinct through pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the darkroom sequence where process mirrors theme. Some ornate passages slow momentum ("a vessel unmoored from jurisdiction, drifting on the uppermost draft of wonder"). The opening and closing lines effectively bookend with the cartography motif, though middle sections occasionally favor elevated diction over propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of censorship, darkroom photography, and storm transmission creates a non-obvious angle on artistic resistance. The specific detail of chemical dissolution as metaphor for textual transformation feels fresh. Risk-taking in the lyric density and ambiguous ending heightens meaning, though some metaphoric combinations feel slightly forced.</comment>
