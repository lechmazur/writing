I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through layered descriptions and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The timekeeper's motivation to understand time's texture after numbers lose meaning is embodied through concrete actions—rubbing the urn fragment, reading price tags, building cairns. His final realization that time is exchanged through sensation rather than measured shows earned transformation with visible cost (trading away the fragment).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the timekeeper understands time as sensory exchange rather than measurement, with the cost visible in trading away his anchoring fragment. The accumulative structure coheres through pattern teaching (price tags as memory vessels) though orientation anchors arrive slightly late (~150 words).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The emerald silo functions as both literal setting and conceptual frame, with sensory details like "dust motes... former digits" and the metallic taste of time passing. Environment constrains choice when the timekeeper must climb to gain perspective, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("green wheat like an unabridged novel").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding time's texture after numerical meaning collapses—deepens through accumulation of sensory discoveries rather than reversals. Cost becomes tangible when he trades his fragment, though escalation under the textural lens could intensify more sharply.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of commerce into narrative exchange, with price tags becoming "soft, unofficial ledgers." The final insight that time is sensation to be exchanged rather than measured reweights all prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with distinctive perceptual signatures ("blood from a bitten minute," "typing Braille against his sternum"). Some register drift occurs ("smuggling memory into commerce") but generally serves the piece's elevated tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but overwriting appears in peak beats ("granular, a fine metallic dust that settled on the tongue of the attentive"). Template cadence emerges in "He [verb]" patterns mid-story, and some metaphors strain clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise of numbers losing meaning and forcing humanity to embed memory in garage sale descriptions is genuinely original. The synthesis of time-as-texture with commerce-as-narrative creates a fresh angle on temporal perception that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
