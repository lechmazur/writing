<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's exhaustion-driven urgency and chronological homesickness create clear, embodied motivation throughout. Her transformation from ache to dissolution of that ache lands with earned cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("chronologically homesick") that isn't fully embodied until later beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memories layer into symphony movements, with the mirrored horizon serving as recurring anchor. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the conductor creating music for future swimmers. Cost is felt through exhaustion and the crumbling nautilus, though the transformation from homesickness to resolution could be more viscerally traced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass spire and frozen lake function as active setting that constrains choices (30-minute window, exhaustion climbing stairs) and enables the symphonic composition. Sensory details like "frost feathers bloom" and "sub-audible B-flat" are specific and purposeful. The mirrored horizon particularly charges the final image as both score and home.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Exhaustion creates genuine time pressure that escalates through physical degradation ("lungs tasted iron," "knees buckled"). The dominant stake of mapping memories before collapse tightens effectively. The cost lands through the nautilus crumbling and her physical collapse, though the emotional cost of resolving homesickness could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the synthesis of memory, music, and time without explicit statement. The fortune "The mirror you seek is the memory you refuse" resonates through action. The ending's gift to the future child reweights all prior material, making the conductor's ephemeral symphony permanent through others.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyric voice maintains consistency with purposeful compression and poetic diction that serves the musical concept. Some elevated language ("Devonian tides," "palimpsest") fits the fortune-writer's literary sensibility. Minor register elevation in places ("chronologically homesick") but largely controlled and atmospheric.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("tuning fork over the frozen lake," "palimpsest of birthdays") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete, particularly in emotional beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of fortune-cookie writer conducting unheard symphonies through mapped memories is genuinely fresh. The glass spire as organ pipe and frozen lake as soundboard shows inventive world-building. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure pays off with the child finding the nautilus shell, creating a temporal loop of artistic legacy.</comment>
