I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds density through layered images and metaphors toward a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist transforms human virtues into data that will become "sweet and meaningless" sap.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's "gently meticulous" nature drives consistent action through measurement and recording, with internal conflict between preserving meaning and accepting its transformation into meaningless data. The final choice to embed the frequencies in the tree shows earned resignation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstraction in how virtues manifest as measurable frequencies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the mercury tablet pressed into the tree trunk, transforming measured dreams into "sweet and meaningless" sap—a clear before/after with conceptual cost. The accumulative structure builds coherently through measurement, decay, and final transmission. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen library's "quartz hush" and crystallizing breath create vivid atmosphere that constrains action (mercury tablet only readable while frozen, breath forming "tiny alphabets"). The magic lantern's projection alcove with warm copper fittings charges the final image. Setting directly enables the measurement method and shapes the protagonist's tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the systematic decay of each virtue—loyalty snapping to static, mercy collapsing to "a single sour note," wonder fighting longest before shattering the slide. The protagonist's quickening measurements as fuel dwindles creates time pressure. Cost is visible in blood coughed onto mercury and the final acceptance of meaninglessness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the transformation of abstract virtues into measurable frequencies that become "sweet and meaningless" sap—a non-literal answer about how meaning dies through quantification. The final image of trees drinking "the last measured dreams of their makers" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevated diction ("luminous vows," "quartz hush") that matches the archival protagonist's perspective. Perceptual signature shows in how she experiences the library's silence as "drowning in reverse." Rhythmic control maintains consistency through measurement sequences without becoming mechanical.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive prose with high information density—most sentences advance both action and atmosphere. Strong rhythm variation and purposeful figurative language ("dandruff from a dying god"). Minor deduction for occasional abstraction around how frequencies manifest physically, but no loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of measuring dying virtues through light frequencies while they transform into tree sap is highly original. The specific synthesis of archival work, spectral measurement, and ecological transformation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the abstract premise pays off through concrete embodiment (+0.3 within band).</comment>
