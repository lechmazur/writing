<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The adjuster's internal conflict between duty and memory drives genuine contradictory impulses throughout, particularly in her recognition of the puppet head triggering visceral memories while maintaining her apocalyptic task. The final transformation into the pane's backing demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost—her physical dissolution enables others' survival.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis: the adjuster accepts eternal imprisonment as the pane's backing, with cost legible in "body eroding like sandstone into salt." The accumulative lens holds as nested lullaby iterations build pressure toward this crystallized sacrifice, though some causal linkages between iterations could be tighter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse's spiral architecture actively constrains movement ("nested patterns of salt-stained iron") and the pane of hush functions as micro-setting that enables the central transformation. The doomsday clock as bleeding organism rather than mechanism elevates the world-building, though some spatial transitions between realms lack clarity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the accumulative pattern of nested lullabies, each iteration deepening the cost until "she would remain here, voice eternally whispering." The clock's retreat ("hand retreating one tick") demonstrates tangible victory achieved through the adjuster's agency, with the price of eternal dissolution clearly marked.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The central theme of imperfection as salvation ("imperfection was the only song worth singing") emerges organically through the broken puppet's "beautifully flawed crescent" and crystallizes in the final image of children glimpsing "the lullaby's outline." The nested lives concept avoids abstraction by grounding each iteration in specific sensory detail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout ("dusk caught inside it and refracted into every possible color of almost"), with syntax modulating under pressure—shorter fragments during the transformation sequence. The lyric compression serves the accumulative design, though occasional opacity ("crossing the hush of time's final ripple") risks clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("mercury pumping beneath numerals that bled"), though some figurative density in peak beats approaches overwriting ("bruised purple by the approaching midnight"). The recursive structure avoids feeling repetitive through careful variation, and the final "I am here" triplet lands with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of apocalyptic duty with intimate lullaby memory creates a non-obvious emotional architecture rarely seen. The nested lives concept and transformation into the pane's backing demonstrate bold structural risk that heightens stakes while maintaining clarity—particularly the paradox of silence becoming music "on the far side of hearing."</comment>
