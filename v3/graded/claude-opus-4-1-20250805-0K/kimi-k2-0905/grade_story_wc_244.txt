<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kit's desperately jocular armor and internal contradiction between helping others while battling personal loneliness create genuine complexity. The transformation from isolation to community leadership is earned through concrete micro-choices (sharing the moon rock, teaching reciprocity). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around loneliness that could be more embodied, particularly in the middle section.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Kit's departure, with visible cost in leaving the community he created. The accumulative/textural lens holds as loneliness transforms through pattern accumulation (moon seeds multiplying, stories trading, ivy growing). The closure image of the station "waving with every leaf" while Kit carries forward the recipe creates undeniable emotional cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The disused railway station with its backward-moving clock and ivy-choked platform constrains choices and becomes transformed by the moon seeds into a living sanctuary. The silver-leafed saplings that "chimed when wind passed through" and ivy that "braids itself into trellis arches" create vivid sensory detail. The setting actively participates in closure as it waves goodbye, though some middle passages could ground action more specifically.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of curing loneliness escalates from Kit's solitary chess game to community gathering to necessary departure. The moon rock's multiplication and the growing crowd create meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. Cost is visible in Kit's departure when "the timeframe had arrived" - he must leave the community he built to preserve its magic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of reciprocity emerges organically through concrete actions: sharing the moon rock, trading stories for solitude, the seeds multiplying. The final image of loneliness "kept in lost-property forever" offers a resonant non-literal answer to whether isolation can be cured. The moon rock fragment returning to Kit while Lila "knew the recipe" creates perfect thematic closure about cycles of giving and receiving.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("ivy-choked clock," "carriages that once carried soldiers to dances and dancers to wars"). The desperately jocular tone modulates effectively from forced humor to genuine warmth. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction that slightly exceeds Kit's established register ("catalyze memories," "anarchic") though these moments don't obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong sentence variety and rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some minor register drift into elevated diction ("improbable rumor chains," "beautiful chaos") and occasional abstract phrasing around loneliness that could be more concrete. The prose serves the accumulative design well with purposeful repetition of key images.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The moon rock that multiplies when shared and cures loneliness through story exchange offers fresh transformation of familiar material. The backwards-moving clock and ivy that spells departure times in untranslatable Latin create memorable specificity. The concept of a "swap meet of solitude" and loneliness as something to be deposited in "lost-property" shows genuine originality in treating abstract concepts.</comment>
