<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The guard's motivation emerges through embodied action—pressing palms to clocks, carrying archives, speaking names as charms—rather than explained interiority. The final choice to plant the clock and cultivate sparks shows clear agency with visible cost (the children becoming pollen-light beings). However, internal contradiction remains understated; we see duty but not competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered imagery (clock, strongbox, poppies, pollen-children) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the guard plants the clock to enable divergent time. Cost is visible—the children exist only as light-beings, the forest only as sparks. The pattern teaches itself through "occasionally everywhere" repetition and wave function logic, though the opening could anchor "who" more clearly before line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glowing dune with phosphorescent poppies creates a vivid post-apocalyptic landscape that constrains choices—the guard must work with what remains (ash, light, memory). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "petals flickering like defective film frames," "steel strongbox scorched black, its lock melted into a screaming mouth." The micro-setting of the chess clock against the guard's heart becomes the mechanism for time's unzipping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving what remains after catastrophic loss—deepens through accumulation rather than reversal. Pressure coheres as the guard moves from passive carrying to active cultivation, with the clock's transformation (frozen to moving, single midnight to divergent seconds) marking the tightening. The cost is legible but arrives late; earlier beats could establish what the guard risks or sacrifices to achieve this preservation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete interplay of preservation and transformation—lullabies persist without throats, cargo travels by wave, burnt forests meet children in "the hush between heartbeats." The final image of light transferred from poppies to children carrying sparks "toward the next unlit corner" offers a non-literal answer about continuity through change. No explicit moralizing; meaning accretes through particular images.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent lyric-fabulist register with controlled rhythm: "The dreamless freight guard pressed his palm to the chess clock frozen at midnight." POV distance remains stable in limited third, with selective perception focused on transformation and light. The phrase "occasionally everywhere" becomes a taught pattern that pays off. Some register elevation ("divergent archive," "fractured lullaby") fits the mythic tone though occasionally strains.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery, though density occasionally overwhelms clarity—"probability clouds condensing into small warm hands" requires re-reading. Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere and meaning simultaneously. The recurring "occasionally everywhere" creates intentional rhythm. Some figurative language borders on overwrought ("paper lanterns," "constellation of small glowing figures") but serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The piece synthesizes post-apocalyptic loss with quantum mechanics ("wave functions," "probability clouds") and folklore (naming as charm, light-beings) in a non-obvious way. The specific detail of a chess clock keeping divergent time for both the dead and the living offers conceptual freshness. While the lyric-fabulist mode is familiar, the particular combination of freight guard as psychopomp and time as splittable substance shows genuine invention.</comment>
