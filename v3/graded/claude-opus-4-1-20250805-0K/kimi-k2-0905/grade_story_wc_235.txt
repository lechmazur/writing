I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** with elements of Hybrid (some causal linkage), as the piece builds through layered images of time-confusion, dream-reality blurring, and recursive chronicling toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chronicler's internal contradiction between documenting/escaping time's wheel drives authentic tension, particularly in "grief for a life she had not yet finished failing to live." The jealousy of past selves and the eagle-flight duality create genuine psychological complexity. Minor deduction for some abstraction in middle passages that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the stone monument and acceptance of the chronicling wheel, with visible cost in "splinters in her palms as she clung." The accumulative build through scroll→grave→flight→erasure coheres well. Deduction for mild ambiguity in the middle third where the time-confusion could be more precisely anchored to present action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cabin-as-pressure-chamber works beautifully, with cedar smoke, iron door sparks, and dreams pawing at windows creating visceral constraint. The snow erasing the scroll provides crucial environmental agency at closure. The mountain's mineral indifference charges the thematic stakes throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal mortality to the nature of narrative itself, with the scroll's dare creating immediate pressure. The cost lands in accepting erasure as continuation and leaving the stone monument. Some middle passages could tighten the pressure between chronicling and escaping.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the wheel/ladder metaphor and "every story ends mid-sentence." The erasure-as-continuation insight and final image of the unrecognized monument provide resonant, non-literal answers. Exceptional integration of chronicling-as-both-trap-and-purpose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice balances lyric compression ("autumn tongues," "feral nostalgia bite") with philosophical precision. The perceptual signature of time-confusion manifests consistently through paradoxical observations. Excellent control of psychic distance, especially in the eagle-flight sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong sentence-level propulsion with varied syntax supporting the accumulative build. Information density high throughout, particularly in images doing multiple jobs ("sparks write brief constellations"). Minor deduction for occasional abstraction that could be more concrete ("chaos inside her settle").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The time-loop/prophecy structure with the future-dated scroll is genuinely fresh. "Feral nostalgia" as grief for unlived futures transforms a familiar concept. The risk of the incomplete ending ("Before sleep took her") heightens the wheel metaphor perfectly.</comment>
