I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and recursive time loops, with density shifts reweighting meaning at closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between fixing and falling operates throughout, with the final choice to "keep ascending, cracks and all" earned through accumulated pressure. The ghost child's transformation from transparent to solid enough to cast a shadow effectively externalizes her internal shift. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "woman who fixes and the woman who falls" formulation that leans toward diagnostic language.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise - Mara's decision to leave the mainspring and accept the ticket stub crystallizes her stance with clear cost ("weightless, burdened, alive"). The time loop revelation creates genuine causality that recontextualizes her earlier arrival. The orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the accumulative lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The circus setting constrains choices brilliantly - the desk becomes ladder, ceiling tiles hide temporal cracks, dust patterns serve as navigation. The mainspring barrel's "brass tarnished to the color of old blood" and tickets dated "ADMIT ONE TO THE SKY" create specific texture that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through deepening recognition: ghosts arrive → time crack discovered → loop revealed → choice crystallized. The dominant stake (breaking vs. accepting the loop) tightens when Mara realizes "the ghosts were not haunting the office; they were haunting the moment she would decide to leave." Cost is visible in the "weightless burden" that returns transformed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The vertical metaphor (elevators/falling/ascending) resonates throughout without becoming heavy-handed. "Every cable she tightened only postponed the fall, never prevented it" emerges from concrete particulars. The final ticket stub transforms from circus artifact to existential pass, earning its thematic weight through accumulated imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature: Mara reads dust "like a detective reading Braille," sees ghosts "the way frost patterns are faint." The prose modulates effectively - shorter fragments during the ghost encounters, longer meditation during the choice moment. Free indirect style clean throughout: "Why do you still fix what climbs when you can see what falls?"</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control with purposeful variation - "The overhead fluorescent buzz died off at 3:07 a.m." sets precise tone. Information density high: "brass tarnished to the color of old blood, its coiled heart intact, ticking so softly only the dead could hear." Minor deduction for "weightless burden" appearing three times, though it gains meaning each iteration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The time-loop-through-architecture conceit feels fresh, particularly the "crack in time" being literal and metaphorical simultaneously. The synthesis of elevator technician encountering vertical metaphysics transforms occupational detail into existential exploration. Risk-taking in the recursive structure and ghost-vision heightens rather than obscures meaning (+0.3 within band).</comment>
