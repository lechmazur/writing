<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The historian's journey from individual burden to communal sharing shows clear motivation through concrete choices. Her internal conflict between preservation and erasure manifests in embodied moments like "fingers traced symbols" and the locket transformation. However, some emotional transitions feel compressed, and the shift to teaching survivors lacks the granular struggle that earlier beats achieve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the historian transforms from solitary keeper to communal teacher, with visible cost in "weathered hands" and the veil becoming a shared banner. The pattern of "atoms of nostalgia" accumulates meaning from dust to wings to lanterns. Minor orientation delay (who/where anchors arrive late) costs some clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda functions as both setting and constraint, multiplying "like guilt" and shrinking to locket size, directly shaping her choices. Sensory details like "air tasted of copper tears" and "screaming equations" create visceral atmosphere. The wasteland transition and survivor settlement feel slightly underdeveloped compared to the archive's rich specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to purify/erase or preserve corrupted memory—deepens through her discovery that "purification meant erasing the very memories that made her who she was." The exit door requiring backward walking while facing forward provides concrete obstacle. However, the resolution with survivors lacks the pressure intensity of the archive sequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the transformation of "atoms of nostalgia" from burden to "beautiful contamination of being human." The final image of the veil as banner and pagoda as compass offers non-literal answer to memory's purpose. The concept that truth "will save you and destroy you in the same breath" resonates throughout without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm in phrases like "each speck a memory of the world before the end of innocence." Some register elevation feels unmotivated for the POV ("beautiful contamination," "symmetric satisfaction"). The perceptual signature weakens in the survivor section where voice becomes more generic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strong figurative language ("atoms of nostalgia drifted like luminous dust") creates texture but occasionally overwhelms clarity. Template cadence appears in repetitive "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Information density is high in the archive section but thins during the survivor sequence where several paragraphs could be compressed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of memory as physical "atoms of nostalgia" that transform from dust to wings to lanterns offers fresh angle on post-apocalyptic archive trope. The door that "only opened for those who walked backward while facing forward" provides specific, earned paradox. The synthesis of preservation through "beautiful contamination" rather than purification feels inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
