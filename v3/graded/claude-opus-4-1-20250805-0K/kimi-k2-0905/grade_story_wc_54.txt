I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through layered imagery and metaphorical density rather than causal plot mechanics, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Alya's engineering work becomes a metaphor for resurrecting hope through patient reclamation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Alya's characterization succeeds through consistent embodied details (speaking aloud "to keep the silence honest," the single laugh "like a valve clearing its throat") and her engineering mindset filtering perception. The final choice to redirect flows represents earned agency, though internal contradiction could be sharper during the middle beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the terminal's resurrection mirrors internal renewal, with visible cost in the abandoned state and effort required. The accumulative structure coheres well through the hydraulic/flow metaphor system, though the hologram sequence slightly disrupts the textural build.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of setting-as-character, where the terminal's "Martian vermillion" rust and "cathedral of dry pumps" constrains choices and mirrors theme. The environment actively shapes Alya's tactics (using glycol runoff, working with existing infrastructure), and spatial choreography remains crystal clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes accumulate effectively through the engineering challenge becoming a metaphor for reclaiming abandoned futures. The pressure deepens when the sculpture reanimates and the hologram appears, though the conflict remains primarily internal/atmospheric rather than dramatically opposed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the maze/navigation metaphor system and the contrast between departure/return. The ending's "portable meridian pointing not skyward but inward" brilliantly reweights the entire piece without stating a moral, and the carnival/terminal juxtaposition creates layered meaning about transient versus enduring hope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains consistent engineering-poetic register ("equations shimmered on the board, their chalk lines fluttering like prayer flags"). The perceptual signature is strong - Alya sees in vectors, equations, and fluid dynamics - and the prose rhythm modulates effectively with the story's contemplative pace.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("each corridor a vector that doubled back on itself like a Möbius confession"). Some metaphorical density borders on excess ("zero-mass comet" for tickets), but the prose maintains strong momentum and avoids loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering procedural with lyric meditation on hope/abandonment. The specific detail work (biometric gates, glycol systems) grounds the metaphorical layer, and the risk of sustaining this dense poetic-technical register pays off in creating a unique reading experience.</comment>
