I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's precognitive curse creates genuine internal contradiction—seeing futures he cannot change while still acting through them. His relationship with Mira drives meaningful choices, particularly the promise that shapes the entire narrative. The final acceptance that "promises are meant to be broken by understanding" shows earned character evolution with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based closure through the painted rocks sequence. The Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly—understanding becomes witnessing, promises transform through comprehension. Cost is visible in Mira's death serving as the "final equation" and the eels dissolving into light. Minor orientation wobble with the friction-disappearing worldbuilding that never fully pays off causally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tidal bluff and aurora create atmospheric pressure, while the mathematical rock placement constrains specific choices. Star dust and painted rocks function as micro-settings that shape the ritual. The friction-free world concept adds texture but doesn't fully integrate with the central action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—fulfilling the promise to understand sacred patterns—drives consistent pressure through mathematical placement and star dust activation. Escalation occurs through the rocks' resonance building to the eels' transformation. Cost manifests in accepting that understanding requires surrender rather than comprehension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pattern/understanding paradox without explicit moralizing. The ending's resonant answer—that sacred patterns must be witnessed rather than understood—reweights all prior material. Mira's final words about patterns existing "in the spaces between" pays off beautifully in the eels swimming through dimensional gaps.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Voice maintains lyrical consistency though occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("crystalline moment," "geometry of absence"). The perceptual signature—Elias experiencing his curse as "helpless clarity"—is distinctive but sometimes overwhelmed by figurative density.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of beauty ("aurora above the tidal bluff shimmered like a borrowed dawn") but suffers from density overload—nearly every sentence contains figurative language. Some mixed metaphors ("constellation of collapsed star dust began to fade") and occasional register drift into academic abstraction ("interference patterns," "mathematical sequences") reduce clarity in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The precognitive curse inverted—seeing unchangeable futures while still acting through them—offers fresh perspective on fate/agency. The synthesis of eel herding, mathematical patterns, and star dust creates an original mythology. The transformation of understanding into witnessing provides non-obvious resolution.</comment>
