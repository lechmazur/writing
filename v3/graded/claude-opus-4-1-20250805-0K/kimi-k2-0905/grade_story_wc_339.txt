<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between holding on and letting go is embodied through concrete actions with the snow globe and notebook, with her final choice carrying visible emotional cost. The characterization of Death as "Elias" who borrowed her brother's face adds specificity, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("physics of letting go"). The revelation about her great-grandmother effectively compounds personal stakes with historical weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's act of release, with the snow globe's dissolution and her emergence "irrevocably lighter" marking clear before/after states with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as symbolic objects and family history layer to create the final transformation. The orientation anchors (underwater library, Mara's ritual, Death's presence) establish clearly by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sunken library setting constrains choices through water pressure and dissolution, with the snow globe's "hairline crack" enabling the pivotal release moment. Sensory detail ("barnacle-crusted threshold," "silver balloon of breath") creates vivid underwater atmosphere. The setting functions as more than backdrop, actively shaping the physics of letting go through brine, pressure gauges, and the dissolving books.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—releasing the weight of inherited loss—escalates from ritual notation to the revelation about 1914 and her great-grandmother, forcing Mara's final choice. The snow globe's transformation from suspended to sinking parallels Mara's internal shift, with the cost visible in her trembling hand and the "irrevocably lighter" emergence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ending reweights the entire piece through "some things are found only so they can be let go," transforming discovery into release without stating a moral. The physics metaphor ("mass times acceleration equals story over time") and the snow globe's dissolution create layered meaning about inheritance and letting go. The theme emerges through concrete objects and actions rather than abstract statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled metaphoric density ("Pacific silence," "spectral ionosphere"). Some passages risk overwriting ("melancholy that followed was sophisticated, almost sweet, like a violin chord resolving into minor") but generally serve the piece's meditative tone. POV remains stable with Mara throughout, though occasional omniscient touches appear ("already forgetting the syllables").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is generally high with most sentences advancing multiple purposes, though some metaphoric passages edge toward purple ("aluminum flakes swirling like constellations being named for the first time"). The prose occasionally loops concepts ("physics of letting go" appears multiple times). Strong opening and closing lines bracket the piece effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of Amelia Earhart's disappearance with personal family loss through an underwater library creates an original frame. The personification of Death as someone who "borrowed her brother's face" offers a fresh angle on grief. While the "letting go" theme is familiar, the specific execution through maritime archaeology and snow globe physics provides distinctive texture.</comment>
