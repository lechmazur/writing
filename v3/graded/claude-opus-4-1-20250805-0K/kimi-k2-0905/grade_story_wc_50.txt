<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ansel's motivation to reverse-engineer time theft is clear and deepens through embodied perception ("breath clouding," physical interaction with the timer). The final choice to lock away wonder shows genuine internal conflict between reason and mystery. Minor deduction for slightly abstract resolution of time restoration without more visceral cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through Conceptual Repricing—wonder stored rather than killed, with visible cost in Ansel's "tailored skin" of new seconds. The pattern of echoes thinning and time skipping establishes early and pays off through the reversed timer's silence. Slight deduction for the magical time-moth release lacking more grounded physical consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The marble cavern functions as more than setting—its veins and reflections actively constrain Ansel's method and enable the solution. Exquisite detail like "each echo arrived thinner, as if it had paid a toll of weight" makes the environment essential to the mechanics. The cavern's architecture directly shapes the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as Ansel discovers the timer converted echoes to torque, forcing him to feed it silence instead—a meaningful reversal. The cost manifests in lost hours returning as "translucent moths" and the weight of seconds on his ribs. Minor deduction for the village restoration feeling slightly detached from Ansel's personal cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the tension between storing wonder versus killing it, with the cellar becoming a metaphor for preserving mystery within reason. The final image of sounds "wearing the clothes of their own absence" resonates without stating a moral. Exceptional integration of harvest/echo motif throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("wounded season's last sun like frost on a dying breath"). Perceptual signature strong in how Ansel notices reflection angles and fractured twins. Clean focalization throughout with purposeful compression that never obscures clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The locksmith knelt, breath clouding, and traced a crack"). Strong figurative coherence throughout. Minor deductions for occasional elevated diction ("crepuscular hours") and slight redundancy in describing echo mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exceptional synthesis of time-as-echo concept with the locksmith's professional lens creating fresh angle on temporal disruption. The solution of feeding silence instead of sound shows genuine ingenuity. Risk-taking in the lyrical approach heightens rather than obscures meaning (+0.3 within band).</comment>
