<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied details like feeling the pulse of dying walls and the "luminescent ache" migrating to his chest. His contradictory impulses—seeking to paint what no longer exists while accepting dissolution—act simultaneously in scene, particularly in the mirror sequence where he creates a door "only the drowning could open." The final choice to step through carries visible cost as "salt sealed his eyes," though some interiority edges toward abstract philosophizing rather than concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elian's transformation from seeking to recreate a lost face to becoming "a self-portrait rendered in motion," with clear cost as he drowns. The accumulative/textural lens holds as pressure builds through the lighthouse's physical collapse, narrowing shelves, and fragmenting reality. The orientation anchors (lighthouse, artist, lost beloved) establish by ~120 words, and causality tracks cleanly through his descent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The collapsing lighthouse functions as both setting and constraint, with walls pressing closer and shelves cracking to create urgency that drives Elian's choices. Vivid sensory details like "worm-gnawed atlases whose margins bled contradictory coastlines" and "mildewed breath that tasted of shipwrecked letters" create atmosphere while the spatial choreography of his descent remains clear. The environment directly shapes the final choice as the structure's imminent collapse forces his passage through the mirror.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elian's need to capture/recreate what's lost—tightens effectively as the lighthouse contracts and time pressure mounts with "the lighthouse would collapse before sunrise." His agency drives the escalation through active choices: seeking the tarot box, reassembling fragments, touching the mirror. The cost is legible as he accepts drowning to complete his artistic vision, though the conflict could benefit from one more concrete obstacle between finding the box and the mirror.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the recurring questions about memory, absence, and artistic creation, culminating in the villagers' unanswered question about where art ends and world begins. The fragmented tarot cards mirror the impossibility of reconstructing the past whole, while the final image of waves that "paint and unpaint the shore" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates effectively through images like the "negative space she once occupied" rather than direct statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm that modulates with pressure, from contemplative ("If memory is a coastline") to urgent during the collapse. The perceptual signature—an artist's attention to light, color, and composition—remains distinct throughout. The rhetorical questions function as character-specific thought pattern rather than affectation, though occasional phrases like "necessary darkness" and "luminescent ache" risk becoming overwrought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, and the prose achieves moments of genuine beauty like "volumes of star-charts slid into the stairwell, charting spirals that led down instead of up." However, the repeated "questions rhetorical questions" construction appears twice verbatim, creating a noticeable loop. Some metaphorical density in peak beats ("luminescent ache migrate from card to chest") occasionally obscures rather than clarifies, and abstract philosophizing sometimes replaces concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of a portrait artist seeking to paint absence through fragmented tarot cards in a sinking lighthouse offers genuine originality. The transformation of the expected resolution—instead of recreating his beloved, he becomes a living artwork himself—feels earned and non-obvious. The specific synthesis of artistic creation with physical dissolution avoids template plots, though the "artist grieving lost love" frame is familiar territory elevated by particular execution.</comment>
