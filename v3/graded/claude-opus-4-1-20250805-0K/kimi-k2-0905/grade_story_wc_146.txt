I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This piece operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens. The story builds through layered imagery and ritual repetition rather than causal plot mechanics. The seven circuits, the fork's transformation from matte to gloss, and the accumulation of ghostly figures all create density that culminates in Elian's transformation into the tenth bell—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's characterization succeeds through embodied detail ("the hollow inside his chest where his own bell once hung") and his transformation from tuner to bell shows genuine cost. The "infinitely patient" trait manifests in action through the seven circuits and final sacrifice. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract treatment of the north ward's "unspoken guilt."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elian becomes the tenth bell, with visible cost ("transparent at the edges"). The accumulative structure coheres through ritual repetition and the fork's progressive transformation. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and pays it off, though the north ward resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric control through "wild hush," "bruised clanks," and the visceral "pressure behind the eyes, the way moonlight tastes." The cobblestones and archway constrain Elian's ritual path and the bellflowers charge the final transformation. Setting actively shapes the magical mechanics throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative density: seven circuits, fork brightening, dust becoming architecture, then the north ward resistance requiring Elian's heart-rhythm sacrifice. The cost is legible when he shatters into black sand and becomes the tenth bell, though the north ward's "unspoken guilt" needed sharper definition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of restoration through sacrifice emerges organically from Elian's transformation into what the town lost. The bellflowers with "tiny clappers that rang with the heartbeat" and his becoming the tenth bell create resonant non-literal answers about healing requiring the healer to become part of what's healed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("memories becoming architecture, cartilage knitting bone"). The perceptual signature remains consistent through synesthetic details. Minor compression in the final paragraph where "heel-toe, heel-toe" effectively echoes but the syntax slightly rushes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong prose control with varied rhythm and high information density. Phrases like "smoke that had forgotten how to rise" and "apologizing for arriving late" show originality. Slight deduction for the abstract phrasing around "unspoken guilt" and minor redundancy in "shared balance" appearing multiple times.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of bell-tuning as place-healing through Tempris. The transformation of tuner into bell and the specific detail of "bellflowers sprouting...with tiny clappers" create memorable non-obvious imagery. The ritual structure with seven circuits for quarter-tones shows deep conceptual integration.</comment>
