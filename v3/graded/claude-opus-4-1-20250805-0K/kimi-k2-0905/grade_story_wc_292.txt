<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's nervously confident duality manifests through concrete actions—drumming the copper nail while pursuing forbidden research, accepting exile to seek truth. The contradiction between her methodical decoding work and trembling hands under "gravitational pull of legacy" creates genuine complexity. Internal conflict peaks when she chooses to stay after reversal is granted, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the compressed timeframe.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern teaching (salt-cipher, micro-maps) that builds to Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara transforms exile into permanent archive-keeping. The closure reweights the Reversible Exile Act from punishment to purposeful mission with clear cost—staying in isolation. Minor orientation wobble around "boiling quadrant" and some timeline compression, but causality holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Weather Station Cirrus-9 actively constrains choices through its isolation, restricted zones, and equipment (weather array, dirigible). The "spongey plankwalk," mildewed walls, and screaming barometers create visceral atmosphere that mirrors thematic decay/renewal. Setting enables the crucial discovery through proximity to the wreck site, though some technical details feel slightly generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest (finding ship's log) through confrontation with Voss to the discovery that ministers' ancestors were saved by Edda's sacrifice—a revelation that reweights the entire exile system. The "nine nautical miles" proximity creates urgency and possibility. Cost is visible in Mara's choice to remain in exile, though middle pressure could tighten slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring question "What truth do you need the wind to remember?" which transforms from personal query to institutional challenge. The copper nail's evolution from death marker to living stylus, and the final image of coordinates refracted through rain, creates non-literal resonance about memory preservation without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with specialized vocabulary ("plankwalk," "salt-cipher," "verdigris") and controlled rhythm that accelerates during discovery sequences. POV remains stable with clean focalization throughout. Some register elevation in places ("gravitational pull of legacy") slightly exceeds Mara's established lexicon, and dialogue between Mara and Voss could carry more subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "sky's spongey dread glowed the color of old pennies." Some density issues with stacked modifiers ("nervously confident hands trembled") and occasional abstraction ("anonymous dread"). The compound structure of several sentences creates slight momentum drag, particularly in exposition-heavy middle sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival mystery with climate catastrophe creates non-obvious angle on legacy and institutional memory. The Reversible Exile Act concept and salt-cipher methodology show genuine invention. Risk-taking in the dense, lyrical approach mostly succeeds, though some worldbuilding elements feel slightly familiar from cli-fi genre conventions.</comment>
