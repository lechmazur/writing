<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's internal conflict between professional duty and personal grief drives authentic choices, particularly his gift of the drawer pull as transformative gesture. The guards' naming of fears and Seris's vulnerability about the lullaby create genuine emotional texture. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("recycled mistakes," "futures not ledgers") that edges toward conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the parapet transforms from site of division to "forge" of possibility, with clear cost in Kael's "pocket lighter...heart fuller." The moon-phase timing system provides causal constraint throughout. Slight deduction for the rope ritual feeling somewhat abstract despite its symbolic weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The parapet setting excellently constrains choice (no chains allowed, exposed position forcing vulnerability) and charges the final image of stones holding "faint warmth." Sensory details like "storm-worn windblown," "salt and regret," and "mist thicker than any dungeon wall" create lived atmosphere. The moon's felt pulse through stone adds tactile grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through moon-phase timing creating narrow window for mercy, culminating in the rope ritual that forces each participant to name and release grievances. Cost is visible in the transformed coastlines "no longer aiming cannons." Slight softness in how easily the guards lower spears without deeper resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The drawer pull transforms from prison relic to key for "drawers thought rusted shut," embodying the theme of recycling trauma into wisdom. The final forge metaphor ("between apology and forgiveness lies not a gulf but a forge") resonates without stating a moral. Strong thematic coherence through moon cycles, tides, and rhythms of grievance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("moon remembers tide," "squid grief") and consistent elevated register fitting the negotiator's perspective. Some moments edge toward overwrought ("fermented mistakes," "exile possibilities") but rhythm control during the ritual sequence is excellent. Clean POV maintenance throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly lands ("bruised dawn," "blame thinned to gauze") but occasional overwriting ("possibilities previously exiled," "grief blooming like squid grief"). Information density high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deduction for abstract phrasing that occasionally dulls immediacy ("trafficking in futures," "recycled mistakes").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of prisoner exchange with lunar timing and ritual untethering creates non-obvious angle on diplomatic negotiation. The drawer pull as transferred talisman and the rope ritual feel earned rather than convenient. Some safety in the too-neat resolution where both sides immediately transform.</comment>
