<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to illuminate value in the mundane drives concrete micro-choices (reading water patterns, speaking aloud to objects, hurling the prism) with visible cost in her private ritual. Internal complexity emerges through embodied perception rather than labels, though peak moments edge toward abstraction ("noctilucent reckonings," "ribbons of silver fire").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (three rings → three memories → three spoken acknowledgments) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's ritual transforms the town's windows. Cost is felt through the "private craft" sacrificed to communal healing, though the mechanism of prism-to-windows transformation strains physical causality slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting functions as active participant: the harbor's condensation drip initiates the ritual, water rings become a readable text, and the prism channels atmospheric light to heal windows. Pearl Bay's specific details (kelp and rust scent, pier posts, black mirror pond) create lived-in texture that constrains Mara's actions and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (paying beauty's debt to the ordinary) deepens through accumulating recognitions, with escalation via the prism's transformation from private tool to communal gift. Cost emerges in sacrificing the prism itself, though pressure could tighten more sharply between recognition and action phases.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (chipped teacup, dented harmonica, scar) that gain luminous value through Mara's ritual attention. The ending's image of light healing windows offers a non-literal answer about how attention transforms the mundane, though "debts of beauty unpaid" edges toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm and distinctive perceptual signature ("storms slid off them like apologies"). Some elevated diction ("noctilucent reckonings," "auroral residue") occasionally strains against the harbor-worker context, but syntax and imagery cohere to create atmospheric texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose density is high with purposeful figurative language serving the accumulative design, though phrases like "prism atrium in mist" appear twice without clear pattern-teaching. Information density remains strong throughout with minimal scaffold, and the final image of Mara as "a sail that had learned the wind's true name" resonates without overreach.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of harbor glazier as spiritual intermediary reading water patterns offers fresh specificity, transforming the craftsperson archetype through ritual particulars. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and extended metaphor system heightens meaning, though some images ("ribbons of silver fire spelling out debts") trend toward familiar poetic territory.</comment>
