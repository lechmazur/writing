<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arlen's internal contradiction between his dream of measuring "glacial hush" and his need to abandon it drives genuine conflict, with embodied details like "cradling it with excruciatingly gentle hands, the way one might lift a sleeping infant who will never wake." The motivation is clear and consistent, though some passages drift toward abstract reflection rather than embodied experience ("the dream had never been about building, but about listening").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Arlen abandons his physical clock but discovers "the clock he sought had always been ticking inside this hush," with visible cost in leaving the brass corpse behind. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and the final cadence shift. Minor orientation delay (who Arlen is emerges gradually) doesn't harm closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt and ruined observatory create vivid sensory anchors ("crystal tesserae glimmered, catching the newborn light in violet fractures") that constrain choice—Arlen must physically kneel and place the clock on these specific stones. The setting actively participates in the transformation, "sealing the memory with a silence more precise than any gear."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—making peace with abandoned ambition—deepens through Arlen's physical surrender of the clock, with cost visible in "its weight had transferred into the stones, into the bones of the observatory, into the hollow beneath his ribs." The escalation is gentle but meaningful under the accumulative lens, though it lacks a sharp reversal or heightened opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of accepting failure and finding peace through surrender emerges through concrete actions (placing the clock, removing the pendulum) rather than statement. The final realization that "the clock he sought had always been ticking inside this hush" reweights all prior material without moralizing, and the image of future apprentices inventing "stories of a saint who tried to stop time for love" adds ironic distance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice maintains a distinctive lyric register with controlled rhythm ("Each breath tasted of moss and iron, of promises once wound like mainsprings inside his chest, now slack") and consistent perceptual signature focused on stillness and mechanical metaphors. The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, though occasionally edges toward purple in less crucial moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure, but some passages contain ornamental figurative language that doesn't advance pressure ("a small suicide he understood" for a water droplet). Information density is high in key beats, though middle sections occasionally loop concepts ("glacial hush" variations). No major artifacts or scaffolding issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of a clock that measures "the glacial hush between heartbeats of the world" offers a fresh angle on time and ambition themes. The specific synthesis of clockmaking with geological time creates memorable imagery, though the execution sometimes relies on familiar literary patterns (artist abandoning dream, return to meaningful place).</comment>
