<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her gift creates consistent character logic, but interiority relies on abstract descriptors ("ordinary magic," "softly adaptive") rather than embodied contradiction. The baby curl anchors her motivation concretely. Her final smile shows earned satisfaction, though the children's transformation feels externally imposed rather than emerging from their own struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—children carry "after-echo" that changes their relationship to wonder, with cost implied through "small discomfort." The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds toward the eclipse moment. However, the children's perspective shift happens TO them rather than through their agency, weakening the causality at the crucial turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains the ritual (ridge location, eclipse timing, Listening Stone) and charges the final image through "roots next dreamed." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("silver sage whose leaves held the faint savor of rain"). The ridge functions as both physical space and metaphysical conduit, with spatial choreography remaining clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restoring wonder in children) is signaled early and tightens through the eclipse ritual, with Elara's whistle nearly failing as genuine pressure point. Cost appears in the "small discomfort" children will carry. However, the children remain passive recipients rather than agents, and their transformation lacks earned resistance or struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete tension between technology ("eyes glazed over screens") and organic wonder, avoiding explicit moralizing. The "after-echo like a pebble in a shoe" offers a non-literal answer about how wonder persists through discomfort. The baby curl's darkening "absorbing new stories" subtly reweights the opening without stating meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with selective perception ("the ridge inhale with her, a single lung of earth and woman"). POV distance remains stable without head-hopping. Some elevated diction ("cautious exuberance," "filament of sound") fits the mythic register, though occasionally strains toward purple prose in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and information density, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some overwriting appears in metaphor clusters ("black disc crowned with white fire," "color streaming from their fingertips like silk scarves"). The "softly adaptive" repetition works as pattern but the abstract modifier weakens specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The music therapist using sound magic to restore wonder offers a fresh angle on the healer archetype. The eclipse-as-ritual-moment and baby curl as anchor show specific choices. However, the core premise of technology-dulled children needing external magical intervention follows familiar templates without significant transformation through lived detail.</comment>
