I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through pattern accumulation, rope-reading as metaphor for cultural preservation, and a final image that reweights the entire piece.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ari's motivation crystallizes through concrete embodied details—fingers coaxing rope, pockets bulging with seed envelopes, the physical press of fulgurite against ribs. Her "infinite patience" manifests in specific actions rather than labels, and the final choice to plant the seed in defiance carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Ari's act of planting—a gesture that transforms preservation from archival to living practice, with the green shoot as proof. The accumulative structure builds through rope-reading, confrontation, and escape, each adding density to the central stake of cultural preservation versus bureaucratic control.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting operates as active constraint—the golden dock becomes planting ground, fog enables escape, fulgurite glass preserves both lightning and knowledge. The final image of "new fibers of light glassy under sun" transforms the dock from mere location to living archive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure escalates from solitary rope-reading through bureaucratic confrontation to the decisive planting act. The harbormaster's advance forces immediate choice, though his pursuit lacks visceral threat—he's more thematic obstacle than active antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: rope-as-text, seed-as-heritage, planting-as-resistance. The story resists moralizing, letting the final image of shoots threading salt-soaked wood embody the persistence of folk knowledge without declaring it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical density with phrases like "time accordion—past and possible pressed so tightly they hummed." POV control wavers slightly when accessing the harbormaster's thoughts ("called folk memory 'data rot'"), but the perceptual signature remains distinct throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose density occasionally tips into overwriting—"infinitely patient" appears twice, some metaphors strain ("tide-scribes who encoded planting calendars"). However, the rhythm varies naturally and key images like "brittle rosary of sky-fire" earn their complexity through specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of maritime tradition, seed-keeping, and rope-as-text creates fresh specificity. While "tradition versus modernity" is familiar ground, the particular fusion of lightning-fused glass preserving both fire and knowledge, and seeds that "drink salt," transforms the expected.</comment>
