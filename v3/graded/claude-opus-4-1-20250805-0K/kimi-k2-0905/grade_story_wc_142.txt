<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina's dual allegiance creates genuine internal contradiction that drives choices, particularly in the graffiti scene where she must decide between survival unchanged versus survival at any cost. The foundation stone chip serves as embodied emotional anchor throughout. Minor deduction for some label-speak ("culture shock absorber") and the supporting cast remaining somewhat functional rather than fully realized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught resistance culminating in overnight reorganization that reweights the carnival's meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost in "we are still becoming." Deduction for slightly abstract framing of privatization threat early on and the cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The raft city's precarious architecture ("lashed together from pontoons, freight pallets") constrains every choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("popcorn smoke," "gold-toothed pipes"). The overnight reorganization transforms setting into active resistance tool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (carnival's survival) escalates from negotiators measuring decks through graffiti resistance to overnight reorganization, with meaningful deepening when they transform the space. Cost is legible in postponement rather than victory. Minor deduction for the Syndicate's retreat feeling slightly convenient despite the earned transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the foundation stone chip's dual meaning (lifted/dropped), games rigged by uncertainty, poems as prizes. Final line "unreadable to anyone who needed to own what they loved" offers resonant non-literal answer. Slight deduction for "culture shock absorber" edging toward thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout ("counting breaths in fours while letting eyes snag on colors that felt wrong"). Voice maintains lyrical compression without sacrificing clarity. Minor dialogue appears natural and subtextual. Slight deduction for occasional elevated diction ("perpetual carnival drifted") that briefly exceeds Lina's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("strings of bulbs flickered on to keep the dark from remembering land prices"). Some figurative density in opening that borders on overwriting but serves accumulative design. Minor template cadence in "She knew... Still..." construction near end.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gentrification resistance through carnival-as-city metaphor with specific details (calliope as meeting signal, graffiti encoding). The overnight transformation as choreographed resistance is inventive. Risk-taking in lyrical compression and the "unreadable" ending heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
