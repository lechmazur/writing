<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal conflict between preserving and releasing memory drives a meaningful renunciation with visible cost ("its absence weighs more than its presence ever did"). The protagonist's contradictory impulses—holding the fragment for twenty years versus knowing it must be returned—act simultaneously in the painting scene, earning the final choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis: the narrator renounces possession of the fragment, accepting absence as the true anchor. The cost is legible in "The exchange feels like exhaling a life" and the paradox that "absence weighs more than presence." The magical realist lens holds consistently through memory-as-physical-space logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The swaying market above rooftops creates genuine spatial constraint—catwalks become cliffs through painting-portals. The lighthouse fragment's warmth "though it has not guided ships for a hundred years" charges the final image of children chasing the new lighthouse beam. Spatial choreography occasionally blurs but recovers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through the painting's revelation that boy-self and adult-self share the same moment, forcing the choice to return what was taken. The cost manifests in "exhaling a life" and the permanent absence that paradoxically anchors more deeply. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ending reweights the entire premise through "We keep the light by letting it go"—a non-literal answer that transforms possession into release. The theme emerges from concrete action (handing the fragment to boy-self) rather than assertion, with the new lighthouse beam refracted through "absent glass" crystallizing the paradox.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "rope bridges humming with the weight of memory" and "pigment-warm dusk." Voice maintains lyric control through high pressure without losing clarity. Minor register drift in "anchors of intuition" and occasional abstract phrasing ("eternal instant shivers, satisfied") prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("vendors hawk bottled starlight and powdered regret"). Some template cadence in middle sections ("I walk...I step...I kneel") and abstract phrasing ("anchors of intuition settle deeper") create minor drag. The paraphrase loop of light/letting go in final paragraphs dulls momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse keeper heritage, time-travel through paintings, and memory-as-marketplace feels fresh and earned. The specific detail of "a gull frozen mid-cry...signed with the painter's heartbeat" elevates beyond template magical realism. Risk-taking with the paradox of absence-as-anchor pays off (+0.3).</comment>
