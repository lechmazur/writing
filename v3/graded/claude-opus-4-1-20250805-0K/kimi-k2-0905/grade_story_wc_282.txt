<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aera's motivation to preserve emotional echoes before extinction drives coherent choices, with the fossil transformation creating genuine cost (her physical collapse). However, interiority relies on abstract concepts ("factually mystical," "transitional objects") rather than embodied contradiction, and the final dissolution into rumor feels unearned by prior characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the fossil discovery triggering transformation and creating Resonant Reconfiguration—Aera becomes a living voice for the dead. The cost lands clearly (her dissolution into rumor), but the mechanism of transformation feels convenient rather than earned through prior causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cave's emotion-heat mapping creates vivid, constraint-driven setting ("walls glowed ochre and violet"), and the fossil's floating defiance of physics becomes essential to the transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with the environment actively shaping Aera's choices through thermal glyphs and salt-curtains.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving emotional memory) escalates when the fossil inverts the cave's heat-map and demands voice, forcing Aera's transformation. However, the resolution arrives through mystical convenience rather than earned pressure, and the cost (dissolution into rumor) occurs off-page in summary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of voice-as-preservation emerges organically through the fossil's role as "bridge between silences," with the final image of the floating staff proving "the unknown once found a voice." The concept of transitional objects gains specificity through dramatized transformation rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric elevation with controlled syntax ("her boots never quite touching the wet stone"), though some passages drift into academic register ("transitional objects...are bridges between what is felt and what is named"). The perceptual signature stays distinct with Aera's synesthetic heat-reading creating a unique focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("sound poured out—not words but weather"), but abstract terminology clusters in peak beats ("factually mystical," "transitional objects," "sonic layers"). Some passages loop conceptually without advancing pressure, particularly the mentor's definition that gets restated rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The conceit of emotion-heat mapping as archaeological practice after human extinction offers genuine freshness, and the fossil as living memory-seed transforms expected tropes. The synthesis of mystical and scientific ("factually mystical") creates an original register, though execution sometimes favors abstraction over embodiment.</comment>
