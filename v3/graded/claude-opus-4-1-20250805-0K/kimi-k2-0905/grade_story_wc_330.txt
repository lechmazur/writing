<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The carpenter's motivation unfolds through embodied details like "the memory of gears and the quiet persistence" and his throat aching "with a lifetime of swallowed words," creating genuine interiority. His choice to sing through memory rather than voice demonstrates meaningful change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("interpreting silence as possibility") that occasionally distances from immediate embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when the carpenter gains the "whispering gleam" as internal promise and walks forward "carving no wood, yet every footfall left a carousel note," showing transformation with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through pattern-building toward this reconfiguration. Slight deduction for the orientation arriving late (circus location clarified gradually) though this serves the dreamlike atmosphere.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train functions as active setting—the "warped corridor where reflections aged backward" constrains movement, the overturned car with "ceiling torn open" creates the oasis space, and rainwater pool enables the fragment's discovery. Vivid sensory work throughout: "sawdust still faintly glittering with gold paint," "green notes on a staff of starlight." The setting directly shapes the carpenter's journey and charges the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding meaning in silence—deepens through the carpenter's journey from searching for the fragment to discovering "melodies already nested in silence." The transformation from physical search to metaphysical understanding provides meaningful escalation. However, the lack of external opposition or complicating pressure keeps this from higher bands; the journey proceeds without significant resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of silence/sound, stillness/movement, absence/presence without explicit statement. The final image of footfalls leaving "carousel notes spinning in the dirt" resonantly answers the central question about finding voice in silence. The recurring carousel horses and their "wooden harmony" create layered meaning about animation and stasis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "carriages curved like the ribs of some forgotten beast," "misting hush," consistent metaphorical register. The perceptual signature remains specific to the carpenter's craft-consciousness throughout. Excellent rhythmic control maintains dreamlike pace without becoming sluggish, and the sustained poetic register never breaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs—"the carousel horses remembered him; their wooden nostrils flared" simultaneously establishes magical realism, character history, and emotional resonance. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("interpreting silence as possibility") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of circus imagery with metaphysical searching creates fresh territory—particularly the "halo fragment" as fallen grace in a deteriorating performance space. The specific detail of the carpenter who "spent decades oiling horses that never truly galloped" grounds the fantastical in melancholy craft-knowledge. Risk-taking with the lyrical, non-linear structure heightens meaning (+0.3 within band).</comment>
