<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's transformation from scientific controller to surrendering participant is earned through concrete embodied details (silver veins syncing with pulse, skin splitting along old scars). The internal contradiction between her need for control and the plants' mysterious communication drives authentic tension. Minor deduction for the assistant character appearing late without sufficient development to earn her thematic weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation) with visible cost - Mira loses human form but gains understanding that "knowledge wasn't mastery—it was relationship." The accumulative/textural lens holds as storm imagery, silver veins, and transformation details build density toward the crystallized ending. Orientation anchors establish nursery/greenhouse setting immediately.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse environment actively constrains and enables the transformation - mossy trellis catches her fall, sprinkler system triggers ironic recognition, glass roof frames the storm's patterns. Sensory details (water pooling in wood crevices, lightning spider-webbing) are selective and purposeful. The linden leaves' silver veins become both setting detail and transformation catalyst.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (control versus surrender to nature) escalates from observation of strange plant behavior through physical transformation to final acceptance. The storm provides external pressure while Mira's scientific worldview creates internal resistance. Cost is visceral - "brutal honesty of a plant forced to grow around a fence post" - though the assistant's easy acceptance slightly undercuts the established difficulty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the linden leaves' impossible behavior challenges scientific certainty, leading to the realization that "relationships required surrender." The recurring silver veins accumulate meaning from mystery to communication medium to transformation map. Final image of visitors leaving with "dirt beneath their fingernails" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature tracks Mira's scientific precision ("cataloging growth patterns and nutrient cycles") shifting to embodied plant consciousness ("heartbeat slowed to the pace of sap"). Some filter verb accumulation ("felt," "watched," "noticed") slightly dulls immediacy in middle passages. Voice maintains coherence through transformation with effective modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong moments like "laughter died as she realized" and "consciousness scatter like spores" show control. However, template cadence appears ("She pressed...She stumbled...She released") and some paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("studying plant behaviors had always been her way of seeking control" restates earlier shown material). Figurative language occasionally strains ("circuitously sincere in its adaptation").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of plants communicating through storm patterns offers a fresh angle on transformation narrative. The specific detail of silver veins pulsing with thunder and the irony of the automatic sprinkler system elevate beyond template. Risk-taking in the complete physical transformation and meta-ending with the nursery as ongoing site of transformation adds originality.</comment>
