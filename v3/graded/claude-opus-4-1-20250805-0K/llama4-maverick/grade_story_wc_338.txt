<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover secrets reads clear but generic—she's methodically curious but lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle during her discovery. The story tells us about her reverence and peace but doesn't show contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her final gratitude and wonder arrive without earned causality from specific struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story lacks a decisive change or meaningful cost—Elara discovers "secrets" and feels peaceful, but we never learn what she found or how it altered her options. The orientation is clear but the closure merely asserts transformation ("she had finally found a piece of herself") without dramatizing what changed. No visible price is paid for her discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault and ancient henge create atmosphere, but the setting doesn't constrain choices or enable specific tactics. Sensory details like "damp earth and mold" are generic rather than POV-filtered. The henge functions more as backdrop than active environment shaping Elara's decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the henge's secrets—never faces concrete opposition or generates cost. Elara simply analyzes footage and discovers unspecified "patterns" without struggle, reversal, or trade-off. The whispered chapel creates atmosphere but doesn't complicate her task or force difficult choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges weakly through abstract assertions about "mysteries hidden in plain sight" and "listening to silence" but lacks concrete dramatization. The story tells us Elara interprets "silence with empathy" without showing how this manifests in specific choices. The ending's claim about finding "a piece of herself" reads as unearned epiphany.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction—Elara's perceptual signature as a map framer doesn't shape how she notices details. Prose relies on telling ("she felt an eerie stillness") over embodied perception. No dialogue to evaluate, and the narrative distance remains safely omniscient without character-specific texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose flows competently but suffers from abstract telling and repetitive structure. Phrases like "she felt" appear 8 times, creating filter-verb accumulation. Lines like "mysteries that lay just beyond the edge of the known" and "secrets waiting to be uncovered" paraphrase the same concept. The writing lacks information density, with many sentences doing single duty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise of analyzing decades-apart footage to decode an ancient henge offers mild freshness, but execution remains generic. The story doesn't transform its archaeological mystery trope through specific detail—the "whispered chapel" and discovered patterns could belong to any mystical site story. Elara's insights arrive through assertion rather than earned particulars.</comment>
