I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivation (debt repayment) drives consistent action, but both characters lack embodied interiority and concrete impulses. The alchemist remains passive, merely receiving guidance rather than wrestling with contradictory desires. "Lovingly venomous intent" is stated but never dramatized through specific choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the resonant awakening serving as closure, but the transformation lacks visible cost—the alchemist gains power without sacrifice. The ghost bride's "debt slowly being repaid" happens automatically without earned causality. Who/where/when anchors are established, but the closure reads as unearned gift rather than costly choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting with luminescent orbs and specific sensory details (sandalwood, myrrh) creates atmosphere, and the carved stone bead functions as a tool constraining the awakening. However, the setting rarely pressures choices—it's more backdrop than crucible. "Winter-cracked fields" appears only as description without affecting action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (unlocking resonant awakenings) is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or cost. The alchemist reaches for the bead and succeeds without struggle, trade-off, or price. The ghost bride's guidance creates no friction. Escalation is absent—the awakening simply happens when touched.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The debt/repayment theme emerges through the ghost bride's actions and creates some resonance with transformation and legacy. However, "mournful elation" and the bittersweet dynamic remain abstract labels rather than dramatized complexity. The ending attempts thematic weight but lacks the specific experience that would earn it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV focused on the alchemist, with controlled psychic distance and no head-hopping. However, the voice lacks distinctiveness—it could belong to any character. Perceptual signature is minimal; the alchemist notices everything equally without selective attention reflecting her expertise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "resonant awakenings" appears 7 times, "ghost bride" 14 times, "carved stone bead" 5 times. Template cadence runs throughout ("The alchemist felt...," "As she..."). Paraphrase loops abound: lines 19-21 restate the same transformation three ways. These artifacts touch the closure, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ghost bride guide concept offers mild freshness, but execution relies on familiar mystical greenhouse and alchemical transformation tropes without transformation. The "debt across lifetimes" and magical awakening follow well-worn fantasy patterns. No risk-taking or unexpected synthesis elevates beyond competent genre work.</comment>
