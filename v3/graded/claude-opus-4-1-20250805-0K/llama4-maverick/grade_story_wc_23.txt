<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The navigator's motivation is clear (reclaiming lost geography after disaster) and her internal state shows concrete embodiment through the censer foot handling and moon-phase sensitivity. However, the character remains largely alone without relationship crucible, and the emotional progression from loss to acceptance feels summarized rather than earned through dramatized struggle—the journey happens in exposition rather than scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the navigator accepts loss and faces a new horizon, with cost visible in the "fragments of the old." However, the accumulative structure relies heavily on summary rather than dramatized beats—the actual journey, the cryptic calls, and the reverse migration all occur in exposition rather than scene, weakening causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The starlit signal station and devastated industrial landscape are vividly anchored, with sensory details like "canvas of shadows and light" and the "patina bronze censer foot" providing texture. The moon phases constrain the navigator's abilities meaningfully, though most environmental interaction happens in summary rather than lived-in scene moments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (navigating grief/reclaiming the past) is signaled early but escalation happens entirely in summary—"The journey was long and arduous" rather than showing specific obstacles or choices. The moon phases create some pressure variation, but no dramatized reversals or concrete costs appear until the final acceptance, which arrives without earned struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of rebuilding from fragments emerges through the patchwork navigator metaphor and culminates in "build a new life on the fragments of the old." However, the theme develops through exposition and assertion ("raw solace," "geography of loss") rather than dramatized particulars, though the censer foot provides some concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistency with phrases like "patchwork of salvaged parts" reflecting the protagonist's fragmented state, and perceptual details align with her navigator role. However, the prose relies heavily on telling and exposition, with no dialogue to test voice distinction, and filter-heavy constructions ("she felt," "she knew") dominate rather than immediate perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The prose suffers from repetitive structures ("The navigator..." opens multiple paragraphs) and exposition-heavy telling that summarizes rather than dramatizes key beats. Lines like "slowly but surely" and "long and arduous" are generic placeholders, though some specific images ("patina bronze censer foot") provide texture. The final paragraph achieves better rhythm but can't overcome the accumulated drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The concept of a "patchwork navigator" whose abilities fluctuate with moon phases offers a fresh angle, and the reverse migration through devastated geography has potential. However, execution remains generic with stock phrases ("open wound," "beacon of hope") and the cryptic phone calls feel like borrowed mystery rather than organic to this world.</comment>
