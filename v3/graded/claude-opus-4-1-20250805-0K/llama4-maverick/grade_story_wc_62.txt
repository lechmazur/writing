<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The carver's internal journey from turmoil to peace is tracked through concrete embodiment (chiseling, closing eyes, sitting in silence), but the "fiercely meditative" attribute reads as label-only without visible cost or contradiction in scene. The spectral mentor appears without earning its emotional weight through prior causality, though the final acceptance of grief's shape carries genuine cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through butterflies, ribbon, and poem accumulating toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the carver discovers "the shape of collective grief." However, the cost remains largely conceptual rather than felt on the page—we're told she finds peace but don't see what specific path is foreclosed or what price she pays for this understanding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting with its "misty veil" and tropical plants creates atmosphere, and the butterflies constrain the temporal window meaningfully. The gravestones and ribbon serve as tactile anchors throughout, though the space never fully pressures choices beyond providing a meditative backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of understanding collective grief is signaled early but remains abstract throughout—the carver moves from turmoil to peace without facing concrete opposition or making costly choices. The butterfly migration provides temporal pressure but doesn't force trade-offs or narrow options in ways that test the protagonist's commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The butterfly migration as metaphor for life/death cycles and the ribbon tradition connect to collective grief thematically, emerging through particulars rather than statement. However, the final insight about grief being "both beautiful and terrible" tends toward the generic without the specific cost or complexity that would elevate the thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent meditative register but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—the carver notices things in fairly standard ways ("sweet scent," "delicate dance"). Phrases like "thundering calm" and "calm as a summer storm" create intentional paradox but the overall voice remains safely literary without risk or memorable texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "feeling a sense of peace settle over her" appears twice with minor variation; "the shape of collective grief" repeats three times without evolution. The prose tends toward abstract summary ("turmoil within," "weight of her grief") rather than concrete image, and filter constructions ("she felt," "she realized") distance key moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The gravestone carver finding solace through spectral mentorship and butterfly migration follows familiar grief-processing templates without transformation through specific lived detail. The core concept of discovering grief's "shape" remains abstract rather than grounded in this particular character's world and choices.</comment>
