I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered encounters and spectral confessions, with density increasing toward closure through the woman's story and the collector's response.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The collector maintains consistent traits as a guide for lost souls, but her interiority remains generic ("modestly fearless," "sense of satisfaction"). The spectral woman's confession about the crocodile's tooth provides specificity, yet the collector's own motivations lack embodied complexity - she processes experiences through abstract labels rather than visceral response.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the woman's spirit dissipates after confession, but the cost remains abstract ("luminous ache"). The accumulative structure works - whispers build to confession to release - yet the closure lacks visible price; we see completion but not transformation or genuine loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Echo Gorge functions well as an atmospheric container with mist, waterfall, and "whispers of the restless dead." The misaligned harp's distorted notes create effective sensory pressure. However, the setting doesn't constrain choices - the collector moves freely without environmental obstacles shaping her tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stakes remain steady rather than escalating - the collector guides a soul as she has "countless" times before. The woman's spectral confession about the crocodile's tooth adds texture but doesn't fundamentally challenge or transform the collector's approach. No meaningful tightening occurs; this reads as routine work rather than crisis.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "luminous ache" and integration of "laughter into healing" appear as stated themes rather than emergent properties. The crocodile's tooth carries potential symbolic weight but functions mainly as narrative detail. The ending's assertion about "redemption" and "healing" lacks earned resonance through dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. The voice maintains atmospheric control ("hush of a hidden sunrise," "mist swirled around her ankles") but lacks distinctive perceptual signature. Prose competently conveys the ethereal setting without achieving memorable texture or rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Significant repetition issues: "modestly fearless" appears twice, "distorted notes" three times, "luminous ache" twice. Template phrasing pervades ("She approached cautiously," "She followed the sound," "She turned to pursue"). The final third especially suffers from abstract assertion ("beacon of hope in the darkness") rather than concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The soul collector concept offers inherent interest, and the spectral confession framework provides structure. However, execution remains conventional - the collector performs expected actions without surprise or transformation. The crocodile's tooth detail adds specificity but doesn't fundamentally alter the familiar ghost-guide template.</comment>
