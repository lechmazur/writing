I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered descriptions and pattern accumulation toward a transcendent final image rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to "capture one last spark before oblivion" remains abstract throughout, never embodied in concrete choices or contradictory impulses. The "beautician mortician" profession is mentioned but doesn't inform her specific skills or worldview. Her internal state consists of telling ("turmoil within," "overwhelming longing") rather than embodied emotion under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through Aria's spirit "taking flight," but this transformation lacks visible cost on the page - she simply completes her task and transcends without sacrifice or renunciation. The accumulative lens holds but the piece never establishes what Aria risks or loses. The "threshold of stillness" concept floats without concrete stakes or consequences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora create vivid atmospheric texture through "crystalline structures refracting" light and specific color work. The emerald chip gains physical presence through Aria's handling. However, the setting never constrains choices - the grotto's properties remain decorative rather than forcing tactical decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation occurs - Aria works on the emerald, infuses it with aurora essence, then transcends, all without opposition or rising cost. The "threshold of stillness" is declared as approaching but never manifests as concrete pressure. The resolution arrives through completion of a task that faced no obstacles.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of beauty persisting beyond death emerges through the aurora-infused emerald as "beacon of hope and transcendence." However, the piece relies heavily on abstract declarations ("mystery that lay at the heart of all things") rather than earned resonance. The final image of the grotto's "quiet, lucid awareness" offers some thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the lyrical mode, with controlled rhythm in passages like "the world contracting to a single, shining point." However, the voice lacks distinctive perceptual signature - Aria notices everything with equal, generic attention rather than through the specific lens of a beautician mortician.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Severe repetition issues throughout: "Aria's hands," "Aria's mind," "Aria's fingers," "Aria felt" create template cadence. Paraphrase loops abound: "profound silence"/"stillness"/"quiet" cycle without progression. Abstract telling dominates ("sense of wonder," "sense of awe," "deep sense of connection") where concrete imagery should anchor emotion. The phrase "threshold of stillness" appears five times without evolving meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "beautician mortician" working on gems in a floating grotto offers unusual juxtaposition. The method of "finding patterns in static" from mortuary equipment shows originality. However, execution remains generic - the transcendence narrative follows predictable beats without surprising turns or specific lived detail that would elevate the concept.</comment>
