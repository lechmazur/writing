<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Luna's motivation to "reawaken beauty" remains abstract without concrete embodied emotion or internal contradiction. The statues' transformation occurs through external magic rather than earned character choices with visible cost. Characters lack distinct voices or knowledge states - all perceive the orchard's beauty identically once freed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a true closure with cost - the statues simply awaken and celebrate without any price paid or path foreclosed. The transformation happens TO them rather than through agency. No persistent constraint shapes tactics or the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard setting provides vivid sensory detail ("flowers that shimmered like stardust") but doesn't constrain choices or enable specific tactics. The sky-bridge remains ornamental, merely "shimmering with ethereal light" without affecting the outcome. Spatial choreography stays vague - we never know where Luna stands relative to the statues.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of "reawakening beauty in a mechanical world" never faces concrete opposition or test. Luna plays music, statues awaken, world transforms - no escalation, no narrowing of options, no trade-off required. The "mechanical world's grip" is declared but never dramatized as actual pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through repetitive abstract statements about beauty and mechanical coldness rather than concrete particulars. The locust shell symbolizes "fragile beauty" but never constrains choice or accumulates meaning beyond its initial declaration. The ending celebrates renewal without exploring complexity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent fairy-tale register but lacks a distinct perceptual signature - Luna notices everything with equal poetic abstraction. No dialogue appears to test naturalism. Phrases like "resonantly soft touch" and "tarnished wonder" feel forced rather than organic to the POV's lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Pervasive template cadence ("Luna's music was...", "The statues, now...", "As she...") and paraphrase loops weaken momentum. Abstract descriptors like "vibrating with renewed vitality" and "exuberant and tender" replace concrete imagery. The phrase "resonantly soft" appears three times without variation, suggesting synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The enchanted musician awakening stone guardians follows a familiar template without transformation through specific detail. The "mechanical world versus natural beauty" dichotomy presents no fresh angle. Risk-averse execution chooses the safest resolution where everyone awakens to identical appreciation.</comment>
