<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aria's motivation as a "contact tracer for hearts" feels conceptually thin—she tracks and reassures but shows no internal conflict or personal stake in this encounter. The woman's grief is genuine but one-note, lacking the contradictory impulses that would elevate characterization. The hearing aid device provides external motivation but Aria herself remains a functional vessel rather than a complex character facing cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the sister's reunion/closure moment, but the cost remains abstract—"peace settling" without visible price. The causal chain is weak: Aria follows pulses → finds woman → provides comfort → woman achieves closure, with no meaningful complication or earned transformation. The mystical premise ("when the dead call") is declared but never tested against resistance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium creates atmosphere and the hearing aid functions as a concrete anchor, but neither constrains choices or enables specific tactics. Setting details like "mist swirling around Aria like a shroud" remain decorative rather than pressuring action. The atrium's "tragic past" is mentioned but never dramatized to affect present choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconnecting the grieving woman with her sister's memory—faces no opposition or complication. Aria simply approaches, takes the woman's hand, and delivers reassurance without obstacle. No escalation occurs; the mist clearing reads as convenient resolution rather than earned through struggle. The "cost" is the woman's tears, but these precede rather than result from the choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of keeping memories alive emerges through the central action but remains surface-level without complexity. "Incidental heroism" appears as a label rather than earned through specific struggle. The story's resolution—that loved ones live on in memory—offers no fresh angle or earned wisdom, defaulting to consolation without examining the price of holding onto the dead.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited but lacks distinct texture—Aria's perceptual signature never emerges beyond functional observation. Dialogue ("I've been searching for my sister") is serviceable but carries no subtext. Filter-heavy constructions like "Aria felt," "Aria realized," "Aria knew" accumulate without voice-motivated purpose, creating distance rather than immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Pervasive template cadence ("Aria stood," "Aria approached," "Aria felt," "Aria smiled") creates mechanical rhythm. Abstract descriptors like "otherworldly silence," "mystical realm," and "incidental heroism" replace concrete detail. Paraphrase loops appear throughout: "tears streaming"/"tears flowed harder," "mist swirling"/"mist closing in," "gentle hum"/"gentle hush." The filter-verb stack in peak moments ("Aria felt," "Aria realized," "Aria began") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "contact tracer for hearts using a dead girl's hearing aid" premise offers conceptual freshness but execution defaults to generic consolation narrative. The supernatural element (tracking the dead) could distinguish the piece but resolves into standard grief counseling without transformation. No risk-taking in structure or perspective; the story follows the safest emotional path.</comment>
