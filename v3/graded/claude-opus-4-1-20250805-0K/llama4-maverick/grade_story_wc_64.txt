<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The gardener's motivation feels abstract rather than embodied—"discover the shape of intentions" never translates to concrete stakes or visceral need. The character works methodically but lacks internal contradiction or genuine struggle; their dedication reads as stated rather than earned through specific pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver meaningful closure with cost. The gardener's "newfound understanding" and "sense of purpose" arrive without transformation or sacrifice—they simply continue tending graves with "greater tenderness." No path is foreclosed, no price paid; the ending merely restates the opening with elevated language.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and cemetery create atmosphere, but setting rarely constrains choice or enables tactics. The tapestry and crystal exist as plot devices rather than lived-in objects with specific textures. The "velveteen gloom" and starlight provide mood without affecting the gardener's actions or options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract throughout—"uncharted echoes" and "shape of intentions" never manifest as concrete pressure. The gardener faces no opposition or meaningful choice; they simply work on the tapestry until understanding arrives. No escalation occurs under the Accumulative lens; density doesn't increase toward closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges only through abstract statements about "intentions that lay beyond" and "echoes" without concrete dramatization. The tapestry's "hidden message" and "long-forgotten language" arrive as assertions rather than earned discoveries. The ending's claim that "the world, once mundane, was now alive" lacks specific imagery to make this transformation felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction—the prose could belong to any contemplative character. Filter-heavy constructions ("the gardener began to discern," "the gardener's understanding grew") distance us from immediate experience. No dialogue to evaluate, and the perceptual signature remains generic despite the unusual setting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose suffers from abstraction and repetitive phrasing—"uncharted echoes" appears five times without variation. Template constructions proliferate: "The gardener's [noun] [verb]" opens multiple sentences. Key moments rely on telling ("excitement and trepidation," "newfound understanding") rather than concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise of a cemetery gardener discovering cosmic echoes through a tapestry offers potential but executes through generic mysticism. The "antique sovereign case" and crystal feel borrowed from fantasy templates without transformation. The story's resolution—understanding leads to continued grave-tending—takes the safest possible path.</comment>
