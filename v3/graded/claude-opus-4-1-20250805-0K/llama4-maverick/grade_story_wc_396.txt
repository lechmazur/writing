<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The peacekeeper's motivation to "map empathy onto action" provides consistent internal logic, and her calmly intuitive nature enables the crystal reconstitution. However, the character lacks internal contradiction or embodied struggle during the key reconstitution sequence—she moves through the task with meditative ease rather than facing genuine difficulty that would elevate stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the crystal reconstitution serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration that "maps empathy onto the shifting landscapes of the heart." The closure lands with conceptual cost ("the burden of her role as guardian"), but the cost remains abstract rather than viscerally felt through specific loss or trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above ice floes creates a vivid, specific setting that constrains the peacekeeper's isolation and frames her guardian role. The vintage mirrors function as essential tools that enable the crystal reconstitution, making the environment integral to the story's resolution rather than decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>While the story establishes the peacekeeper's guardian role and the need to reconstitute the crystal, escalation remains flat—she encounters no resistance or complication during the reconstitution process. The "weighted breath before reply" creates atmospheric tension but doesn't translate into concrete obstacles that would force difficult choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of mapping empathy onto action emerges through the crystal reconstitution process and the peacekeeper's role as balance-keeper. The final image of the landscape sighing "a soft exhalation" resonates with the established pattern, though the story occasionally veers toward explicit statement ("mapping of empathy onto the shifting landscapes of the heart").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with phrases like "shadow-laced" and "weighted breath," creating a dreamlike atmosphere appropriate to the story's meditative pace. However, the voice lacks distinctive perceptual signature—the peacekeeper notices things poetically but not in ways that reveal unique character perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "weighted breath before reply" appears three times; "calmly intuitive nature" and similar constructions repeat; "reconstitute the crystal" cycles through variations. The prose achieves moments of beauty ("ice floes below seemed to slow their restless motion") but sacrifices propulsion for atmospheric repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The concept of using vintage mirrors to reconstitute a broken crystal ball offers a fresh angle on restoration/healing narratives. The specific combination of lighthouse orchard, ice floes, and mirror-mediated reconstruction creates an original synthesis, though the execution leans heavily on familiar fantasy tropes without fully transforming them.</comment>
