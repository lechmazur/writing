I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This piece operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens - the narrative builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than causal linkage, with the porcelain shard's final release serving as a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Akira's motivation as a "death certificate error survivor" seeking understanding feels conceptually intriguing but lacks embodied specificity - her internal state reads more as abstract yearning than lived experience. The "heartbeats counting" trait appears but never constrains choices or creates visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The closure moment (releasing the porcelain shard) attempts resonant reconfiguration but lacks visible cost - Akira gains understanding without sacrifice or foreclosed options. The accumulative structure coheres but the transformation from seeking to finding feels unearned without intermediate pressure that changes her tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The opal observatory and snow create atmospheric coherence, and the porcelain shard functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. However, the setting doesn't constrain choices - Akira could perform these same actions anywhere with minor adjustments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract throughout - "uncovering secrets" and "fetching wisdom from failure" never face concrete tests or opposition. No meaningful tightening occurs; Akira's journey proceeds without obstacles, reversals, or moments where she must choose between competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of finding solace through understanding emerges through accumulated imagery, but resolves into comfort without complexity. The final paragraph's explicit statements ("she had found a measure of solace") replace earned resonance with direct assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture - phrases like "sense of midnight solace" and "eerie beauty" feel generic rather than filtered through Akira's specific perceptual signature. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prose suffers from abstract descriptors ("otherworldly light," "inexplicable urge") and repetitive constructions ("Akira felt," "Akira knew"). The paraphrase loop between "midnight solace" appearing three times without evolution triggers deduction, and elevated diction ("ephemeral patterns") clashes with minimal concrete detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The concept of a death certificate error survivor investigating digital ghosts offers surface novelty but executes through familiar mystical-discovery templates. The story doesn't transform its premise through specific lived detail - swap the digital ghost for any supernatural element and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>
