<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dealer's character shows consistent professional detachment and methodical craft, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her "affectionate detachment" is stated rather than embodied through conflicting micro-choices. The final departure shows no visible cost or genuine struggle between competing desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>No closure occurs on the page - the dealer simply completes her work and leaves. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver any decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with cost. The ending merely restates the opening situation without transformation or narrowed options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The amber grotto's luminescent stones create vivid atmosphere and the fragrance chemist's petal provides sensory specificity. However, the setting never constrains choices or charges the final image - it remains decorative backdrop. The grotto's "whisper of approval" attempts resonance but lacks earned weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs - the dealer crafts emotions exactly as planned without opposition or complication. Stakes remain abstract ("half truths" of emotion) without testing or cost. The work proceeds smoothly from intention to completion with no pressure forcing adaptation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The concept of crafting "half truths" of emotion has thematic potential but never develops through concrete dramatization. The story tells us about nuanced emotional subtleties without showing specific emotions being crafted or their effects. The ending offers no resonant answer to what these half-truths mean or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature - descriptions could belong to any observer. Repetitive phrasing ("the dealer," "luminescent stones," "amber grotto") creates monotony. No dialogue appears to test character voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Severe repetition problems: "luminescent stones" (5x), "amber grotto" (7x), "the dealer" opens most paragraphs. Template cadence runs throughout ("As she..., the dealer..."). Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same information about crafting emotions without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise of an emotion dealer crafting "half truths" offers conceptual freshness, but execution remains generic without specific emotional examples or unique transformation. The story doesn't commit to exploring its implications - we never see what these counterfeit emotions actually do or cost anyone.</comment>
