<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The novelist's internal conflict about creative paralysis is established but remains abstract without embodied contradiction or specific micro-choices under pressure. The woman in white functions more as external validation than genuine internal wrestling. The final "peace" and flow restoration lacks earned causality from prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story attempts Accumulative/Textural progression but the closure (writer's block resolved, words flowing again) arrives through mystical intervention rather than earned transformation. The woman's appearances don't create genuine cost or force difficult choices. No visible price is paid for the breakthrough - the "turmoil" simply dissipates without concrete sacrifice or foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "feral nexus" and mist create atmospheric texture but don't constrain choices or enable specific tactics. The spiral shell fragment receives repeated attention yet never moves beyond symbolic ornament to affect action. Setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure source.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The central stake (overcoming writer's block) is declared but faces no concrete test or escalation. The woman's appearances don't tighten options or force trade-offs - they simply encourage. No meaningful reversal or deepening occurs; the resolution arrives without the protagonist paying any price or making a hard choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The theme of creative struggle emerges through repetition but resolves into simple validation without complexity. The spiral shell's symbolism is stated rather than earned through action. The ending's "shapes of different hopes" arrives as abstract assertion rather than dramatized insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature - the novelist could be any writer in any misty place. Heavy reliance on abstract emotional states ("conflicted," "turmoil," "peace") without specific embodiment. The narrative voice defaults to writerly meditation without character-specific texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Pervasive abstraction and paraphrase loops weaken line-level momentum: "she felt a sense of calm wash over her" followed immediately by redundant emotional labeling. Template phrasing pervades ("she felt," "she knew," "she realized" appears 15+ times). The final third especially suffers from synonym churn around writing/words/story without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The writer-confronts-block premise is extensively familiar without transformation through specific detail. The mystical woman in white who validates the artist reads as wish-fulfillment rather than earned complexity. No risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis elevates the material beyond workshop template.</comment>
