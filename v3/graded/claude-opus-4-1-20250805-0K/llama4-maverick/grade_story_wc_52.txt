<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The widow's grief is embodied through concrete actions (carving, tea ritual) rather than abstract emotional states, and her internal conflict between containing pain and confronting loss plays out through micro-choices. However, the emotional progression feels overly smooth—grief transforms to "rust-hued peace" without the contradictory impulses or credible irrationality expected in fresh bereavement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the widow working through grief via repetitive ritual, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she finds "a way to honor her loss." However, the cost remains abstract—we see her complete the carving and feel peace, but the specific price paid or path foreclosed isn't legible on the page, violating the cost proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft functions as more than backdrop, creating a sanctuary atmosphere that mirrors the widow's emotional state, with sensory details (rain sounds, wood grain, tea aroma) filtered through her grief-focused perception. The setting subtly guides her ritual of containment through the physical constraints of the small, enclosed space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—processing grief through craft—is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens. The widow moves through her ritual without encountering resistance or deepening pressure; the carving simply "takes shape" without struggle, and her emotional journey proceeds without the density increase or pattern break that would create true escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of containment versus confrontation emerges through the carving process and the "here and gone" meditation, with the final image of "rust-hued peace" offering a non-literal answer about finding ways to live with loss. However, the thematic resolution feels too tidy—the widow achieves peace without visible struggle or ambiguity, and phrases like "harvest lessons from her loss" edge toward explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with appropriate psychic distance, and the perceptual signature (focusing on tactile sensations, the comfort of ritual) fits the widow's state. However, the prose lacks rhythmic variation under emotional pressure—sentences maintain similar length and structure even as she confronts her husband's death, missing opportunities for syntactic mirroring of internal turbulence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "rust-hued peace" appears twice verbatim, the concept of containing emotions is restated in lines 5, 12, and 21, and "here and gone" gets explained rather than dramatized. Template cadence appears in "As she began...As the kettle reached...As the afternoon wore on" creating mechanical progression that undermines organic flow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>While the lion tamer's widow offers specificity, the grief-through-craft narrative follows familiar templates without transformation—the therapeutic creation process resolving to peace is well-worn territory. The piece commits to its quiet, meditative approach but doesn't risk anything bold or offer a non-obvious angle on loss and recovery.</comment>
