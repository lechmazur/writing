<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The investigator's motivation feels generic—"cultivate foresight in action" reads as abstract jargon rather than embodied need. Her internal state remains largely unexplored beyond surface professionalism. The patch connection hints at personal stakes but never develops into genuine internal conflict or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>No closure lands on the page—the investigator simply leaves with vague "determination" and unspecified "next move." The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver any resonant reconfiguration or decisive change. "She was one step closer to understanding the truth" is pure summary without dramatized discovery or cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting provides strong atmosphere and constrains movement effectively. Sensory details like rust, saltwater, and creaking containers ground the space. However, the setting doesn't meaningfully pressure choices or enable specific tactics—it's more backdrop than active participant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No real conflict emerges—the investigator encounters zero opposition, makes no difficult choices, and faces no escalating pressure. The "complex interplay of factors" remains abstract. The story promises investigation of a catastrophic crash but delivers only unopposed surveying without stakes or cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Theme remains abstract—"cultivation of foresight in action" and "complex interplay of factors" are corporate-speak without embodied meaning. The patch gestures toward human cost but never develops. Final paragraph moralizing ("The crash would not be forgotten") replaces earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable but generic—the investigator's perceptual signature lacks distinction. Prose defaults to telling over showing ("her mind racing with the implications"). Filter-heavy construction dulls immediacy: "she noticed," "she realized," "she felt" proliferate without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences: "rapidly adapting" appears three times; "complex interplay" twice; multiple variations of "she was determined/driven." Template cadence dominates: "She [verb]... She [verb]... She [verb]." Abstract corporate diction ("cultivate foresight in action") violates POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—investigator examines crash site—is utterly generic without transformation. No fresh angle emerges through specific detail or unexpected development. The story reads like an AI response to prompts rather than organic vision.</comment>
