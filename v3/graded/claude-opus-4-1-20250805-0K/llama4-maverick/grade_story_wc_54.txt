<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to restore the terminal is stated rather than dramatized through embodied struggle or internal contradiction. The character reads more as a vehicle for atmospheric description than a person facing genuine internal conflict—her "functionally creative streak" exists only as a label without affecting specific choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost—Maya simply fixes pipes and walks away without facing meaningful opposition or paying a price. The restoration happens too easily through unexplained technical competence, and the "maze of intentions" setup never delivers causal pressure or closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal setting creates effective atmosphere through selective detail ("crookedly hung signs," "rusting valves"), though it never constrains Maya's choices or forces trade-offs. The spatial choreography remains coherent as she moves through the space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>No genuine conflict emerges—Maya encounters an abandoned building and repairs it without opposition, setback, or cost. The "maze of intentions" promises complexity but delivers only decorative patterns that don't affect her actions or require sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The theme of "renewal and hope" emerges through explicit statements ("equations for hope") rather than dramatized struggle. The final moralizing about "the power of hope and creativity" replaces earned resonance with direct thesis statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV without head-hopping, and Maya's engineering perspective colors some observations. However, repetitive phrasing ("Maya knew," "Maya felt," "she began to") creates mechanical cadence, and the voice lacks distinctive texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("The terminal, once a symbol of abandonment, was becoming a beacon of possibility" restates what's already shown). Template cadence runs ("As she...," "Maya's...," "The...") and abstract descriptors ("stoic wonder," "newfound sense of purpose") replace concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport setting offers some atmospheric freshness, but the core arc—person discovers abandoned place, fixes it, finds hope—follows a familiar template without transformation. The "maze of intentions" concept promises originality but never develops beyond decorative mention.</comment>
