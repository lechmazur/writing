<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation to compile fragments is clear and consistent, but her internal experience lacks embodied specificity, relying on abstract states like "overwhelming urge" and "sense of pride." The shopkeeper offers minimal pressure as a secondary character. The final choice to create installations shows agency but the emotional progression feels summarized rather than dramatized through micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the archivist gathering fragments to rebuild community memory, but the closure lacks visible cost - the installations succeed without meaningful sacrifice or trade-off. The piece anchors who/where/when adequately. The pattern of collection-to-display coheres but the transformation from exile's end to community healing happens too smoothly without earned friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ivory harbor setting frames the story effectively with sensory details like "musty scent of aged artifacts" and "mist-shrouded alleyways." The harbor's transformation from "weathered stones" to "beacon of hope" provides atmospheric progression. However, the setting rarely constrains choices - the archivist moves through spaces without the environment forcing tactical decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of healing community through remembrance is signaled early but lacks meaningful tightening - the installations succeed without obstacles or reversals. No visible price is paid for the archivist's work beyond vague "tireless efforts." The conflict remains external (community needs healing) without internal friction that would force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of remembrance healing collective trauma emerges through the trumpet valve and installations, avoiding direct moralizing until the final paragraphs slip into summary ("testament to the power of remembrance"). The recurring harbor-as-beacon metaphor provides coherence. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves too neatly without acknowledging what remains lost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains stable distance but lacks a distinct perceptual signature - the archivist notices things generically ("eyes scanning," "gaze fell upon") without character-specific selection bias. Dialogue appears only briefly through the shopkeeper's "Welcome" without revealing subtext. The prose voice reads competent but interchangeable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Pervasive repetition undermines momentum: "archivist" appears 19 times, "harbor" 14 times, creating template cadence. Paraphrase loops abound: "help them heal and rebuild" followed immediately by "heartened the community." The final eight paragraphs spiral through variations of the same "harbor restored/community healed" conclusion without adding pressure or detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ocean-spray archivist collecting maritime fragments offers mild freshness but executes familiar post-disaster healing tropes without transformation. The herald's trumpet valve as memory catalyst feels arbitrary rather than inevitable. The story takes no risks, choosing median emotional beats and a thoroughly safe resolution where community healing happens without genuine struggle.</comment>
