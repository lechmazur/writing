I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through layered imagery (sea glass, cairns, luminescent ache) toward a resonant reconfiguration. The skipper's final acceptance of his role as protector, carrying the "luminescent ache," constitutes an Earned Stasis with visible emotional cost.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The skipper's motivation coheres around protecting the lighthouse's essence, with the "luminescent ache" effectively embodying his internal state. However, his character remains somewhat archetypal—the "reticent" quality is told rather than dramatized through specific behavioral choices. The final acceptance of his protective role shows earned endurance with emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis—the skipper accepts his role as protector with the "luminescent ache spread through his chest" marking emotional cost. The accumulative lens holds as imagery layers (sea glass, cairns, ache) build toward this reconfiguration. Minor orientation wobble with the anonymous letters subplot that doesn't fully integrate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting functions beyond description—the darkened lighthouse creates urgency, the cairn-stacking ritual provides tactile action, and the sea glass becomes a tangible anchor for the skipper's emotional state. The "haunted lantern room" and shore effectively constrain and enable key choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the lighthouse's protective essence—deepens through the skipper's cairn-building and decision to carry the sea glass. However, the anonymous letters subplot dilutes focus without adding meaningful pressure. The emotional cost is felt but could be more sharply dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "luminescent ache" beautifully captures the story's thematic core—the burden and beauty of guardianship. The final image of the skipper sailing into darkness while the lighthouse stands sentinel resonates without stating its meaning. The cairn ritual adds textural depth to the theme of connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture—phrases like "weathered denim jacket" and "soft blue, like the first hint of dawn" feel writerly rather than character-specific. The perceptual signature doesn't fully distinguish this particular skipper's way of seeing. Some overwriting in metaphorical passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose suffers from density issues—figurative language appears too frequently ("luminescent ache" repeated 4 times) and some passages loop conceptually ("sense of safety...feeling of safety"). Template phrases like "pang of recognition" and "sense of resolve form within him" lack specificity. However, key images land cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The cairn-stacking as a wordless communication system offers freshness, as does the concept of the lighthouse containing "a deep and abiding sorrow." However, the reticent keeper archetype and sea-glass-as-memory trope feel familiar. The "luminescent ache" phrase provides some distinction.</comment>
