<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The artist's internal journey through "unlearning" provides consistent motivation, but lacks embodied contradiction in scene - her turmoil is declared rather than shown through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The final peace arrives without visible cost or genuine struggle, just abstract "resolution."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver meaningful closure with cost. The artist "discovers meaning in the mess" through passive observation of her mandala, but no decisive change, renunciation, or reconfiguration occurs on the page - she simply feels peaceful without earning it through action or paying a price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The grotto setting with mist and whispering walls creates atmosphere, but doesn't constrain choices or provide resources that alter the artist's actions. The tile flake functions as a found message rather than environmental pressure that shapes her tactics or final decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation occurs - the artist works on her mandala while internal states are declared ("lilac unease," "emergent hush") without building pressure that narrows options. The pattern completion lacks stakes or cost; she simply adds finishing touches without confronting obstacles or making trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through repetitive abstract phrases ("emergent hush," "lilac unease," "meaning in the mess") that lack concrete dramatization. The ending tells us she "discovered meaning" without showing what specific meaning arose from her experience or how it reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency but relies heavily on abstract descriptors and filter constructions ("she felt," "seemed to be") that distance us from immediate experience. Repetitive phrasing ("lilac unease" appears 4 times, "emergent hush" 3 times) creates monotony rather than purposeful pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Extensive paraphrase loops undermine momentum: "The sand mandala was a reflection of her own inner world, a world that was slowly coming into focus" appears nearly verbatim twice. Template cadence ("She was...", "It was...", "As she...") and abstract labels ("lilac unease," "emergent hush") replace concrete imagery throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The sand mandala meditation offers a familiar framework without transformation through specific detail or unexpected development. The journey from turmoil to peace through artistic creation follows predictable beats without risk or surprise.</comment>
