I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is primarily an Accumulative/Textural piece. The story builds through layered descriptions of Raftoria's carnival atmosphere, Lanara's graffiti campaign, and the community's gradual reorganization. The closure shows accumulated resistance crystallizing into collective action, with the foundation stone chip serving as a recurring motif that gains weight.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lanara's "orderly intuitive" trait manifests through her graffiti encoding system, and her dual allegiance creates genuine tension. However, her internal conflict lacks embodied contradictions in scene—we're told about her torn loyalties but don't see them clash in real-time decisions. The "hopeful desperation" feels more declared than dramatized through specific gestural or perceptual shifts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through community reorganization, but the cost remains abstract—we don't see specific losses or sacrifices made by individuals. The accumulative structure coheres but lacks a decisive moment where Lanara pays a personal price. The corporate envoy's arrival and the crowd's response feel convenient rather than causally earned through the graffiti campaign's specific mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Raftoria's carnival setting pressures choices effectively—the perpetual festival atmosphere contrasts with gentrification threats, and the raft structure enables the graffiti network. Sensory details like "cotton candy scents" and "Ferris wheels spun against sunset" create atmosphere, though they lean generic rather than POV-filtered through Lanara's specific perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The gentrification threat establishes clear stakes, and pressure accumulates through corporate encroachment. However, escalation happens through summary ("weeks passed") rather than dramatized beats. The final confrontation with the corporate envoy lacks specific tactical opposition—the crowd simply "gathers" without showing how Lanara's encoded messages actually mobilized them through concrete actions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of community resistance versus privatization emerges through the graffiti campaign and cooperative guilds. The foundation stone chip carries symbolic weight as unity's anchor. However, the resolution tends toward wishful thinking—"foundations could be rebuilt" feels unearned given the power differential between rafters and corporations that the story establishes but doesn't truly confront.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent third-person limited perspective but lacks distinctive texture. Lanara's "orderly intuitive" nature doesn't shape the narrative syntax or rhythm. The voice remains competent but generic—phrases like "hope flickered in her chest" and "desperation clawed at her" could appear in any story without modification.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Multiple template phrases undermine momentum: "hope flickered," "desperation clawed," "whispers loomed like storm clouds." The story relies on abstract summary ("weeks passed," "night after night") rather than compressed scene work. Information density is low—many sentences restate concepts without adding pressure or specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The graffiti-as-resistance-code concept offers freshness, and the floating carnival city provides an unusual setting. However, the gentrification narrative follows predictable beats, and the resolution—community unity defeating corporate power through collective action—lacks surprising specificity. The foundation stone chip as talisman feels forced rather than organically integrated.</comment>
