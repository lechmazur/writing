<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to understand "the geography of healing" through writing obituaries for the living is clear and distinctive, with concrete embodiment in the ritual projection. The internal contradiction between seeking connection and accepting absence drives genuine complexity. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract resolution that doesn't fully dramatize the cost of his "quiet triumph" in understanding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through layered imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias achieves understanding of "explained absences." The closure lands with emotional cost—his continued isolation balanced against wisdom gained. Slight deduction because the transformation feels more stated than fully dramatized in the final moments.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The shadowed garden with its "lonesome splendor" functions as more than backdrop—the empty harbor, moss-covered bench, and autumn decay mirror and enable Elias's ritual. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (crimson ivy, damp earth, decaying petals). The palace carpet thread serves as micro-setting that constrains and enables the projection ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding Mira's absence through projection—coheres throughout. Escalation occurs through the deepening of the ritual as the thread warms and creates "luminous pathways." However, the conflict remains largely internal without significant tightening or reversal, and the cost (continued solitude) was present from the start rather than newly incurred.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of "obituaries for the living" and "explained absences"—not abandonment but "necessary migration toward wholeness." The final image of the autumn rose "resilient against the coming frost" resonates without stating a moral. Slight deduction for moments where theme edges toward explicit statement ("understanding had bloomed").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled, literary register appropriate to the reflective protagonist. Strong perceptual signature in how Elias notices decay and splendor simultaneously. Some syntactic monotony in the longer sentences and occasional drift toward purple prose ("luminous pathways," "vivid echo of shared memories") that doesn't quite match the character's practical vocation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high, with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("forsaken cathedral," "captured starlight") and some abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy ("geography of healing" repeated without concrete grounding). No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of writing "obituaries for the living" offers genuine freshness, transforming the familiar lost-love story through this specific lens. The ritual projection using the palace thread adds originality. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure pays off, though the execution occasionally retreats to safer, more abstract territory.</comment>
