<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's methodical curiosity drives consistent micro-choices (comparing footage, mending the map), though his empathetic interpretation of silence feels more declared than embodied through contradictory impulses. The final moment of "shielded openness" understanding the henge as a portal shows earned renunciation of forceful excavation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered discoveries (indentations, light patterns, rhythmic vibrations) toward a Conceptual Repricing where the henge becomes "a portal to forgotten empathies." Cost appears in "reopened not by words, but by seeing the silence anew," though the conceptual shift could be more viscerally felt. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault constrains Elias's work through dampness and erosion that obscures crucial details, while the map's tear physically guides his investigation. Sensory detail filters through his perceptive expertise ("fragile parchment," "ghostly whispers of color"). The henge's changing alignment and shadow patterns charge the final revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Escalation accumulates through pattern recognition: indentations suggest buried artifacts, light forms "ephemeral shapes," and rhythmic vibrations reveal the henge as "living echo." The dominant stake of interpreting silence deepens when Elias discovers the portal requires empathetic seeing rather than excavation, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between forceful revelation and empathetic interpretation, crystallizing when silence becomes "a canvas for unspoken grief and hope." The final image of reopening through "seeing the silence anew" offers resonant answer without moralizing, though "forgotten empathies" edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent erudite register appropriate to Elias's expertise ("rain-scoured fresco vault," "ephemeral shapes"), with controlled rhythm that mirrors his methodical observation. Some filter-verb clusters ("seemed to exhale," "seemed to ripple") dull immediacy in peak moments. POV remains stable without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from abstract phrasing ("deep-seated need to interpret silence with empathy," "portal to forgotten empathies") and occasional template cadence in description. Lines like "centuries of seepage had blurred the once-vivid murals" show strong specificity. Some paraphrase loops around the silence/empathy concept reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of archaeological investigation through comparing silent footage across decades offers fresh angle on discovery narrative. The henge as "living echo" that requires empathetic seeing rather than excavation transforms the treasure-hunt trope, though execution sometimes favors abstraction over lived detail.</comment>
