<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find "quiet in the storm" drives consistent choices through examining ice and conjuring the bloom, with embodied tension ("steps deliberate against invisible gales"). The transformation from passive guardian to active peace-forger shows clear arc with cost. However, interiority relies on abstract declarations ("true peace wasn't fragile silence but a hammered repose") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene, and the energy beings remain faceless forces without specific pressure that would elevate character complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from disrupted harmony through ice examination to the bloom's expansion, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration when "hammered repose settled like forged armor." Cost is visible in the examination ritual and the bloom's contested emergence against the beings' storm. Orientation anchors early (harmonic caves, Elara as mapkeeper, after beings' arrival), and the pattern-taught method pays off at closure, though the energy beings' nature remains vague which slightly weakens causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glacial chamber's ice wall with "cracks spidering out like veins of frozen lightning" directly constrains Elara's method and enables the bloom—environment as active participant. Sensory hierarchy reflects mapkeeper priorities (reading patterns in ice, ripple marks), and the echo chamber stone's "gentle luminescence casting ethereal shadows" creates specific atmosphere. The harmonic caves' acoustic properties shape both problem and solution, making setting indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from general disruption to specific ice examination to the bloom's contested emergence, with the beings' "hammering energies clashing against the spreading repose" providing clear opposition. The tightening occurs when Elara must hold the conjured bloom against active resistance. However, the energy beings never adapt or specify their threat beyond "pulses of raw power," limiting the conflict's texture and preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "hammered repose"—peace forged through endurance rather than found in absence—paid off when the bloom proves "no delicate flower" but something "forged in the examination of ice." The ripple-mark maps mirror the spreading bloom, creating resonance without stating morals. The final image of "forged armor, ready for whatever storms might come" reweights the opening chaos as necessary tempering rather than pure disruption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to fantasy ("ethereal mist unfurling," "cacophony of storms") with controlled rhythm that modulates during the examination sequence. POV remains stable with Elara's mapkeeper perception filtering details. However, some passages drift into explanatory mode ("This examination wasn't mere observation; it was a ritual") and repetitive constructions appear ("The stone vibrated...The energy beings' storm met this bloom..."), preventing excellence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("cracks spidering out like veins of frozen lightning") but suffers from abstract declarations and explanatory scaffolding ("This examination wasn't mere observation; it was a ritual"). Template cadence appears in multiple sequences ("She believed...Venturing deeper...Reaching the heart..."). The paraphrase loop between "hammered repose" appearing four times with similar phrasing dulls impact, though clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of mapkeeping, ice-reading, and sound-channeling into peace-forging offers fresh angle on the harmony/chaos dynamic. "Hammered repose" as forged rather than fragile peace transforms expected resolution. The echo chamber stone that absorbs and transforms chaos rather than blocking it shows non-obvious approach. However, the energy beings as generic "luminous entities" and some fantasy conventions (ancient guardian, mystical caves) remain untransformed.</comment>
