<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation to articulate unspoken needs drives concrete action through the flower press bolt plate, with embodied tension in "translucent hands clutched." The liberation choice carries visible cost (unraveling from the machine). However, interiority relies on abstract declarations ("yearnings for connection and freedom") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene, and Lira's instant comprehension of encoded messages lacks earned struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through encoded graffiti leading to Elowen's liberation (Decisive Change with cost: his code unraveling from the machine). Who/where/when anchored early ("misty courtyard above the clouds," "Elowen," "tonight"). The because/therefore linkage from discovery of plate to encoding to Lira's arrival feels slightly convenient, but the closure lands with visible transformation and freed voice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The courtyard's "weathered marble veined with glowing runes" constrains Elowen's encoding method, and the storm's timing creates pressure windows. Setting actively shapes tactics through the "digital veins of an archaic weather machine" that traps him. The misty, suspended realm between "sky and storm" charges atmosphere throughout, though some descriptions ("floating like forgotten dreams") lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through storm pressure ("mere seconds before thunder's roar"), with Elowen's encoding racing against time. His agency drives the encoding action that leads to liberation. Cost is visible in the unraveling from the machine and foreclosure of his ghostly existence, though Lira's arrival feels coincidental rather than earned through protagonist pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken needs finding voice emerges through the graffiti encoding and final liberation, with the closing promise of "stories yet to be sung." The flower/binary fusion imagery ("roses scripted with ones and zeros") integrates digital and organic meaningfully. However, the theme explicitly states itself multiple times ("articulate unspoken needs," "unspoken needs etched there"), reducing resonance through direct declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with "tinkersong wonder" and inventive compound descriptors ("driftingly alert," "spectral minstrel"). POV remains stable with Elowen until the necessary shift to Lira. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("ethereal realm, suspended between sky and storm, pulsed with the anticipation of tempests") that strains against the established whimsical-technical fusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong moments of propulsion ("clicked and whirred, imprinting deeper layers") with varied sentence structures. Information density high in encoding sequences. However, abstract scaffolding appears ("Long ago," "Now," "Suddenly"), and some passages loop concepts ("unspoken needs, those deep yearnings for connection and freedom" restates rather than advances). Mixed metaphors occasionally muddle ("ghost in code" versus "spectral minstrel" creates competing vehicles).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ghost-in-code concept freshly synthesizes digital and spectral elements, with the flower press bolt plate as an unexpected encoding tool. The graffiti art method combining "whimsy of street scrawls with the precision of algorithms" offers genuine originality. The specific fusion of binary roses and digital vines transforms expected ghost story tropes through technical innovation.</comment>
