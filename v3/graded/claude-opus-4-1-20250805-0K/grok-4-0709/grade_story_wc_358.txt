<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her methodical investigation with embodied details like adjusting her respirator and recalibrating instruments. The flight engineer's patch discovery creates a genuine complication that shifts her hypothesis. However, the internal experience remains somewhat clinical, lacking contradictory impulses or emotional complexity beneath her professional competence, and the final resolution doesn't show a meaningful character change or cost beyond professional satisfaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain from arrival through investigation to discovery, with the patch serving as a pivot that redefines the convergence theory. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where understanding the accident's mechanics promises future prevention. However, the cost remains abstract ("oversight's cost") rather than visceral, and the ending relies on telling us about foresight rather than dramatizing a specific changed tactic or foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The container labyrinth effectively constrains movement and creates the wind-tunnel effect central to the accident, with vivid sensory details like "crunching over shattered debris" and chemical whiffs. The setting directly shapes the investigation method and causality. Minor deduction for some generic post-apocalyptic imagery ("fog clung like a shroud," "skeletal frames") that doesn't fully exploit the unique possibilities of a container port.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the accident to prevent future disasters—is clear, with escalation through the patch discovery that complicates the drone narrative. However, pressure remains intellectual rather than visceral, lacking urgency or personal cost. The investigation proceeds smoothly without meaningful obstacles or trade-offs, and the resolution doesn't show Mara sacrificing anything or facing resistance to her findings.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of foresight versus catastrophic convergence emerges through the investigation's particulars, with the wind patterns and patch discovery embodying how small factors align destructively. The concept of "singular convergence" effectively unifies the physical and thematic elements. However, the ending explicitly states the theme ("foresight needed to avert the next") rather than letting it emerge purely through image and action, and some passages feel like thesis statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The clinical, precise voice suits an investigator's POV, with technical vocabulary and methodical observations maintaining consistency. Perceptual signature shows in how Mara notices wind patterns and structural details others might miss. However, the prose lacks rhythmic variation under pressure, maintaining the same measured tone throughout, and some phrases like "hazy precision" feel forced rather than organic to the voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum through active verbs and varied sentence structures. Information density is adequate, with most lines advancing the investigation or atmosphere. Deductions for repetitive "singular convergence" usage, some purple patches ("fog clung like a shroud," "silence had fallen like a guillotine"), and the final paragraph's abstract telling that replaces concrete imagery with theme statements about "foresight" and "motivation forged anew."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The container labyrinth as wind-tunnel creator offers a fresh angle on disaster investigation, moving beyond typical accident narratives. The flight engineer's patch adds an unexpected human element to the automated drone story. However, the post-apocalyptic port setting and lone investigator archetype feel familiar, and the resolution's focus on prevention reports doesn't transform the genre sufficiently.</comment>
