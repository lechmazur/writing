<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eland's motivation is clear and consistent—transforming prophecy through shared wisdom—with embodied details like "hands calloused from flipping the endless timers." The internal drive manifests through concrete actions (cataloging buttons, unscrambling the echo) rather than mere declaration. However, his emotional response to the prophecy's transformation feels slightly underdeveloped; we see methodical work but limited internal contradiction or struggle during the crucial unscrambling sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Eland reversing the hourglass and transforming doom into "boundless grains," with visible cost in the years of solitary vigil and the cliffs' groaning release. The accumulative/textural lens holds as button cataloging builds toward the echo's unscrambling. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the prophecy's mechanics—how exactly cataloging buttons unscrambles echoes remains opaque.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The amber warehouse setting actively constrains and enables Eland's work—the buttons scattered across floors, the prophecy slab at the heart, the trapped relics all contribute to the unscrambling method. Sensory details like "walls of fossilized resin glowed with trapped sunlight" and "shadows seeping through cracks" create atmosphere while the spatial choreography of button-gathering remains coherent. The setting directly charges the final image of the warehouse "alive with the quiet hum of possibilities reborn."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing the prophesied collapse—escalates through tremors shaking the rafters, the prophecy slab humming and cracking, to the cliffs groaning in release. The accumulative pressure builds as each cataloged button reveals wisdom ("weave," flood defiance, lovers' dreams) that transforms the prophecy. Cost is visible in Eland's years of solitary work and the "raw possibility" requiring shared wisdom rather than individual force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of transforming fate through shared wisdom emerges organically from the button cataloging—each button carries a traveler's story of defying doom. The final insight that "prophecies were but echoes of choices" reweights the entire premise without explicit moralizing. The recurring motif of time (hourglasses, forgotten eras, grains of sand) effectively supports the theme of mutable destiny. Slight deduction for the abstractness of some thematic statements like "spun into possibility when wisdom was shared."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent mythic-archival voice with controlled diction ("fossilized resin," "unearthed silence") that matches the warehouse setting. POV remains stable in limited third focused on Eland, with appropriate access to his thoughts and perceptions. The perceptual signature shows in selective details like noticing button engravings and echo shifts. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds Eland's established lexicon ("raw possibility blooming within him").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Round ones with pearl sheen spoke of calm seas" combines description, cataloging action, and thematic resonance. Sentence variety creates appropriate rhythm, particularly in the cataloging sequence. However, some passages contain mild redundancy ("shared wisdom" appears four times) and occasional abstract phrasing ("raw possibility," "boundless grains") that could be more concrete. The prose generally maintains momentum toward closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The central conceit of unscrambling prophecy through button cataloging is genuinely original, avoiding typical prophecy-story templates. The specific details (amber warehouse, canyon echo in jar, buttons as story fragments) create a unique synthesis. The transformation of doom into possibility through accumulated small wisdoms rather than heroic action offers a fresh angle. Risk-taking in the unusual method pays off thematically.</comment>
