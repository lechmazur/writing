I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory mapping, discovery, and layered descriptions toward a final image of following the floating fossil.

<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "become the voice of the unknown" drives consistent action through exploration and mapping. However, her internal experience lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously - she proceeds with unwavering purpose. The final following of the fossil shows commitment but lacks visible personal cost beyond wonderment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure builds texture through cave exploration and fossil discovery, but closure lacks decisive cost. The ending - "ready to map the voices of the deep" - gestures toward future action rather than landing a present reconfiguration with felt price. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words, preventing orientation penalties.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cave network with bioluminescent fungi and geomagnetic anomalies creates vivid, purposeful setting that enables the fossil's floating. Sensory details like "dripping labyrinth of salt-crusted tunnels" and "misty echoes" support atmosphere. The environment directly constrains and enables the final floating action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on Elara's drive to map the unknown, which intensifies through fossil discovery and its floating. However, no meaningful opposition or cost emerges - the fossil cooperates perfectly, the caves pose no danger, and her mapping succeeds without trade-offs. The "extraordinary" floating moment lacks tension since it aligns with her goals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of bridging old and new worlds through sensory mapping emerges from concrete actions. The fossil as "transitional object" connects psychological and physical realms effectively. However, the ending's promise to "ensure the unknown was heard" states rather than embodies the theme, and no counter-reading or ambiguity complicates the vision.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent scientific-poetic register appropriate to Elara's profession. Perceptual signature shows through technical observations like "piezoelectric crystals" alongside wonder. No dialogue to evaluate. Some filter-verb clustering ("she felt," "she knew," "she recognized") dulls immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied syntax and purposeful technical vocabulary. However, paraphrase loops appear: "by mapping these sensations, she would speak for the enigmas" closely echoes earlier "to become the voice of the unknown." Template cadence runs through "Elara [verb]" constructions. The final paragraph's abstract promises ("would ensure the unknown was heard") replace concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The concept of sensory heat-mapping emotions offers fresh angle on post-apocalyptic exploration. Combining "factually mystical" phenomena with scientific explanation shows originality. However, the derivative post-hibernation premise and the protagonist-as-lone-explorer trope limit distinctiveness. The floating fossil moment provides one genuinely surprising turn.</comment>
