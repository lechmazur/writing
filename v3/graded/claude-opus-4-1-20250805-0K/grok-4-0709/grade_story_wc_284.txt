I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as the piece builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than strict causal progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and embodied through the pillbox and his patient waiting, with internal contradiction between his burned status and determination to repair. The final choice to trust Mira with the microfilm carries visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("dormant spark," "shadows and aliases") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the snow-encoding collaboration and Elias's realization that courage exists "in quiet, daring acts of fixing the broken." The accumulative lens holds as imagery (mist, snow, spring) builds toward this crystallization. Cost is visible in the risk of trusting Mira and the impermanence of their snow-coded message.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices through the mist's concealment and snow's impermanence as encoding medium. The "tilting earth toward spring" creates temporal pressure for their self-erasing message. Silver/mist/snow imagery coheres throughout and charges the final image of renewal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes build through accumulation: from solitary waiting to reunion to collaborative encoding, with the snow's impermanence adding urgency. The dominant stake (repairing the burned network) tightens when they must trust this ephemeral medium. Cost is legible in accepting the transient nature of their solution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of snow encoding—bold yet prudent, permanent yet fleeting. The ending reweights "unused courage" from grand gestures to "quiet, daring acts" without stating a moral. The spring thaw motif resonates with renewal without heavy-handedness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent register with selective perception fitting a burned spy (scanning horizons, measuring steps). Dialogue carries appropriate subtext and restraint. Minor deduction for occasional filter phrases ("Elias felt," "He knew") and some repetitive sentence openings in the middle section.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose generally clean with varied rhythm, though some passages lean toward the abstract ("tapestry of shadows," "dormant spark"). Information density is good in action sequences. Deduction for repetitive "silver" usage (appears 5 times) and occasional scaffold phrases that could be cut for momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The snow-as-encoding-medium offers fresh specificity to the spy genre, particularly the self-erasing aspect matching their precarious status. The collaboration through silent marking adds originality. The reframing of courage from heroic to quietly reparative provides genuine insight beyond genre expectations.</comment>
