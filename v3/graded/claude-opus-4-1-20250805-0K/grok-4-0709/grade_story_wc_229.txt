<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and his internal conviction about whispers versus shouts drives the story, but the resolution strains credibility when Mira appears alive after years presumed dead. The character's obsession feels genuine, yet the miraculous reunion undercuts the earned cost that the setup promised.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the cork's purifying essence building toward Mira's return, but the closure lacks visible cost—Elias gains everything without sacrifice. The "I heard you" resolution feels unearned given the years-long separation and no explanation of survival mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse and dawn atmosphere create vivid anchoring, with sensory details of heat breaking and sea-sky merging effectively establishing mood. The setting constrains the action to the tower's vertical space and provides the beacon as both literal and metaphoric element.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers reach farther than shouts—gets tested through the cork ritual, but escalation is minimal as Elias performs his intent-sending without opposition or complication. The miraculous resolution arrives without earned struggle or visible price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The whispers-versus-shouts theme emerges organically through Elias's actions and the mentor's dismissive bellowing, with the garden-at-night scent creating effective subtext. The final reunion validates the theme but lacks complexity since no counter-force challenges the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with lyrical touches like "cobalt lighthouse" and "screaming tenderness" that suit the romantic tone. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("tender scream that whispered across the waves") but voice remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery, though some overwrought metaphors appear ("vibrations of intent," "screaming tenderness"). The phrase "screamed in silence, tender as a lover's plea" exemplifies the occasional strain for poetic effect over clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise of magical intent-sending through a cork's essence feels derivative of typical lost-love-returns narratives. The specific detail of midnight blooms and the lighthouse setting add texture but don't transform the fundamental wish-fulfillment structure.</comment>
