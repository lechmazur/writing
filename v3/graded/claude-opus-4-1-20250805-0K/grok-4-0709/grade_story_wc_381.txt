<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to silence the prophecy is clear and consistent, driving his ritual action. However, his internal state remains largely abstract ("tranquil blaze of determination") without embodied contradiction or struggle during the ritual itself. The character functions adequately but lacks the visceral internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure that would elevate the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a form of closure through Earned Stasis—Elias successfully silences the prophecy—but the cost remains abstract ("the blaze of his motivation cooling to embers"). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with ritual steps building toward resolution, yet lacks a visible or felt price that would make the before/after transformation legible. The prophecy's actual threat never manifests concretely on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("cool grass cradling his knees," "water's gentle current"). The brook functions as more than backdrop, serving as both ritual medium and metaphorical bridge between earth and cosmos. While atmospheric, the setting doesn't quite constrain Elias's choices or create obstacles that would push toward higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing prophetic cataclysm—is declared early but never tested through concrete opposition or complication. The ritual proceeds without meaningful resistance, reversal, or tightening of options. While the prophecy's "whispered secrets" provide nominal tension, Elias faces no actual obstacles that would force adaptation or reveal cost through struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of silence versus chaos emerges through the ritual's imagery and the "terrestrially cosmic" bridge between earth and sky. The crane's origami wing carries symbolic weight as a mediator between worlds. However, the thematic resolution feels predetermined rather than discovered through struggle, and the final peace arrives without interrogating the complexity of suppressing prophecy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency with controlled, lyrical prose befitting the mystical tone ("liquid map of the heavens grounded in soil and root"). POV remains stable in third-person limited. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels disconnected from Elias's grounded perspective, particularly in abstract passages about cosmic balance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose flows smoothly but suffers from overwriting in places ("terrestrially cosmic sanctuary," "insidious spread through dreams and omens"). Several passages restate similar concepts without adding pressure, particularly around the prophecy's threat. The heavy use of abstract modifiers ("tranquil blaze," "smoothed hush") creates distance rather than immediacy, though line-level clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept of a summoner silencing prophecy through mapped silence offers a fresh angle on magical ritual. The specific method of "mapping silence" and using the crane's origami wing as a bridge between worlds shows imaginative detail. However, the execution remains somewhat generic in its mystical trappings without transforming the familiar wise-hermit-prevents-apocalypse template through lived specificity.</comment>
