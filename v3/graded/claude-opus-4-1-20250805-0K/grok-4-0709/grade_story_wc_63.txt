I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and symbolic resonance rather than strict causal chains, with the pendulum's pause serving as the crystallizing moment.

<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's guilt-driven motivation is consistent and embodied through the obsessive carving ritual. The internal conflict between his precise duty and festering guilt creates genuine tension. However, the resolution through mystical transference of inscriptions onto the brass bob feels unearned - there's no established magical realism to support this leap.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure builds effectively through the inscription ritual toward the pendulum's pause moment. The Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Elias transfers his confessions to the clock's mechanism, though the magical element ("invisible flame") breaks established realism without prior grounding. Cost is visible in his years of guilt and secret labor, but the village's healing feels asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge setting powerfully constrains the story - its tidal nature, glassy edges, and heat mirages all shape Elias's experience and mirror his internal state. The clock tower's mechanical details (spiral stairs, pendulum bob, gears) create tactile specificity. The setting actively participates in the closure through the pendulum's physical properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on restoring communal balance after the accident fractured village unity. The pressure builds through Elias's incremental confession ritual, though escalation remains largely internal. The pendulum's pause creates a meaningful tightening moment, but the resolution's ease (mystical transference instantly healing the village) undercuts earned cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of incremental absolution through small acts emerges organically from Elias's carving ritual. The pendulum as metaphor for stalled harmony works well. However, the ending's assertion that "families reconciled under the ridge's watchful gaze" tells rather than shows thematic resolution, and the mystical solution sidesteps moral complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formality appropriate to Elias's precise nature, with controlled syntax like "callused from years of meticulous adjustments." The perceptual signature focuses on mechanical precision and temporal awareness. Some overwriting appears ("metronome of fate," "soul's turmoil") but doesn't overwhelm the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variety and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is generally high, though some metaphorical excess appears ("scorching waves," "fire in his mind"). The phrase "searing reverie" repeats four times, creating intentional pattern but risking oversaturation. Line "Heat miraged off the obsidian" shows strong verb choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of guilt inscribed physically onto objects offers fresh specificity. The obsidian ridge as clock-keeper's domain creates an original setting fusion. However, the magical resolution (inscriptions transferring to brass through touch) introduces late-stage rule changes that feel convenient rather than earned through the established world.</comment>
