I'll evaluate this story through the lens of Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds atmospheric density through layered imagery and symbolic resonance rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias maintains consistent blithe characterization and his curiosity drives discovery, but his emotional response to the spectral voices lacks embodied specificity. The final choice to place the case on the grave shows agency with implied cost, though the internal contradiction between cheer and deeper pull could be more viscerally rendered.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias's act of placing the case releases the trapped echoes, with emotional cost implied through "heart aching softly." The accumulative lens holds as atmospheric details build toward this release, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than stated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt silo functions as both setting and resonance chamber, amplifying whispers into symphonies and constraining the discovery to its shadow. Sensory details like "velveteen gloom" and "loamy soil" create atmospheric density that supports the ghostly revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through the tapestry's decoding process, with echoes crescendoing as truth emerges. The stakes deepen from curiosity to redemptive responsibility, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily without testing Elias's blithe nature against darker possibilities.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of untangling threads to reveal hidden intentions, avoiding abstract moralizing. The final image of Elias humming again with "enriched" spirit resonates without stating explicit lessons about redemption or memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric voice with consistent "velveteen" texture and controlled rhythm throughout. The perceptual signature shows in details like "chess clock had run down" and "cobalt walls amplified every sound," maintaining Elias's gentle but observant perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Overwriting appears in phrases like "velveteen gloom's retreat" and "tender shape of forgotten intentions." Multiple paraphrase loops occur ("uncharted echoes"/"uncharted realms," "tenderly organized" repeated twice). The prose achieves atmospheric density but sacrifices momentum to ornamental language.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cemetery gardener discovering ghostly echoes in a silo offers a fresh angle on supernatural revelation. However, the resolution follows predictable redemption patterns without surprising transformation of the ghost story template.</comment>
