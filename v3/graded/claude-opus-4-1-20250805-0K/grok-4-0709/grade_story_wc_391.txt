I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through pattern accumulation (moon paths, patient revolution imagery) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the viaduct activation crystallizes the revolution's beginning.

<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's core contradiction between "restrained wildness" and patient strategy manifests through concrete actions like mapping moon paths and sculpting patience from the exiles' impatience. The final choice to activate the viaduct pays off this tension with visible stakes. However, the exiles remain sketched rather than embodied, and some interiority relies on abstract declarations ("vigilant horizon mapper") rather than lived moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the viaduct activation that transforms impatience into "enduring strength" and births the revolution. The accumulative lens holds as moon path patterns build toward this crystallized moment. Minor orientation wobble with "frozen lake below" at the end when they're at the viaduct in a ravine, but the closure lands with felt transformation cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary and magnetic viaduct function as active constraints—the sanctuary isolates them from the regime, the viaduct becomes the revolution's instrument. Strong sensory work: "breath fogging in the crisp air," "rain-slicked structure gleamed." The frozen lake serves as both barrier and mirror, charging the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal restraint to collective action as Elara transforms the exiles' raw fury into strategic patience, culminating in the viaduct activation. The rain's awakening of the viaduct provides the catalyst for action. While the revolution's launch carries weight, the regime remains abstract, slightly dampening the opposition's force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The patience/impatience dialectic emerges through concrete actions rather than statements, with the moon paths serving as both literal navigation and metaphor for gradual resistance. The final image of "whispers of unyoking" spreading "softly purposeful" resonates without moralizing. The revolution-as-tide metaphor occasionally feels overwrought but mostly earns its keep through specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevation with controlled rhythm: "vigilant horizon mapper," "restrained wildness," "softly purposeful." The perceptual signature focuses on boundaries and transitions fitting Elara's role. Some register drift into abstract political language ("tyrant's yoke," "patient revolution") that doesn't fully match the mythic-poetic register elsewhere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("jagged black rocks formed ancient walls against the wind"). However, abstract noun clusters appear frequently ("vigilant horizon mapper," "restrained wildness," "softly purposeful"), and some sentences rely on telling rather than embodiment. The phrase "patient revolution" appears four times, creating mild repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct as revolution infrastructure offers fresh specificity—using rain-activated magnetism to send encoded signals through buried lines. The moon-path navigation system as both celestial and strategic mapping provides original texture. While revolution narratives are common, the particular synthesis of patience-sculpting and magnetic communication creates distinctive resonance.</comment>
