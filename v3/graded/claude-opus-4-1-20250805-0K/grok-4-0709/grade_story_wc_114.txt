I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover her brother's death is clear but arrives late (paragraph 9). The fever recovery provides embodied vulnerability, yet her internal conflict lacks the simultaneous contradictory impulses required for higher bands—she moves linearly from illness to revelation without wrestling competing desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with botanical illustration serving as the focal accumulation point. However, the closure—Elara exhaling "lighter now"—lacks visible cost beyond abstract "auroral sorrow of lost years." The revelation about witnessing her brother's sabotage feels unearned without dramatized flashback or present-tense consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mountain station at 12,000 feet effectively constrains through altitude sickness and isolation. The botanical illustration's transformation from flora to hidden scale diagram provides good micro-setting work. However, the station's instruments remain background decoration rather than active constraints on choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—confronting the buried truth about her brother—emerges too late and resolves too easily through smudging margins. No meaningful tightening occurs; Thorne's guidance removes obstacles rather than intensifying pressure. The truth's revelation lacks resistance or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The weight metaphor for swallowed truth resonates but resolves into explicit theme statement: "its weight finally quantifiable—not in pounds or grams, but in the auroral sorrow." The botanical illustration's dual nature offers complexity, yet the ending's "lighter now" provides tidy resolution without earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency through elevated diction ("auroral sorrow," "fleeting beauty") appropriate to literary fiction. However, Thorne's dialogue ("You seek the measure of what you've hidden") reads stilted rather than natural. The POV occasionally slips into omniscient territory with phrases like "enigmatic figure known only as Thorne."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose suffers from overwriting: "auroral sorrow" appears three times, creating repetitive patterning. Mixed metaphors clash ("vice" of altitude sickness, truth as "bitter herb" then "weight"). Template cadence emerges in "She understood then," "She nodded," "She had come here"—reducing propulsion in critical moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The botanical illustration revealing hidden scales offers modest originality. However, the core premise—confronting buried trauma at remote location with mystical guide—follows familiar templates. The specific detail of brother's climbing "accident" being sabotage provides some freshness but isn't explored with sufficient complexity.</comment>
