<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" drives concrete choices through the translator-child interaction, with embodied details like "unsteady steps from the anesthetic's embrace." The shared anxieties between Elena and Amir create genuine emotional stakes. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("shared anxieties," "invisible threads") and the convenience of Elena's perfect dialect match.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and emotional resonance build toward the Resonant Reconfiguration where Elena and Amir transform anxiety into "shared seeds." The coral fragment's journey from Elena to Amir and the decoded poem "Wounds grow roots, then flowers" create visible emotional cost. Slight deduction for predictable resolution arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium with "vine-draped arches like whispered secrets" creates atmospheric pressure that mirrors internal states. Sensory details like "anesthetic's embrace" and "smudged notes" are selective and purposeful. The setting enables the encounter but doesn't strongly constrain choices beyond providing the meeting space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake of healing emotional wounds escalates through Elena's recognition of her own fears in Amir's anxiety about his leg. The decryption of the cast notes deepens pressure by revealing the hidden poem. Cost is visible in both characters' vulnerability, though the resolution feels slightly too neat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the coral's "labyrinthine grooves" mirroring tangled minds and the discovered poem about wounds becoming flowers. The "lotus-hearted ache" creates emotional resonance without explicit moralizing. Minor deduction for the slightly on-the-nose connection between physical and emotional wounds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with Elena's translator perspective filtering observations like "shrewdly innocent eyes." The dialogue in native dialect feels natural. Some filter-heavy passages ("Elena felt it keenly") and occasional register elevation ("labyrinthine grooves") create minor friction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments like "mist-clad atrium at twilight, where the fading light filtered through vine-draped arches." However, several paraphrase loops appear ("shared anxieties" concept repeated), some template phrasing ("Elena felt," "Elena nodded"), and occasional overwriting in metaphorical density dilutes momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The pacific translator finding connection through decrypting a refugee child's cast notes offers a fresh angle on war recovery. The brain coral as metaphor for tangled minds shows originality. However, the healing-through-connection arc follows familiar patterns without significant transformation.</comment>
