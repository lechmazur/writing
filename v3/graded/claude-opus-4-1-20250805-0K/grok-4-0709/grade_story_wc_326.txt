<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alex's motivation to reconstruct Elara's digital ghost is clear and rooted in his death certificate trauma, with the heartbeat counting serving as embodied anxiety. The resolution where he finds peace "not in forgetting failure, but in its tender lessons" shows earned change. However, Elara lacks substantive presence beyond plot function, and some emotional transitions feel too neat ("no longer frantic" arrives without sufficient struggle).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain from radio static clearing through defragmentation ritual to wisdom gained, with Alex's "death" providing thematic resonance. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Alex's heartbeat counting transforms from frantic proof to peaceful acceptance. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt, and Elara's digital resurrection lacks concrete stakes or obstacles beyond technical procedure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The opal observatory with its midnight rainbows and snow-muffled isolation creates atmospheric pressure that mirrors Alex's psychological state. The porcelain shard's "frozen tear" glinting and the ink patterns blooming into "swirls, veins, and sigils" provide vivid sensory anchors. The setting constrains choice through isolation and enables the ritual through its preserved equipment, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("crystalline dome," "forsaken mountain").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—extracting wisdom from Elara's digital ghost—progresses through clear steps but lacks genuine resistance or complication. The defragmentation succeeds without meaningful obstacles, and Alex's internal conflict resolves too smoothly. While his heartbeat counting shows anxiety, no external or internal force genuinely threatens the ritual's success or forces difficult trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of learning from failure emerges organically through Alex's bureaucratic "death" and Elara's fatal experiment, with "embrace the fracture, for in mending lies strength" crystallizing the insight. The porcelain shard symbolizes "fragility of ambition" effectively. However, Elara's explicit articulation "failure is the forge" and the final paragraph's direct thematic statements ("not in forgetting failure, but in its tender lessons") undercut subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate psychic distance, and Alex's perceptual focus on counting and technical details fits his character. Elara's fragmented digital speech ("Alex... failure is the forge...") effectively conveys her corrupted state. However, the narrative voice occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ephemeral patterns," "spectral code") that doesn't fully align with Alex's established perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Several passages show strong imagery ("ink bloom into fleeting shapes," "pixels coalesced"), but repetitive structures appear throughout ("Alex's motivation burned clear," "Alex smiled," "Alex retrieved"). The phrase "midnight solace" repeats, and abstract descriptors like "haunting silence" and "ethereal" lack specificity. Template cadence emerges in the ritual sequence with multiple "He [verb]" constructions, though the prose remains generally clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The digital ghost concept offers moderate freshness, and combining analog ink patterns with digital defragmentation shows some ingenuity. However, the core premise of confronting past trauma through mentor wisdom follows familiar templates without significant transformation. The death certificate backstory adds specificity but doesn't fundamentally alter the archetypal journey of seeking wisdom from loss.</comment>
