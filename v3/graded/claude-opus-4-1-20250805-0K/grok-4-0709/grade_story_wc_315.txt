<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve trust under pressure drives consistent choices through the crisis, with embodied stress shown through physical interaction with the parachute buckle. The internal conflict between inherited duty and innovative problem-solving creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstraction in "watcher's burden" passages that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Decisive Change closure where Elara's revised evacuation plan succeeds, transforming "peril into possibility" with visible cost (risk to community trust). The causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkages from storm damage to radio reports to revised tactics. The orientation anchors (nocturnal arbor, platforms, Elara as pattern seeker) establish clearly within the first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor setting actively constrains choices—the height enables gliding evacuation while updrafts create the central problem. Vivid selective details like "bioluminescent vines glowing faintly" and "clouds roiling silently below like a soundless sea" create atmosphere while serving tactical purposes. The parachute buckle functions as micro-setting that shapes the solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from platform fractures to evacuation crisis to trust preservation, with Elara's agency driving the resolution through inventive revision. The updraft complication forces meaningful adaptation of the original plan. Cost is visible in the risk to community trust and the physical danger of the revised parachute-tether strategy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of innovation under pressure emerges through concrete action rather than statement, particularly in the muscle memory sequences that bridge past training to present crisis. The "soundless echo" motif reinforces isolation while enabling deep thought. Some thematic tidiness in the resolution ("peril into possibility") prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent POV that modulates effectively during crisis moments. The "soundless echo" creates a unique perceptual signature. Dialogue through radio transmissions feels natural and advances plot. Minor register elevation in phrases like "ethereal realm" slightly mismatches the technical problem-solving voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some abstract phrasing ("watcher's burden," "soundless echo") appears repeatedly without always advancing pressure. Strong information density in the evacuation sequence. Template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions appears in middle sections. The paraphrase loop around "muscle memory" in paragraphs 11-13 dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sky-dwelling community with technical evacuation crisis creates non-obvious stakes. The muscle memory solution and parachute-vine tethering shows inventive problem-solving. Some familiar elements (inherited duty, community trust) prevent exceptional originality, but the nocturnal arbor setting and "soundless echo" atmosphere provide distinctive texture.</comment>
