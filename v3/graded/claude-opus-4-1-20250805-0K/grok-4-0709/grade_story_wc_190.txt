I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "teach silence how to comfort" is grounded in personal loss and manifests through concrete micro-choices (adjusting pole rhythm, using the storm glass as teaching tool). Mira's transformation from "sharp and insistent" to "whispering thanks" tracks causally, though her internal shift could use more embodied contradiction during the transition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira learns silence as comfort through the storm glass demonstration and Elias's story, with visible cost in her surrendered urgency. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through prismatic imagery, vapor channels, and the storm glass's prophetic swirls, culminating in "the vaulting hush reigning supreme."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace creates a unique otherworld where "crystalline platforms floated like shards of captured rainbow" and constrains movement to gondola channels. The storm glass vial functions as micro-setting that directly shapes Mira's choice to embrace silence. Sensory detail filters through Elias's gondolier perspective ("vaporous channels," "gentle laps").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Mira's demand for "haste" through her resistance ("It's too quiet") to acceptance, with the storm glass revealing how "disturbances agitated the liquid" versus stillness bringing clarity. The cost appears in her surrendered urgency and changed breathing, though the middle resistance could deepen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the storm glass metaphor: internal storms versus clarity in stillness, without explicit moralizing. The final image of "dawn's light fractured through the prisms" while "the vaulting hush reigning supreme" offers a non-literal answer about finding peace through acceptance rather than flight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice with lyrical compression ("drifting prism terrace," "sky-sea," "vaporous channels") that maintains consistency. Elias's sparse dialogue contrasts effectively with Mira's initial chatter. The perceptual signature focuses on sound levels and atmospheric quietude fitting a gondolier who has "long surrendered to the winds."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, but several redundancies weaken momentum: "ephemeral dock to another" after establishing transit, "Mira complained, her words echoing" (double-tagged dialogue), "watched her shoulders relax" following established calm. The phrase "fluidly logical realm where winds followed predictable currents" feels forced to incorporate the required attribute.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The gondola-as-therapy-vessel in a floating prism world offers a fresh frame for examining silence versus noise. The storm glass as prophetic emotional barometer is inventive. However, the transformation arc (troubled person learns peace through quiet wisdom) follows familiar patterns despite the unique setting.</comment>
