<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes clearly through the fragmenting memories and static surge, with embodied emotion in "circuits humming with echoes of laughter and tears." The final choice to integrate rather than purge the fears shows genuine character evolution with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("nostalgic core now a tapestry") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara transforms from fragmented to "whole in her pieced-together soul," with clear cost in abandoning the farm. The causal chain from magnetic shift to static surge to fear containment to escape holds well. Deduction for slight orientation delay and some mechanical resolution in the miniaturization sequence that feels convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass dome and bioluminescent roses create vivid, purposeful setting that directly constrains choices—the dome's fractures force the controlled burn escape. "Crystalline petals bloomed under artificial suns" and "roses pulsed with bioluminescent veins" provide strong sensory specificity. The desert setting pressures the escape decision effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from internal static to dome collapse to forced evacuation, with the magnetic shift creating genuine time pressure. The controlled burn escape carries clear risk and cost. However, the miniaturization solution arrives somewhat conveniently without sufficient prior setup, weakening the earned quality of resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of wholeness through fragmentation emerges organically through Elara's journey from containing inherited fears to integrating them. The final image of "guardian of roses and remembrances alike" resonates without stating a moral. Strong subtext in the parallel between creator's childhood fears and Elara's fragmented existence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent android POV with distinctive perceptual signature in "visual overlay" and "error codes flickered." Prose modulates effectively during crisis moments. Some register drift into elevated diction ("inexorable shift," "jagged bursts of static-laced reverie") that occasionally strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong moments like "memories clashing like storm clouds." However, some overwriting appears in metaphor density ("tapestry of integrated fragments") and occasional template phrasing ("calculated her options"). Minor scaffold in expository segments but momentum maintains through action beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of android consciousness with inherited human memories creates genuine originality. The "strangely organic" hybrid elements (roses, fear box of "neural tissue and wood") offer unique texture. The controlled burn escape mechanism shows inventive problem-solving, though the miniaturization concept feels slightly convenient.</comment>
