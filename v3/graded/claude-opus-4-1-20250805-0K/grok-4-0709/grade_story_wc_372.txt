I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent - preserving fading knowledge drives every action. Her "gently meticulous" trait manifests through concrete actions like "fingers that danced like whispers" and careful frequency sampling. However, internal conflict remains underdeveloped; she experiences urgency and ache but no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward closure. Elara successfully preserves the vows in crystal vials, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("trembling slightly"). The orientation anchors (frozen library, Elara as records chief) establish clearly by line 2, and causality holds throughout the preservation process.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen library setting actively constrains choices - the ice preservation system, cloud-quartz projector, and "frost etched ancient tomes" create a lived-in magical archive. Sensory details like "quartz hush" and "tiny fractals of ice" thawing support the atmosphere. The setting enables the preservation method and charges the final image of sealed vials as "a beacon against the endless fade."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake - preserving history before illusions vanish - creates genuine urgency with "the last shimmer" threatening oblivion. Escalation occurs through increasingly significant vows (unity→protection→guardianship), with the final one "fracturing like shattering ice." However, no meaningful reversal or complication tests Elara's commitment; she succeeds without adaptation or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of preserving ephemeral promises - memory versus oblivion resonates without being stated. The luminous vows carry subtext about forgotten commitments, with frequencies revealing "passion" and "enduring resolve." The final image of vials as "a beacon against the endless fade" offers a non-literal answer about preservation's value.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the fantasy setting - "crystalline silence," "spectral remnants," "cosmic depth." The perceptual signature focuses on light, preservation, and careful measurement. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains stable in close third, though some phrases like "profound urgency gripped her" could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied sentence structures and paragraph lengths creating visual rhythm. Information density is high - most sentences advance atmosphere, action, and theme simultaneously. However, some redundancy appears: "fading/fade/faded" variants occur 8 times; "gently meticulous" repeats verbatim. The magic system description maintains clarity despite complexity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds offers a fresh setting, and luminous vows as light-frequencies present an original preservation concept. However, the core premise - archivist races to save fading knowledge - follows a familiar template without significant transformation. The execution is competent but doesn't risk bold structural or thematic choices.</comment>
