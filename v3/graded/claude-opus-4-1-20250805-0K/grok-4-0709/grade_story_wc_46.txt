Looking at this story through an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered memories, repeated phrases, and the gradual transformation of the sea glass into a luminous pearl.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—sharing light without fire after burning worlds—drives consistent action through the polishing process. Her internal conflict between cosmic guilt and earthbound redemption manifests concretely. However, the weighing sequence feels slightly mechanical, and some emotional beats rely on abstract declarations ("memories resurfaced" appears five times) rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres well: memories layer progressively while the sea glass transforms, culminating in Elara releasing the pearl's glow to help villagers—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (accepting earthbound limitation). The repeated "memories resurfaced" creates rhythm and deepening. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract final village moment that could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto with its mist, whispering waters, and filtering starlight creates atmospheric pressure that shapes Elara's work. The setting constrains her choice (earthbound, limited to what the grotto provides) and enables her solution (sands, dew, mist as tools). Some descriptions lean purple ("languid curls") but the grotto functions as more than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the accumulative pattern: from kneeling contemplation to active polishing to weighing doubt to final release. Each memory surge ("fiery descents," "worlds lit ablaze," "stars weeping") raises the emotional cost of her past failures, making the gentle solution more urgent. The weighing moment creates genuine tension about whether small acts can redeem cosmic harm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the fire/light dichotomy and the transformation of destructive force into gentle illumination. The sea glass becoming a "pearl of stillness" that radiates peace without burning resonates beyond plot mechanics. The ending achieves thematic closure without stating its moral, though phrases like "testament to gentle rebirth" edge toward explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lyrical voice suits the mythic register with controlled rhythm and purposeful repetition. POV remains stable with Elara's cosmic perspective filtering earthly details. However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("serpentine grotto veiled by eternal mist"), and some sentences strain for effect rather than precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Memories resurfaced" appears five times, creating both pattern and redundancy. Several passages loop concepts ("light without fire" variations, multiple phrasings of redemption). Purple patches like "zephyr's caress" and "languid curls" slow momentum. The prose achieves moments of clarity but accumulates enough ornamental language to dull impact, particularly in the middle sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise of a fallen celestial being finding redemption through patient craftsmanship offers a fresh angle on cosmic guilt narratives. The specific method—polishing sea glass with grotto materials rather than celestial fire—feels earned. However, the execution relies on some familiar fantasy tropes (fallen angel, redemption through humble acts) without fully transforming them.</comment>
