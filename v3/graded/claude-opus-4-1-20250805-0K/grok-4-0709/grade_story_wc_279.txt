<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "discover meaning in the mess" drives concrete action through the mandala creation, with her social perceptiveness enabling key insights about the group's interconnected struggles. The choice to interject represents a meaningful micro-choice under pressure, though the resolution trends toward collective harmony without strong individual cost or internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the mandala's creation building density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where individual struggles cohere into collective understanding. The "emergent hush" and shared participation constitute visible change, though the cost remains primarily atmospheric rather than decisively felt—the "tentative peace" suggests transformation without showing what was sacrificed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto's mist and echoing walls actively shape the narrative, with the "lilac unease" permeating both atmosphere and emotional register throughout. The whispering gallery tile flake and sand mandala function as micro-settings that constrain choices and enable the final transformation, particularly when the tile "absorb[s] the grotto's echoes" at the mandala's center.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on discovering "meaning in the mess" during the unlearning, with tension building through the group's visible unease and Elara's decision to create the mandala. The interjection represents the primary escalation point, though the resolution toward "tentative peace" lacks a sharp trade-off or foreclosed option that would heighten cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mandala's patterns revealing "shared path through the mess toward something whole," avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of collective creation and "beauty of connection born from chaos" resonates without stating its lesson, though the "tentative peace" slightly softens what could be a more complex ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent whimsical-mystic register with controlled diction like "lilac-hued discomfort" and "emergent hush," though Elara's brief dialogue lacks the distinctiveness of the narration. The perceptual signature focuses on visual patterns and social undercurrents, supporting her artist-observer role.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages like "vibrant blues, earthy reds, and that pervasive lilac." Some redundancy appears in phrases like "murmurs blending into a cacophony" and "disorienting swirl" that restate similar ideas, and occasional overwriting ("testament to the unlearning's gentle power") dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The sand mandala as communal revelation tool offers a fresh angle on group therapy dynamics, and the "unlearning" concept provides non-obvious framing. However, the resolution toward collective understanding through shared creation follows familiar workshop/retreat patterns without significant transformation of the trope.</comment>
