<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Amir's motivation is crystalline—survivor's guilt transmuted into obsessive quest—with embodied contradiction between scientific detachment and raw grief. The geode moment where he sees his bride's face in the data shows internal conflict acting in scene. Loses points for some diagnostic self-awareness ("cracked something open in him") and the final vow feels slightly hedged between vengeance and renewal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Amir touches the pool and commits to "awaken what the world had buried," paying emotional cost through his obsessive hunt. The perturbation-by-perturbation build creates density increase toward the final pool discovery. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of "unused potential" not fully dramatized in physical terms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating observatory constrains Amir's window of opportunity during cooldown, while the geode amplifies his search—both environment and object shape tactics. Vivid sensory work: "holographic displays projecting fractals," "glittering quartz within." The homeland ruins below and storm clouds create vertical geography that matters to the final pool's location.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation—each perturbation reveals more pools until the "ultimate pool" appears over his homeland. The cooldown window creates time pressure, external winds threaten the observatory's stability. Cost is visible in Amir's "bleak exhilaration" and the pools representing "lives unlived, loves unblossomed," though the final touch remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete hunt for "unused potential"—a non-literal answer to loss and renewal. The geode's rough exterior hiding crystals mirrors Amir's scarred exterior containing possibility. The final commitment to "draw from it not vengeance, but renewal" reweights the entire hunt without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature of a physicist-survivor: equations whispered, perturbation theory applied to grief, technical vocabulary naturally integrated. Some register drift into elevated diction ("intangibly tangible force," "quantum foam") that occasionally strains the traumatized POV. Strong psychic distance control as Amir moves between technical focus and emotional breakthrough.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "unused potential pools"/"hidden reservoirs"/"pools of unused potential" recycle across paragraphs. Template cadence in middle section ("Amir's eyes widened...Amir's heart pounded"). Mixed metaphor of potential as both "whisper made solid" and "quantum foam" creates slight confusion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of drone warfare trauma with quantum physics creates non-obvious angle—using perturbation theory to hunt metaphysical pools of lost possibility. The wedding-to-observatory journey and scientist-survivor combination feel specific. Loses some points for the somewhat familiar "tragic loss leads to obsessive quest" arc, though the scientific method application adds distinction.</comment>
