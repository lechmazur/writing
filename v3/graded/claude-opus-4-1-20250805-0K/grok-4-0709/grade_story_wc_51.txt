<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The weaver's motivation to collect burdens and escape her fractal prison is clear and drives meaningful choices. Her internal contradiction between helping others while remaining trapped creates genuine tension. The transformation from trapped to free is earned through the accumulation of collected burdens, though the emotional embodiment could be more visceral during peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when she calcifies her own trap and steps free, with visible cost in the accumulated weights. The accumulative/textural lens holds as she collects and transforms burdens into physical weights that enable escape. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the pattern of collection-to-calcification builds coherently to the final transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bronze grotto's walls "gleaming like ancient shields" and the kerosene lamp's flame creating "a grid of luminous lines" directly enable the calcification ritual. The starlight's geometry must align with the lamp to transform burdens, making setting essential to the story's mechanics. The "shingled hush" as layered silence effectively creates atmospheric pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate as each collected burden paradoxically tightens the weaver's own trap while providing the means for escape. The accumulation of calcified weights builds pressure toward the final meta-pattern that breaks her prison. Cost is visible in both the travelers' relief and the weaver's increasing confinement until the climactic reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of transformation through burden-collection emerges organically from the action without explicit moralizing. The final image of the empty grotto with the extinguished lamp resonates as release after accumulation. The paradox of helping others to help oneself avoids tidy resolution, leaving complexity in the abandoned weights.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent mythic-lyrical register with phrases like "boundary-lessly trapped" and "whalebone reverie" that match the fantastical premise. The controlled repetition of "orient," "calcify," and "fractal" creates rhythmic cohesion. Some filter phrases like "she realized" and "she believed" could be more immediate, particularly during the ritual sequences.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "fingers spun patterns that repeated infinitely, each loop birthing smaller echoes." Several paraphrase loops appear, notably "boundary-lessly trapped"/"endless recursion" and the repeated explanation of calcification mechanics. Template cadence emerges in "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs, dulling momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a being who must collect others' burdens to escape her own recursive prison offers a fresh synthesis. The specific mechanics of orienting starlight through lamp flame to calcify abstract weights into lime-hardened stones shows imaginative specificity. The fractal-weaver trapped in her own creations avoids generic fantasy tropes through precise world-logic.</comment>
