<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation builds from coral bleaching trauma through rhythmic tapping to the father's confession, with visible cost in tears and isolation. The tapping habit effectively embodies her communion with ocean patterns, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("drifting moored existence"). The final choice to share the revelation carries earned weight from her witnessing role and father's betrayal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through rhythmic tapping that builds to decode hidden coordinates and father's confession, with clear cost in confronting denial's legacy. The revelation lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—paths didn't vanish but submerged, reweighting all prior monitoring work. Orientation anchors clearly (Driftmoor Station, Pacific, post-ban era) and causality holds through pattern accumulation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The station's solar pods and storm-lashed dome constrain Elara's investigation to limited materials while embodying humanity's "belated penance." Sensory detail filters through her expertise ("flooded reality," "acidified waters"). The atlas page's physical indentations critically enable the Morse discovery, making setting instrumental to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure builds through tapping rhythms that evolve from habit to method to revelation, with the storm intensifying urgency. The dominant stake—discovering vanished migration paths—tightens when Morse patterns reveal both answer and father's complicity. Cost manifests in tears and the weight of sharing truth "with a world still healing."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "drifting moored"—tethered yet adrift—which resonates through Elara's vigil and humanity's relationship with irreversible change. The "periodically eternal" cycles offer redemption through persistence despite human folly. The father's hidden confession transforms witnessing from observation to active atonement, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent scientific-poetic register ("renewable whispers," "defiant swells") with controlled rhythm that mirrors ocean cycles. Perceptual signature shows through technical focus ("thermoclines," "bioluminescent panels") filtered with emotional weight. Some passages drift toward elevated diction ("vast embrace") but rhythm control during the revelation sequence is strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves density through compound images ("solar-powered pods bobbing like forgotten buoys") and varies sentence length effectively. Some figurative language feels forced ("denial burned hotter than the sun") and occasional abstraction dulls immediacy ("tone of drifting moored existence"). The revelation sequence maintains clear propulsion through concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of climate monitoring station with personal archaeological discovery through Morse-coded atlas page offers fresh angle on climate fiction. The father's dual role as navigator/denier who teaches the decoding method adds non-obvious complexity. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and "drifting moored" paradox heightens meaning without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
