<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and her pacifist stance drives meaningful choices, particularly in choosing to "stitch" rather than destroy. However, her internal conflict feels somewhat abstract—the "suppressed rage" and "buried grief" arrive as labels rather than embodied contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to open the dimension has visible consequence but lacks the visceral cost of competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration as Lira opens the portal, with clear cost paid through confronting shadows. The accumulative/textural lens holds as she progresses through photographs, each building toward the final transformation. However, the shadow work mechanics feel somewhat mechanical—each photograph predictably yields a shadow that's immediately integrated without genuine struggle or surprise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship setting effectively constrains the story to archived memories and creates atmosphere through "dim corridors" and "low-power hum." The photographs as portals and Kwan Yin's tear work as micro-settings that enable key choices. The gravitational lightness when happy provides a unique physical manifestation that charges the final ascension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—opening the locked dimension—and pressure builds through successive photograph encounters. Each shadow integration meaningfully deepens Lira's capacity, culminating in the portal opening. However, the conflicts lack genuine resistance; each shadow yields too easily to stitching, and there's no moment where Lira's pacifism genuinely costs her or forces a harder choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the shadow work concept—integration of rejected aspects enabling transcendence. The photographs' tears becoming a dimensional map provides concrete imagery for abstract healing. The ending offers resonant completion as humanity's echoes find rebirth through Lira's peaceful integration rather than violent breakthrough.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent ethereal quality appropriate to the ghostly protagonist, with effective modulation as Lira grows lighter with joy. Perceptual signature shows in how she processes the photographs' "shimmer" and "crystalline traces." Some passages drift into elevated register ("steadfast pacifist forged from merged consciousness") that slightly distances from immediate experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm, particularly in the photograph sequences. Information density is high—most sentences advance both plot and atmosphere. However, some template patterns emerge ("She selected one," "Lira glided," "Threads of light extended") and abstract descriptors like "ghostly resolve" and "ethereal" could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of spectral consciousnesses doing shadow work through photograph-memories offers fresh angle on post-human narrative. The gravitational lightness tied to happiness provides unique physical manifestation of emotional state. The peaceful "stitching" approach to integration rather than confrontation transforms expected shadow work dynamics.</comment>
