I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory details, metaphorical layering (lighthouse/keeper, pearl/stillness), and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elias transforms grief into grounded hope.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied trauma response ("body reacted first," "tightening in his chest") and credible PTSD portrayal with somatic markers driving the climactic freeze. The transformation from paralysis to movement feels earned through accumulated detail, though "optimism felt grounded" edges toward telling rather than embodying the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis - Elias accepts his loss while choosing to tend life, with visible cost in the trembling hands and years of isolation. The accumulative lens holds as density increases toward the pearl moment, though the final paragraph slightly over-explains what the imagery already conveys.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The arboretum-on-cliff setting actively constrains choices (isolation, harsh conditions) while enabling transformation (nurturing against odds). Exceptional integration of "salt-laden winds," the abandoned lighthouse below, and the pearl-producing plant as micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative pressure - from quiet tending to trauma trigger to breakthrough - with the pearl becoming tactile proof of his motivation. The "distant rumble" effectively catalyzes the crisis, though the resolution could show more immediate cost beyond trembling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lighthouse keeper parallel and pearl-of-stillness metaphor without stating morals. The final image of walking forward "ready to face whatever came next" resonantly reweights the opening wandering, though "optimism felt grounded" briefly lapses into abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with strong perceptual signature ("salt-laden winds whispered," "pearl-like nodules that gleamed"). Some filter-verb clustering ("he believed," "he imagined," "he thought") during the crisis slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery ("sky rained fire," "pearl of stillness"). Minor redundancies appear ("anchor optimism in realism" echoed conceptually in "optimism felt grounded") and "quietly talented" reads as prompt-insertion rather than organic voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of PTSD recovery through botanical metaphor, avoiding therapy-speak for embodied healing. The pearl-as-beacon inversion of the dead lighthouse shows originality, though the wedding-drone-strike combination feels slightly derivative of contemporary conflict narratives.</comment>
