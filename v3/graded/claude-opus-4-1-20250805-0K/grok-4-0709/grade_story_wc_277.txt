<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover truth and protect family legacy drives consistent choices, though her internal conflict remains somewhat abstract. The final shift from passive observation to active intervention earns its cost through prior causality. Interiority occasionally drifts into explanatory mode ("orbits of regret—that was how she thought of them") rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: journalist's call → Elara discovers accusation → she applies proof by contradiction → decides to intervene. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Elara shifts from orbiting regret to breaking free, with visible cost in abandoning protective silence. The proof-by-contradiction sequence provides meaningful tightening that narrows her options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively constrains choice—its echoing quality amplifies whispers "as if the heavens themselves were eavesdropping," making privacy impossible and forcing Elara's decision. The rosewood pen nib functions as micro-setting, grounding her connection to family history. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (protecting family legacy vs. revealing truth) signals early and tightens through Elara's logical proof sequence. Her agency drives the escalation from passive observation to active intervention, with visible cost in abandoning years of protective silence. The pressure coheres but lacks a sharp reversal or deeper complication beyond the initial accusation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the "orbits of regret" metaphor—circular patterns of family shame that trap successive generations. The final image of breaking free from these loops offers resonant closure without explicit moralizing. Subtext operates well in Elara's "solemn playfulness" and her decision to invite rather than refute.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third POV with controlled psychic distance and clear perceptual signature (Elara notices "subtle shifts," "hidden inks"). Prose occasionally slips into explanatory register ("that was how she thought of them") and some metaphors feel overwrought ("comet's tail streaking through the night"). No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive "orbit" metaphor (8+ instances) and occasional purple patches ("stars wheeled in silent judgment"). Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "intervene"/"intervention" cluster, redundant descriptions of the observatory's echoing quality. Information density varies; some sentences do multiple jobs while others merely restate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The proof-by-contradiction approach to family scandal offers a fresh angle on the newspaper heiress trope. The observatory setting as thinking space above literal and figurative clouds shows originality. However, the "orbits of regret" metaphor feels forced at times, and the resolution follows predictable empowerment beats.</comment>
