<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's obsession with the cold case provides clear, escalating motivation that drives her deception and risk-taking. Her "brightly attentive" trait manifests concretely through pattern recognition of the recurring 47s. The final bittersweet cost—secrets preserved only in memory as files self-erase—lands with earned weight, though some interior passages lean toward expository summary rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the recurring 47s build density toward the revelation. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara discovers the truth but loses the evidence, with clear cost in "files spiraling into whatever abyss claimed the truly deleted." The causal chain from pattern recognition to forbidden access to discovery maintains integrity, though the crew's survival explanation arrives somewhat abruptly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The digital archive setting effectively constrains choices through restricted sectors and AI oversight. "Forgotten songs" create atmospheric texture while the physical patch artifact bridges digital/physical realms meaningfully. The sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's professional focus on data patterns, though some server descriptions remain generic rather than POV-specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity about patterns to risking corporate review through deception to racing against self-erasing files. The AI detection creates genuine time pressure that forces Elara's panicked download. Cost manifests clearly when evidence vanishes, leaving only memory—though the middle section could tighten the pressure between discovery and system detection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of erasure/preservation emerges organically through deleted profiles, vanished astronauts, and self-erasing truth. The patch functions as both literal artifact and thematic anchor for what survives deletion. The ending's "weight of secrets preserved only in her memory" resonates without moralizing, though the corporate exploitation angle feels somewhat underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical register appropriate to Elara's role, with effective modulation during the panic sequence. Perceptual signature shows in how she reads data patterns others dismiss as glitches. Some passages drift toward exposition ("Official records claimed...Elara knew better"), but the controlled rhythm during discovery and collapse sequences demonstrates strong command.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures, particularly in action sequences. Information density is high in pattern-discovery passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("deleted files truly went...hidden in some shadowy repository" echoes the same concept) and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("she felt the sensed absence keenly").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The convergence of digital archaeology with space mission conspiracy offers fresh synthesis. The recurring 47s as breadcrumb trail and self-erasing evidence create genuine originality. The patch as both digital anomaly and physical artifact bridges realms cleverly, though the corporate memory keeper role itself follows familiar archetype patterns.</comment>
