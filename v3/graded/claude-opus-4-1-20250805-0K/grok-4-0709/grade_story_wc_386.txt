<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "salvage something pure from the wreckage" drives consistent choices through ghost communication and careful truth-weaving, with internal complexity shown through her methodical analysis of dream cameos. The final choice to share truth "without blame's sharp edges" demonstrates earned character growth with visible emotional cost in protecting descendants' peace.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through layered ghost whispers, dream analysis patterns, and the melted globe's amplification effect, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's guided dream sessions will expose injustice "gently." The closure lands with conceptual cost—the cabin boy's eternal suffering revealed—though the emotional price could be more visceral in Elara's own experience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine with its "walls glistening like frozen tears under the flicker of wax flames" creates atmospheric pressure that constrains Elara's movements through narrow tunnels. The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting, its "warped glass" actively enabling the ghost communication that drives the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking "a fragment of untainted soul" to uncovering the captain's betrayal and innocent cabin boy's sacrifice, with the melted globe amplifying ghost communications as pressure mechanism. The cost—eternal unrest for the innocent—is clear, though Elara faces limited personal risk beyond empathetic burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of carefully woven truth versus destructive revelation emerges through the contrast between the captain's buried betrayal and Elara's gentle exposure method. The "borrowed starlight" motif effectively frames how truths are "loaned from distant cosmos," culminating in the final image of brighter starlight after "one pure thing" is rescued.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" and "windows of connection," though some passages drift into elevated register ("cascades of strangers' subconscious scenes"). The perceptual signature of analyzing ghost cameos in dreams is distinctive but occasionally strains credibility without more grounding in how Elara accesses others' dreams.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from abstract phrasing ("fragment of untainted soul," "windows of connection") that could be more concrete. Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the ghost communication concept being restated without added pressure. The "borrowed starlight" metaphor works but risks overextension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of Arctic exploration tragedy with ghost whispering through dream analysis offers a fresh angle, particularly the specific method of tracking spectral "cameo appearances" in unrelated dreams. The melted snow globe as corrupted talisman that amplifies ghost communications is inventive, though the resolution method feels somewhat safe.</comment>
