<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reaper's heartbreak drives concrete actions through crystallizing fears into named objects, with internal contradiction between his immortal nature and mortal pain. The final choice to transform grief into "quiet legacy" shows earned change through prior causality with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through crystallized fears building toward the resonant reconfiguration where naming transforms grief. Cost is legible in "heartbreak eased fractionally" and the persistent constraint of enforced sacrifice shapes the ritual's purpose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory's mirrors, prisms, and phonograph constrain the ritual method while celestial charts pulse with "distant intimacy." The scattered light mechanism directly enables crystallization, making setting essential to closure rather than ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation as each crystallized fear ("Despair's Grasp," "Void's Whisper," "Fate's Shackle") builds pressure toward transformation. The cost appears in "heartbreak eased fractionally" though the escalation could tighten further through more resistance or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete crystallization of intangible fears without stating morals. The final image of "quiet legacy" and "finding solace in the dusk's embrace" reweights the sacrifice from loss to transformation, though some naming feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "shadows that whispered of eternal loss" and controlled psychic distance throughout. Some elevated diction ("ephemeral," "kaleidoscope") occasionally drifts from the established register but rhythm modulates effectively with the ritual's progression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some metaphorical density in peak beats ("shadows that whispered," "walls...seemed to pulse") without clear payoff. Minor template cadence in "One by one...A phrase materialized...Another echo followed" sequence detracts from otherwise strong prose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of crystallizing emotional echoes through refracted light offers fresh synthesis of reaper mythology with observatory setting. The specific fear names and their physical manifestations show genuine invention though the resolution trends slightly safe.</comment>
