<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper's motivation "to witness change without judgment" drives consistent characterization, and his shimmering form that "gripped reality loosely" creates a coherent supernatural observer. The final choice to return and repeat the ritual shows earned endurance with visible cost ("crumbling peace of his existence"). However, internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied in scene, and no contradictory impulses act simultaneously during observation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis—the keeper's cyclical return reinforces his eternal vigil with the cost of "crumbling peace." The accumulative/textural lens holds as seasonal drift and regenerative silence build toward this resonant reconfiguration. Orientation anchors clearly by line 4, and the cryptic folds create a coherent portal mechanism. Deducting for cost visibility—while "crumbling peace" is named, the specific price of endless observation could be more viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The overgrown library and obsidian refuge create vivid, purposeful settings that constrain the keeper's journey through the cryptic folds. Sensory details like "faint drip of water echoing" and "walls pulsing with echoes" ground the atmosphere. The origami swan functions as micro-setting that enables passage between realms. Setting directly shapes the final image of return, earning the 9-gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—witnessing without judgment—remains consistent but lacks meaningful tightening beyond the keeper's decision to venture forth and return. Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through seasonal drift and regenerative silence, but no live option is foreclosed with visible cost until the final return. The obsidian refuge sequence observes change but doesn't force a trade-off or narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the keeper's neutral observation and the regenerative silence that "mended fractures of the soul." The discovery of distant civilizations creating origami swans provides thematic resonance without explicit moralizing. The final image of the "endless, impartial dance" offers a non-literal answer to questions of permanence and change. Subtext operates through the cost of eternal watching embedded in "crumbling peace."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through phrases like "eyes like faded ink" and selective attention to decay and transformation. Voice maintains consistency through elevated, contemplative diction appropriate to an ageless observer. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("regenerative silence worked its magic") that edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of beauty ("Vines twisted through cracked stone shelves, cradling forgotten tomes") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "regenerative silence" (4 instances) and "drift of untold seasons" (3 instances). Template cadence appears in the observation sequence ("Forests bloomed and withered, cities rose...wars igniting"). Information density is moderate—some passages do single duty. The paraphrase loop between "regenerative silence...mended the fractures" and "regenerative silence worked its magic" triggers -0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The origami swan as portal device offers fresh specificity, and the chronicle keeper as eternal neutral observer avoids typical wise-mentor tropes. The concept of "regenerative silence" that heals through observation provides an original angle. However, the cyclical structure and themes of eternal watching echo familiar literary patterns without sufficient transformation through lived detail.</comment>
