I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered imagery, metaphor accumulation, and pattern density toward a resonant reconfiguration where Liora shifts from seeking closure to "tunneling into the hush where questions could breathe."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with contradictory impulses ("wanted to read it the way she read the coffee rings") and earned final renunciation. The protagonist's shift from closure-seeker to question-carrier shows genuine cost through the mother's file revelation. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in middle sections.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("Some stories weren't meant to be read. They were meant to be carried"). The accumulative lens holds through metaphor density and pattern breaks. Deduction for slightly unclear causality around the telepathy's emergence and its exact relationship to the surgical scar.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exceptional integration where setting constrains and charges closure - the tower as "splinter," its "stone skin," the frozen hourglass all create pressure that shapes the final image. The tower's wounds mirror Liora's scar, creating resonant specificity. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure - from hearing plants to understanding she "was the thing in the walls" to confronting her mother's file. The dominant stake (seeking closure vs. carrying wounds) tightens meaningfully. Cost is legible in the final acceptance of open wounds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through concrete particulars without stating a moral. "Displaced miracles—that's what scars were" reweights all prior wound imagery. The ending offers a non-literal answer about wounds as memory-holders rather than things to decode, avoiding sentimentality through specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with selective attention ("coffee rings...concentric confessions"). Voice maintains consistency through lyric compression and metaphorical density. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the POV's established range ("accidentally telepathic").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in peak beats ("sand hissed onto the sill, counting down to something") without full payoff. Template cadence appears briefly ("She turned...She pressed...She was"). No major loops but occasional abstract phrasing dilutes momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of medical trauma, plant telepathy, and archival work creates fresh emotional territory. The concept of scars as "displaced miracles" and wounds that "whisper if you knew how to listen" transforms familiar material. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes (+0.3).</comment>
