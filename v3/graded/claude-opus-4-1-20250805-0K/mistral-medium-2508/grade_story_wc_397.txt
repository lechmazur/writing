I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's rigorous standards for a 600-800 word piece.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered images and pattern breaks toward Lior's final stance crystallization.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lior's transformation from seeking endings to choosing presence is earned through concrete details (parasol tip divining safe passage, the dog's recognition). Internal contradiction operates throughout ("the kind of laugh that belonged to someone who still expected good things"). Minor deduction for the grandmother's initials revelation feeling slightly convenient, though it works thematically.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) - Lior's choice to stay and listen carries visible cost through canceled appointment and acceptance of "slow unraveling." The accumulative lens holds as density builds from silence to ice-walking to final listening. Deduction for the "E.M./Endings Matter" turn feeling forced rather than organic to the pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina and frozen fjord actively constrain choices (testing ice with parasol, jagged canal forcing careful passage). Sensory hierarchy reflects Lior's state - from pressed silence to salt and distant rain. The ice's groaning bookends create resonant frame. Setting functions as more than backdrop, shaping each key decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from personal (euthanasia appointment) through immediate risk (ice crossing) to existential choice (staying for "slow unraveling"). The ice-walking scene provides concrete test with visible danger. Cost is legible but the middle section could tighten - the villagers' reaction dilutes momentum slightly before the stronger ending beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: parasol as divining rod, ice as threshold, the dog's recognition suggesting connection beyond death-seeking. The final image of listening to ice "like a door closing softly somewhere far away" offers non-literal answer to the central question. "Solace as space between breaths" avoids sentimentality through specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout - Lior notices silence as pressure, traces patterns for comfort, moves "as if patience were something you could fold." The lyric compression works ("trawling for meaning in the wreckage"). Minor inconsistency in register when explaining the euthanasia tourism feels slightly clinical against the otherwise impressionistic voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the parasol tip—her grandmother's lace-wrapped silver, the only heirloom she'd kept—dug into her palm"). Some filter verb accumulation ("she realized," "she understood") in the resolution slightly dulls immediacy. The prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The euthanasia tourist seeking endings through disaster relief offers fresh angle on familiar death/life themes. Specific details (one blue eye, dried fish as offering) elevate beyond template. The parasol as ice-testing tool transforms the heirloom trope. Slight deduction for the initials revelation feeling mechanically inserted rather than discovered.</comment>
