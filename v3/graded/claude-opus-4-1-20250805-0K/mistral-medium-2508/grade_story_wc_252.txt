<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from dock worker to whale-form is earned through concrete sensory details (scrimshaw warming against thigh, ribs aching to expand) and the final choice to follow carries visible cost in abandoning his human life. Internal contradiction works through his body remembering "a shape he'd forgotten" while his conscious mind stops asking why.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from dock labor through the scrimshaw's vibration to full transformation, with the island-as-cage revelation reweighting all prior imagery. Cost is legible in Elias leaving behind his human form and the dockworkers' silent knowledge, though the whale's philosophical declarations slightly dilute the visceral closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe glows to reveal truth, the scrimshaw fits "like a key," and the island's physical dissolution enables the final transformation. Setting actively constrains choice through the island's shrinking edges and the whale's call from the trench, though some descriptive phrases ("thick as regret") lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds from passive dock work through the scrimshaw's vibration to bodily transformation, with the island's dissolution as final stakes. The cost of leaving human form is visible, though the whale's arrival and Elias's transformation feel slightly predetermined rather than fought for.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cage/freedom reversal and "he hadn't become anything / He'd only remembered" reweight the entire premise without moralizing. The scrimshaw-as-key and island-as-cage work as concrete images that resist abstraction, though the whale's direct philosophical statements ("Freedom is not the absence of bonds") edge toward thesis articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in "salt-stiffened ropes biting into his palms like old grudges" and physical details like the scrimshaw warming against skin. However, register drift appears in elevated moments ("sublittoral fringe," "consensus reality") and the whale's articulated wisdom breaks voice consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid concrete imagery ("whalebone carving," "ribs ached to expand") with good momentum, but figurative density clusters heavily ("thick as regret," "heavier than crates," "impatient lover" in quick succession). Template structure appears in parallel "He didn't [X] / He [Y]" constructions and some abstract philosophy interrupts scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The human-to-whale transformation through stolen scrimshaw offers fresh specificity, and the island-as-cage revelation reframes the entire world. However, the transformation-as-remembering and freedom-through-bonds concepts echo familiar fantasy tropes without sufficient transformation through lived detail.</comment>
