<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's grief-driven motivation is embodied through concrete actions (painting vanished docks, burning paintings, jumping through the cave) with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—his need to preserve versus release. The final choice to enter "temporary eternity" is earned through accumulated pressure, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("intimately, achingly *known*") rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (painted shell, mirror's cracks, bioluminescent cave) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias chooses dissolution into the cave's eternal pause. Cost is visible in burning his paintings and the final submersion. The orientation anchors arrive late (~200 words) but serve the dreamlike accumulation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cave's stillness that "doesn't ripple" and water that "forgets to move" constrain Elias's choice by offering the only place where time can hold his mother's memory. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (bioluminescent pulse, metallic tang), though some descriptions veer ornamental ("jagged shadows like broken teeth").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through textural accumulation: from painting memories to entering the cave to final dissolution. The dominant stake—preserving connection with his mother—tightens when the pool reveals her image, forcing the choice between remaining in linear time or joining temporary eternity. Cost is legible in what he surrenders (his art, his life in the village).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete paradox of "temporary eternity"—the space between breaths where promises live without fading. The final image of endless sunsets in the floating shell offers a non-literal answer to grief's persistence. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit "he wasn't destroying / He was making room."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception (Elias notices rust-red ochre, spiral whorls, bioluminescent pulse). Some register elevation in peak moments ("intimately, achingly *known*") slightly exceeds the established texture. POV remains stable throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("jagged shadows like broken teeth," "the sound like waves retreating"). Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in middle sections ("Elias knelt... Elias exhaled... Elias paused").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief, art, and temporal paradox through the specific image of a painted seashell containing "impossible sunsets" offers fresh inflection on loss. The concept of "temporary eternity" as a physical space where time curls transforms the familiar grief narrative, though some elements (mystical cave, prophetic mother) edge toward familiar territory.</comment>
