<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's contradictory identity as "arsonist's daughter turned firefighter" drives genuine internal complexity, with her compassion toward her father creating authentic tension rather than simple rejection. The boy's wound provides immediate external pressure that tests her values, and her choice to heal with the same thread that holds her father's coin demonstrates layered motivation. Minor deduction for the village's whispered judgment remaining abstract rather than embodied in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the coin's transformation from father's talisman to healing tool creating a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (the thread darkened with blood). Orientation anchors solidly by ~120 words, and the boy's injury provides the necessary pressure point that forces Liora to enact her philosophy. The cost is legible in "All the best stories do" acknowledging scars as permanent markers, though the final "would she" feels slightly hedged rather than crystallized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and volcanic black sand constrain choices effectively—Liora must kneel at the edge, the jagged grains carry memory of fire, and the lagoon's water becomes the site of crisis with the bleeding boy. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("kelp-drift peace," "salt and scorched earth"), though some descriptions lean ornamental ("clouds rolled on, endless and unhurried").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The boy's wound creates immediate stakes that test Liora's commitment to healing over destruction, with her instant response ("on her feet before the sound faded") demonstrating agency. The conflict escalates from internal meditation to external crisis requiring action, with visible cost in the bloodied thread. The dominant stake of proving compassion can transform destruction is clear, though the village's opposition remains largely theoretical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of transformation through compassion emerges organically through the coin's journey from arsonist's pocket to firefighter's coat to healing tool. "All the best stories do" about scars resonates as earned wisdom from lived experience. The final image of running toward smoke while carrying "both flames now" offers a non-literal answer to whether destructive heritage can be transformed, though some passages edge toward explicit ("compassion wasn't the absence of fire").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Liora's perceptual signature is distinct—she notices textures ("jagged grain"), perceives in fire metaphors ("laughter, rough and crackling like dry kindling"), and maintains professional awareness ("firefighter's lore about pressure and time"). The dialogue between Liora and the boy carries subtext about accepting damage as identity. Minor voice drift in elevated passages ("migration of clouds rolled on, endless and unhurried") that doesn't match her practical focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong moments of concrete imagery ("fingers tracing the black sand," "coin's weight steady against her ribs") alternate with overwritten passages that slow momentum ("shadows drifting like kelp on an unseen tide"). Template cadence appears in the final section with repetitive "She would/The village would/The boy would" structures. The prose achieves clarity but occasionally sacrifices propulsion for lyrical effect, particularly in transitional passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The specific synthesis of arsonist's daughter becoming firefighter who heals with her father's coin offers a non-obvious take on inheritance and transformation. The obsidian lagoon as a space that "remembered heat" provides fresh environmental metaphor. The story commits to its premise without retreat, though it plays relatively safe within its chosen territory rather than taking bold structural risks.</comment>
