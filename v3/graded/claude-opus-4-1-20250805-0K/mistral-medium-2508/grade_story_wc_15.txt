I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rigorous rubric provided.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation crystallizes through embodied action—his sleepwalking as both literal movement and metaphorical weaving creates genuine complexity. The "haunting optimism of a man who had spent his life mending what others called lost" drives authentic choices. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract epiphany about the labyrinth-as-loom, though it's earned through prior action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the labyrinth transforms from maze to loom to door, with visible cost in Elias's "bones aching with the weight of the path he'd walked." The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraphs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting actively constrains and enables choices—"paths that doubled back on themselves, stairs that led to dead ends." The illustration plate functions as micro-setting that "pressed to the stone" transforms the environment. Sensory detail like "the scent of rusted iron where the water had kissed the red stone" filters through POV effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming ruin to reverence—escalates through the sleepwalking sequence where "the labyrinth *shifted*" (emphasis original), with paths unraveling and dead ends blooming. Cost manifests in physical toll and the foreclosure of return to the old wharf. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the weaving metaphor that governs action, not abstraction: "What was lost was never gone—only waiting to be named." The labyrinth-loom-door progression offers a non-literal answer to questions of transformation and persistence. The winged figure's migration from plate to stone embodies rather than states meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "a man of frayed edges" whose voice is "a rasp from years of whispering verses to the wind." Rhythmic control modulates effectively between lyric description and urgent transformation. The purposeful elision of exact mechanics during sleepwalking is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with moments like "the labyrinth had always been a place of broken rules," but several instances of abstract telling weaken momentum: "haunting optimism," "something yet unnamed." Some paraphrase loops appear ("The wharf was waiting" echoes earlier setup). Information density could be higher in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sleepwalking-as-weaving concept offers fresh synthesis—neither pure dream logic nor conscious craft. The transformation of illustration plate to living stone carving transcends typical magical realism. Specific details like "threading salt-worn ropes" ground the fantastical premise in lived experience.</comment>
