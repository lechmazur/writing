I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration where the passenger's burden is redistributed rather than resolved.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias demonstrates clear motivation through embodied expertise ("hands cradled the storm glass vial like a secret") and the passenger's unspoken grief creates genuine tension. The final choice to step off with burden "redistributed" rather than removed shows earned wisdom. Minor deduction for the passenger remaining somewhat abstract despite her central role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the passenger's transformation from "burdened" to having weight "recalibrated—not lighter, but better distributed" with visible cost in her "flinched" reaction to laughter. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through storm glass states, prism refractions, and silence manipulation. Deduction for slightly abstract stakes that could be more viscerally grounded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prism terrace functions as active setting that "fractured the dusk into a thousand quiet refractions" and enables the story's central mechanics of transforming sound and silence. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("vaulting hush so deep it hummed in the bones"). The gondola/canal setting constrains movement and creates the liminal transit space essential to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the passenger's journey from silence to exhaled release, with the storm glass darkening in "recognition" of her specific grief. The child's laughter creates a meaningful test that Elias must navigate. Cost is visible in her "shoulders unclenched" and the "faintest traceries of what had passed through" in the vial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete mechanics of teaching silence "how to comfort instead of accuse" and noise "how to move." The storm glass serves as a physical manifestation of emotional weather. The ending's image of the terrace humming "a vaulting hush that held everything and demanded nothing" offers resonant non-literal answer to handling grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elias's professional attention to silence gradients and the storm glass's states. Voice modulates effectively from meditative observation to sparse dialogue. The prose rhythm mirrors the gondola's drift. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("vaulting hush," "fluid logic") that slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("adjusted the brass dial on his wrist, monitoring noise levels not to measure sound, but to map its absence"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("angles too sharp for grief, too soft for resolve") and repetitive "somewhere" construction in closing. Template cadence appears briefly but doesn't pervade.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of gondola operator as silence technician with storm glass as emotional barometer offers fresh angle on grief processing. The concept of teaching silence "how to comfort instead of accuse" transforms expected consolation narrative. Risk-taking in the abstract treatment of the passenger pays off through specific physical details of the terrace's mechanics.</comment>
