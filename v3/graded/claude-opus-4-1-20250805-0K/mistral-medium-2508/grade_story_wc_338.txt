I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural** lens, as it builds through layered images and sensory details toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's methodical curiosity drives concrete micro-choices (overlaying films, tracking discrepancies, threading her own reel) with embodied tension ("breath fogging the glass plates"). The final renunciation of proof in favor of listening shows earned wisdom through accumulated observation, though her internal contradiction could be sharper in early beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Charged Poise as Elara discovers the tear marks time rather than space, with cost visible in her choice to "return to the surface with no proof." The accumulative structure coheres as sensory details (dripping ceiling, humming stones, flickering films) build toward the crystallized realization that "silence was a language," though the orientation takes slightly too long to anchor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The vault's sensory architecture constrains choices brilliantly—the henge must be "listened to" rather than seen, the frescoes "ripple like water" at certain frequencies, and the physical tear in the map becomes the story's organizing principle. The rain-scoured setting evolves from oppressive dampness to cleansing presence, with every detail filtered through Elara's professional lens as a map framer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through textural deepening as each film reveals new discrepancies (shadows pooling vs. climbing), culminating in Elara's recognition that the whispered chapel exists "between the seasons." The cost manifests in her acceptance of unmeasurable knowledge over Guild validation, though the stakes could tighten more explicitly in middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The central theme—measuring what cannot be charted—emerges organically through Elara's professional tension between Guild orthodoxy and henge wisdom. The final image of the map as "key" rather than "boundary" offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior cartographic metaphors, with the rain's transformation from scouring to cleansing particularly resonant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual signature as someone who measures "quiet spaces between what was recorded and what was remembered" remains consistent and distinctive. The prose modulates effectively from technical precision ("brass-framed lenses," "1923," "1989") to lyrical abstraction ("the echo of a door swinging open on hinges no one had oiled in centuries"), though occasional filter phrases slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The vault smelled of damp stone and old secrets" establishes setting, tone, and theme). Some metaphoric density in peak beats ("marrow of her bones," "ribs thrumming") approaches oversaturation but remains coherent, and the rhythm varies naturally between short declaratives and flowing observations.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography, film analysis, and acoustic archaeology creates an original investigative method for discovering temporal rather than spatial boundaries. The specific detail of comparing equinox footage across decades to find moments "between seasons" transforms the familiar lost-knowledge trope through lived professional expertise.</comment>
