<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with concrete sensory detail ("the violin's cold seeping into her bones," "breath fogging the air") and layered motivation between contract obligation and moral stance. The protagonist's gift creates genuine internal conflict acted out through micro-choices (touching the violin, reading coffee stains, ultimately destroying it). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "destiny already perforated" that doesn't fully embody the emotional state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change closure with visible cost—Elara destroys the violin and accepts being labeled a thief/madwoman. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and plant consciousness build toward the final crystallization. Strong causality from coffee-stain prophecy through plant urging to final choice. Minor deduction for slightly rushed transition from playing to destroying without showing the full weight of decision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively constrains choice through its glass walls, garden connection, and midnight deadline. Vivid sensory specificity ("velvet observatory hummed with the scent of crushed violets") filtered through Elara's professional lens. The wisteria and garden become active participants that shape the final action. The ice violin's physical properties (transparency, cold, fragility) directly enable both playing and destruction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from authentication task to moral choice about art's ownership, with clear cost (losing payment/freedom vs. enabling hoarding). The midnight deadline creates genuine pressure, and Elara's agency drives the decisive destruction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the violin plays itself and reveals Silas's voice. Slight deduction for not fully dramatizing what "buying her freedom" means concretely.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of propagation vs. ownership emerges organically through the ice violin's fate and the plants' urging. The final image of ice-vines breaking through the roof offers a non-literal answer about art's nature—it cannot be caged. Strong subtext in the plants' memory and the violin's frozen symphony. Minor deduction for slightly overt thematic statement in "some dreams were heavier than empires."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("midsummer sky," "Glissando Tundra," "mulberry ache"). POV remains stable with Elara's perceptual signature shaping what's noticed (fracture lines, plant thoughts). Strong free indirect style maintains psychic distance appropriately. The prose rhythm accelerates during the destruction scene. Minor repetition of "propagate" concept could be more varied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from POV lexicon ("perforated by choices not yet made"). Minor paraphrase loop around the propagation concept in paragraphs 5-6. The final image lands with strong specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic botanist with ice violin creates non-obvious stakes about art's ownership. The concept of frozen music that plants can propagate is genuinely inventive. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode and plant consciousness pays off. The transformation from authentication task to revolutionary act feels earned and specific to this world.</comment>
