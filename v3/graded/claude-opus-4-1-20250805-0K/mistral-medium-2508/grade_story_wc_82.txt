<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lantern maker's grief-driven transformation reads with embodied specificity—trembling fingers, the gem that "pulled at her skin, hungry." Her final letting go feels earned through accumulated loss (daughter's voice in glass, shadow detachment) with visible cost as she becomes "part of the recording."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist transforms into dream-stuff, allowing the isle to rise "into the place where dreams are kept." Cost is visceral—"Pain lanced up her arm...peeling back her skin"—and the closure reweights all prior imagery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating isle and glass basilica create atmospheric pressure through specific decay ("rotting heart") and impossible physics ("descending while ascending"). The tea garden's transformation from joy to "graveyard of origami cranes" constrains emotional movement, though some descriptive passages lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal grief to existential transformation as the gem "bit down" and the protagonist must choose dissolution. The isle's sinking-through-not-into creates persistent pressure, with meaningful deepening when she understands "the isle wasn't sinking. It was unfolding."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of grief that "unfolded itself in the dark" despite attempts to fold it small. The final transformation—becoming part of what she recorded—offers a non-literal answer about preservation through dissolution, with the cranes' metamorphosis charging the resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric control with distinctive perceptual signature ("facets catching the dying light like a breath held too long"). Compression and elision serve the accumulative mode, though occasional elevated diction ("basilica's spine") slightly strains the intimate register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("steam curled like unspoken promises between cupped hands") but suffers from density overload with figurative language in nearly every sentence. Some metaphor vehicles clash (architectural spine/organic breathing), and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief-as-physical-architecture with dream-recording technology feels fresh and inevitable. The impossible physics ("descending while ascending") and transformation of paper cranes into living dream-stuff demonstrate risk-taking that heightens stakes without sacrificing coherence.</comment>
