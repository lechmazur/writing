<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to redeem his great-grandfather drives concrete choices with embodied tension ("fingers trembled...not from the cold, but from the *knowing*"). The final renunciation—burning the journal—carries visible cost and forecloses the path to the Maw, though internal contradiction could deepen during the climactic glass-shattering moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds as Elias's discovery leads to testing the nail, which tears reality and forces his choice to destroy the evidence. Closure lands through Earned Stasis with visible cost (burning the journal, accepting the door stays closed), though the cost could be more viscerally felt in the final beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The weather station and storm create genuine pressure—the Maw's movement forces Elias's decision timing. The copper nail's physical properties ("hummed faintly...like a tuning fork") and the shattered glass constrain choices, though more tactical use of the station's specific spaces would strengthen integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal vindication to dimensional threshold crossing, with the nail's activation creating irreversible consequences. The pressure peak when "the glass shattered" and "the world snapped back" shows clear cost, though the final third could sustain higher tension through Elias's choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between opening dangerous doors and accepting closures—crystallized in "Some doors should stay closed. Others should never have been shut." The burning ritual and Liora's shifted demeanor embody the cost of knowledge without stating morals.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in "wind howled like a starving thing" and selective attention to atmospheric details befitting a map librarian. Some register elevation in stressed moments ("reversible exile," "suffocating reality") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Minor redundancies appear ("hollow" voice after stating "the Maw's gone" already conveys emptiness) and occasional overwriting in metaphors, but momentum sustains through the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of atmospheric tears as dimensional thresholds offers fresh speculation on historical disappearances. The specific synthesis of weather station protocols with maritime mystery, plus the nail as tuning fork for reality, creates non-obvious resonance.</comment>
