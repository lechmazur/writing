I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration where Liora's carved truth shatters the elders' system of dispersed guilt.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—carving forbidden truths into bone while the elders perform their ritual of dissolution. Her transformation from "innocently mischievous" poet to revolutionary carries embodied cost: "her fingers bleeding" as she carves. The internal contradiction between knowing the spire's lie and acting against it plays out through physical stakes, though some emotional specificity could deepen the personal cost beyond defiance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands powerfully as Liora's carved words shatter both the spire and the system of dispersed guilt: "every confession, every half-truth, every name they'd buried now twisting back upon them." The accumulative structure builds from individual transgression through systemic understanding to revolutionary action with clear cost—the spire's destruction and the elders' screams. The final image of carving truth "into the spire's remains, where the light would refract it forever" achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with undeniable consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canyon of bone towers constrains every choice—Liora must climb sideways "where the elders wouldn't look" to reach the thin bone where carving is possible. Setting functions as both obstacle and resource: "the fissure in the third tower, where the bone was thin enough to carve, and the echoes would carry her words like arrows." The bone's properties (grown from sins, humming with names) directly enable the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from private defiance to public confrontation, with the ritual's timing creating urgency. The dominant stake—whether truth or comfortable lies will prevail—tightens as Liora races to reach the carving spot before the ritual completes. Cost manifests physically ("fingers bleeding") and systemically (the spire shatters, the elders scream).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of refraction—how the spire "split the weight of guilt into shards so fine no one could grasp them." Liora's counter-truth that "The spire doesn't take your sin. It scatters it" offers a non-literal answer to questions of accountability. The final image of carving truth into the remains "where the light would refract it forever" transforms the mechanism of dispersal into one of permanent witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric intensity with controlled compression: "The canyon breathed before dawn, its walls of bone humming with the weight of unspoken names." POV remains tightly focused through Liora's perception, with selective attention to tactile details ("chalked with the dust of old carvings"). The rhythmic control during the climax—short, urgent sentences as she carves—heightens pressure without sacrificing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The towers were not built; they were grown, fed by the sins of the contrite, their marrow thick with confessions never spoken aloud." Some metaphorical density in early passages ("needle drawing thread from the sky") could be tighter, but the climactic sequence maintains clean propulsion. Information unfolds without loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of a canyon built from crystallized guilt where absolution works through dispersal rather than forgiveness offers genuine freshness. The transformation of religious ritual into revolutionary act through the specific mechanism of carved counter-truth feels earned and non-obvious. Risk-taking in the dense metaphorical system pays off through coherent world-logic.</comment>
