<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find "where unused love went to die" drives consistent choices through psychometry and film manipulation, with embodied tension in her breath catching and fingers trembling. The final renunciation (letting the dark have its say) carries visible cost as she releases both the search and the stored love. Interiority is concrete ("space between her ribs where she'd stored him") though some passages lean toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and film fragments build toward the resonant reconfiguration where Elara realizes the love wasn't unused but "waiting for the right hands." The closure lands with felt cost as she accepts his goodbye and turns off the projector, foreclosing the search. Orientation anchors (projection booth, Elara as crystal gazer) establish clearly within the first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The projection booth functions as both physical setting and temporal labyrinth where "every rusted bolt and cracked lens" becomes a doorway. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (ozone smell, floorboards vibrating, celluloid warming) and the film strips constrain Elara's search method. The setting enables the final choice when she must thread the film "one last time."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding the goodbye letters/unused love) tightens as Elara discovers the letters exist "in the flicker and the grain" rather than as physical objects, forcing her to engage differently with the films. The final renunciation carries cost as she releases her search, though middle escalation could be stronger under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central question of where love goes when unexpressed, answered non-literally as "waiting for the right hands to turn the reel." The recurring motif of light/dark ("where the light can't fade it," "letting the projector eat the words") accumulates meaning. The final realization that love was stored "between her ribs" reweights all prior searching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm ("hummed like a sleeping beast," "thick and golden, like honey left too long in the sun") and selective perception focused on tactile film details. The italicized remembered dialogue creates clean distinction between past and present. Some passages drift toward elevated register but remain within an imaginative crystal gazer's plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong figurative coherence ("thief of echoes," "labyrinth of time") with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph lengths. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("shape of a song waiting to be remembered") and some repetitive constructions around "where" that create mild template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of love stored in film strips rather than letters offers a fresh angle on lost correspondence, with the psychometry-through-celluloid providing unique access to memory. The synthesis of projection booth as temporal space feels earned. The ending's quiet acceptance rather than dramatic revelation takes a measured risk that mostly succeeds.</comment>
