I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through layered imagery, recurring motifs, and a final resonant reconfiguration rather than strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The beekeeper's seventeen-year silence creates a compelling constraint that shapes every interaction, particularly his wordless exchange with the ghosts. His internal consistency—from patient observation through the fractured glass to his final deliberate choice—earns the closure. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract handling of the ghosts' motivations, though their function as memory-pressure works.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from silence and stasis through ghostly visitation to regeneration, with the honeycomb as pivotal transformation object. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the wasteland's transformation and the bees' return demonstrate visible cost (his disappearance) and reward (renewal). The covenant's untangling provides conceptual weight, though the exact mechanics of transformation could be slightly clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of setting as active constraint—the wasteland's desolation shapes every choice, from the beekeeper's silence to the ghosts' arrival. The oasis transformation from skeletal hives to blooming thyme creates powerful before/after. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting, its fractured light becoming a lens for perception. Setting directly enables the closure's regenerative image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving/releasing the covenant—builds through accumulation rather than reversals, appropriate for the textural lens. The box opening represents meaningful deepening that changes knowledge and options. Cost is visible in the beekeeper's disappearance and the seventeen years of silence. Slight reduction for the ghosts' agency overshadowing the protagonist's at the pivotal moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of silence/speech, preservation/release, death/renewal without explicit moralizing. The final image of wind moving "like a breath—steady, sure, and finally free" offers resonant non-literal answer to questions of covenant and sacrifice. The bees remembering while not noticing creates layered meaning about continuity beyond individual presence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains lyrical consistency throughout, with controlled rhythm that mirrors the story's meditative pace. Perceptual signature strong—"learning to read the wind's warnings in the way light bent through its cracks." No dialogue preserves the silence motif effectively. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("covenant, tangled and half-forgotten") that slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("skeletal frames of wooden hives jutting from the sand like the ribs of buried giants"). Information density high—most sentences advance atmosphere, stakes, or meaning. Some figurative density in places ("whispers not sounds but pressures") and occasional abstract phrasing ("the weight of unspoken things") prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of environmental apocalypse with mystical covenant creates non-obvious angle. The seventeen-year silence as active choice rather than affliction transforms expected hermit tropes. The ghosts as covenant-bearers rather than tormentors offers genuine surprise. Risk-taking in the wordless protagonist and abstract ghost mechanics mostly succeeds.</comment>
