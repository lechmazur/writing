<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as the last historian collecting stories is clear and intensifies through his physical interaction with the tapestry, feeling the displacement "like a hook behind his ribs." His internal experience is richly embodied through sensory detail ("fingers light on the ladder rungs," pressing the tapestry to his cheek). The final choice to leave the silo carrying the tapestry shows earned progression, though the exact nature of his transformation could be more decisively rendered.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong pattern-building through recurring images (dragons, fire, displacement). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias leaves the silo with the tapestry "warm as a living thing," the world beginning to "remember how to turn." The cost is legible in his acceptance of displacement and abandonment of the silo's safety. Orientation anchors effectively by line 3 (Elias, silo library, post-apocalyptic setting).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The silo-library setting constrains and enables Elias's work brilliantly—the spiral shelves, the fireplace that holds half-burned diaries, the "cracked seal" through which objects drift. Sensory detail is exceptional ("air smelled of damp parchment and old smoke"). The environment directly shapes the final choice when "the silo sighed behind him, its metal skin singing." The tapestry functions as micro-setting that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving/understanding the world's lost stories—intensifies when the tapestry's dragons "move" and Elias feels "the displacement like a hook behind his ribs, tugging." This moment forecloses his option to remain a passive collector. The cost is visible when he leaves the silo's safety. Escalation could be stronger with more concrete opposition to his choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of displacement—both literal (the world knocked off its axis) and metaphorical (humanity's lost dreams). The tapestry's dragons that "pulled" rather than flew away offers a non-literal answer to what caused the Sundering. The final image of Elias walking with the warm tapestry while "somewhere, a dragon turned in its sleep" resonantly reweights all prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinctly literary with controlled lyricism ("bronze quiet hum," "grooves of a colossal phonograph"). The perceptual signature is consistently selective—Elias notices textures, temperatures, and resonances others might miss. Psychic distance modulates effectively from close interiority to wider observation. Minor weakness in occasional over-elevation ("ghost of heat") that slightly exceeds the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, plot). Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, especially in peak moments. Information unfolds efficiently without loops or scaffolding. Deduction for occasional figurative density that approaches overwriting ("bronze quiet hum" and similar constructions cluster without full payoff) and one instance of slight register elevation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of a post-apocalyptic librarian collecting stories "walls have heard" offers fresh specificity. The Sundering as a "trade" where "They took the dreams. We took the sky" transforms expected apocalypse tropes. The final synthesis of Elias becoming active rather than passive, carrying the warm tapestry into the world, feels earned and non-obvious. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens coherence.</comment>
