<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to map "the geography of healing" through absences drives concrete actions—following the thread, finding the locket, interpreting the prince's departure. Internal contradictions emerge when he realizes he writes obituaries not for loss but for finding, crystallizing in his decision to board the next ship as a "cartographer of the spaces between." The cost of understanding absence manifests in his physical burning sensation from the thread and his commitment to carry others' absences "like seeds."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer—thread, locket, garden—building toward Elias's realization that "the absent who needed their stories told." The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when he transforms from obituary writer to "cartographer of the spaces between," with cost visible in the burning thread and his acceptance of carrying absences. However, the prince's backstory remains vague ("He left because the sea promised answers") without concrete dramatization, and some causality feels asserted rather than earned through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The garden functions as active setting—the thread in damp earth, skeletal vines, the weeping willow's branches "dragging the ground like fingers tracing a wound." The locket buried in loam constrains Elias's search and charges his final understanding. Sensory details filter through his profession: "autumn's breath," the thread's warmth pulsing "like a heartbeat," creating atmosphere that mirrors the theme of absence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding absence to heal—progresses through Elias finding the thread, discovering the locket, and realizing the prince chose departure. However, escalation remains gentle without sharp reversals or mounting pressure; the discovery unfolds too smoothly. The cost emerges in Elias's commitment to board ships as a "cartographer," but this decision lacks immediate trade-offs or visible struggle in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of "obituaries for the living" and crystallizes in "some absences are explanations, not endings." The thread as compass, the smudged portrait background, and the garden that "held its breath" create layered meaning without explicit moralizing. The final image of wind moving through trees "long after the last ship had sailed" resonantly answers the central question about presence in absence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm—"its sails swallowing the horizon like a sigh"—and selective perception filtered through Elias's profession of listening for "the shape of absence." The prose modulates effectively between contemplative passages and active discovery. Minor weakness in occasional overwriting ("lonesome splendor") but perceptual signature remains distinct throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of excellence—"the city belonged to those who stayed—not by choice, but by the quiet weight of things unsaid"—with strong information density. However, some figurative language feels overwrought ("skeletal vines," "dragging the ground like fingers tracing a wound") and abstract statements occasionally replace concrete action ("mapping the geography of healing"). Template cadence appears in the final section with repeated "He would" constructions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of writing obituaries for the living offers genuine freshness, avoiding typical grief narratives. The specific synthesis of absence-as-presence through physical objects (thread, locket) that guide understanding feels earned. However, some elements feel familiar—the mysterious disappearance, the garden setting—without full transformation through specificity.</comment>
