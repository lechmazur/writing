I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory accumulation and pattern breaks, with the perfume scent serving as the decisive cadence shift that reweights understanding.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's "aromatically cautious" trait drives concrete choices throughout, and his transformation from feeding the Luminara with grief to walking away shows earned change with visible cost. The internal contradiction between protecting himself from scents and carrying his mother's vial creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient epiphany timing when he understands the flowers feed on tears.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias's understanding reprices his entire relationship with grief and the flowers, leading to decisive action (destroying lanterns, selling vial, leaving). The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build to the perfume's release triggering revelation. Cost is visible in abandoning his life's work and the Luminara dying without him. Slight deduction for the mechanically tidy resolution of selling the vial.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting with UV lights revealing hidden script creates atmospheric pressure and constrains the revelation to this specific space. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("breath of forgotten things," "skeletal ferns"). The Luminara's silver veins and UV-dependent nature directly shapes the plot. Deduction for some generic descriptors ("wet earth after rain") that could be more specific to this world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal grief to understanding a parasitic relationship, with the perfume serving as the key that transforms everything. The dominant stake (understanding his mother's gift) tightens when he realizes the flowers feed on his sorrow. Cost is legible in his decade of unknowing servitude and the choice to destroy his livelihood. Minor deduction for the slightly passive discovery rather than more active pursuit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of flowers feeding on grief - some relationships that seem nurturing are actually parasitic. The final image of Elias not flinching at new growth resonates as genuine healing. "Some smells are doors" works as both literal plot mechanism and thematic statement about memory and choice. Slight deduction for the somewhat explicit thematic statement in the final lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("The greenhouse hummed with the breath of forgotten things"). POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance and selective perception focused on light and scent. Free indirect style works well in the flashback. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("erosion" metaphor) that slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative language feels slightly forced ("blade" for scent, "erosion" for grief). Minor template cadence in "He [verb]" constructions mid-story. The opening and closing lines effectively frame the piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of botanical horror with grief exploration - flowers that literally feed on human sorrow is conceptually strong. The transformation of the sympathetic "tending mother's flowers" into parasitic feeding adds originality. The specific detail of UV light revealing hidden nature elevates beyond standard grief narratives. Slight deduction for familiar grief-processing arc despite the innovative premise.</comment>
