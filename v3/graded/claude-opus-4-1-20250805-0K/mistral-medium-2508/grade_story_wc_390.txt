<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The engineer's internal contradiction between logic and emotion drives authentic choices, particularly in the decision to turn the key knowing it will "unravel her from the inside out." Her transformation from human to "something less human, more ethereal" carries visible physical cost. The motivation is clear and embodied through concrete sensory details like "molars ache" and "bones vibrated."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the engineer becomes a living frequency to stabilize the artifact, with clear cost ("nerves rewriting themselves"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds toward the transformation. The piece teaches its sonic/vibrational logic early and pays it off through "forgiven by physics." Minor deduction for slight orientation delay on the artifact's nature.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina functions as both setting and constraint—its "disharmony" creates the cage that contains the artifact, and its thinning ice drives urgency. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("dust that glittered like crushed pearl"). The environment directly shapes the solution: using the marina's properties as "conduit instead of cage."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from ice thinning to the sphere threatening release to the engineer's bodily sacrifice. The dominant stake (preventing catastrophic resonance) tightens through her realization that she must become the harmony herself. Cost is unmistakable in her physical transformation, though the world-level threat could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central paradox of "sonic absolution"—that matching rather than erasing creates resolution. The final image of the engineer finding rest in a state "where logic and emotion were the same thing" offers a non-literal answer to the story's questions about sacrifice and protection. The "forgiven by physics" moment brilliantly merges spiritual and scientific frameworks.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in technical-poetic fusion ("language only she understood—low, mournful frequencies"). Voice modulates effectively under pressure, compressing during the transformation sequence. Minor instances of elevated diction ("fleshly," "subsonic whine") slightly strain the POV's established register but don't harm clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("sunset bled gold," "frequency could dissolve guilt like sugar in tea"). Some overwriting in metaphor density ("reverse lightning strike," "choir of ghosts") and occasional register drift ("fleshly" feels forced). The final third maintains momentum despite dense figurative language.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of sonic absolution as physical transformation rather than erasure offers a fresh angle. The synthesis of mystical (monks, cathedral) and technical (engineer, resonator) elements feels organic. The specific solution—becoming the harmony rather than silencing it—emerges naturally from established logic.</comment>
