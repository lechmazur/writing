<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's internal conflict between duty and self-preservation drives a credible final choice with visible cost ("her teeth stained violet"). The contradiction between knowing the seed will erase her mind yet choosing it anyway creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract treatment of villagers' forgetting, which could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora transforms from reality checker to living memory with explicit cost ("The island would forget her name / But it would keep her voice"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through seed→bite→revelation→transformation. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ridge as living memory constrains Liora's choice effectively, and the nightshade/seed imagery charges the final transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("seeds slept—tiny, iridescent things that pulsed like slow heartbeats"). Slightly generic treatment of the monsoon and village prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from protecting memory to sacrificing identity, with the seed forcing an irreversible trade-off. The revelation that "dreams weren't echoes...the island itself, trying to remember her" effectively reweights the conflict. Cost is visible in the transformation sequence and villagers' dawn discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the island-as-memory revelation without explicit moralizing. The final image of Liora as "the one who remembers" resonantly answers the central question about preserving collective memory. The piece earns its wisdom through concrete particulars rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "empirical whimsy" and "counter-memory, sharp enough to sever." Some register drift occurs with academic phrasing ("collective memory," "tapestry of collective memory") that occasionally breaks POV immersion. Voice maintains consistency through the transformation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("a taste like the first question ever asked"). Template cadence appears in the middle section ("She had spent years...," "She pocketed...," "She gasped...") creating mechanical rhythm. Some paraphrase loops around memory/forgetting concepts reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a reality checker who becomes the island's living memory offers fresh perspective on collective memory preservation. The specific synthesis of seeds that "rewrote the mind" with an island that remembers its inhabitants creates non-obvious resonance. Risk-taking in the lyrical transformation sequence heightens stakes.</comment>
