I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a final crystallization where Liora walks into the storm.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's internal contradiction between being "fault-tolerant" yet trembling at barometric shifts creates genuine complexity. Her final choice to walk into the storm rather than warn the others emerges from established character logic—she's lived "in the margins" where certainties sway. The fever-weakened state and the smudged illustration work as concrete manifestations of her internal uncertainty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Charged Poise as Liora steps into the storm, crystallizing her choice between warning others and accepting dissolution. The cost is legible in "The wind carried her name away before she could hear it." However, the middle section meanders through reflection without sufficient present-frame anchoring, and the actual storm's arrival feels somewhat abrupt despite the buildup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mountain station as "half-healed scar" and its "iron ribs groaning" establish immediate atmosphere. Sensory details like "ozone and old blood" and "wet stone and something greener, sharper" ground the piece. The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its smudged state mirrors Liora's uncertainty and charges the final image when left "where the lantern's glow could find it."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to warn about the storm—builds through accumulation rather than reversals. Pressure coheres when "the storm wouldn't break at dawn. It would break *now*." The cost becomes visible when she chooses silence and dissolution over certainty, though the middle section could tighten the pressure more consistently.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of living "in the margins, where the weight of what she *didn't* say could never capsize the world" emerges through concrete details. The monk's hood plant "that thrived in the cracks between certainty and poison" creates thematic resonance. The ending achieves complexity—"Some truths were only visible from the margins"—though occasional abstract philosophizing ("truths were heavy things to swallow") weakens impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical density with selective perception: "The station's radio crackled, a voice from the lowland observatory asking for her forecast." The metaphorical register fits an oracle figure, and syntactic variety supports the accumulative mode. Perceptual signature is strong—she notices barometric pressure, wind shifts, and the smell of "ozone and old blood."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of excellence: "The mountain weather station clung to the ridge like a half-healed scar." However, abstract philosophizing creates density issues: "truths were heavy things to swallow, and heavier still to regurgitate" feels overwrought. Some metaphors strain ("the weight in her ribs dissolved like salt in water"), and occasional template constructions appear ("She could... Or she could...").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fault-tolerant oracle who chooses dissolution over false certainty offers a fresh angle. The botanical illustration as a smudged study of poisonous monk's hood creates original symbolic texture. The ending's ambiguity—whether she dies or transforms—resists tidy resolution while maintaining coherence.</comment>
