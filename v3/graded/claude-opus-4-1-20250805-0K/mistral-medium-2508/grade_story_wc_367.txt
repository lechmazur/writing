<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's contradictory nature—laughing weapon-wielder who both guides and threatens—creates genuine tension through embodied details like "fingers that knew the weight of shadows." The prophetic utterance emerging accidentally shows loss of control under pressure. Her final smile while "counting the hours until she'd climb again" demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost in her isolation from the village.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (light behavior, shadow responses) building toward Earned Stasis—Liora's acceptance of eternal duty with isolation as cost. The cyclical structure ("climb again") reinforces this reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, Liora, ritual) establish clearly by ~100 words. Cost appears in her severed connection to villagers who "didn't call her anything."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse's emerald glass and impossible light physics ("refracted—not outward, but inward") constrain Liora's ritual choices. Sensory detail filters through her professional awareness: "salt-worn stone," "ozone and old promises." The setting actively shapes action through the wick's specific adjustments affecting shadow-beings.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine duty to preventing catastrophic dawn ("The next sunrise will be the last you recognize"). The shadow-being's appearance forces Liora's decisive "You can't have it" stance. Cost manifests in her permanent isolation—villagers fear her, yet she must continue. The tension between protecting and being shunned creates authentic pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of necessary isolation—Liora saves those who fear her. The recurring light/shadow interplay and "bargain" motif avoid explicit moralizing. Her laughter as "weapon" rather than joy resonates without explanation. The final image of shadows that "listened, and waited, and dreamed" leaves the cyclical burden unresolved with proper ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm: "pulsed like a slow heartbeat," "star-choked sky." POV stays firmly with Liora, filtering observations through her storm-herald perspective. Some filter phrases ("She could feel") occasionally dull immediacy. Dialogue absence works given her isolation, though internal texture could vary more under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong atmospheric density with phrases like "light that wasn't quite light" and "teeth of time itself." Information density high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some repetitive structures appear ("She [verb]" patterns in middle section). Final image of walking "toward the village, her hands still warm" provides clean propulsion despite minor scaffolding elsewhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse-keeper-as-cosmic-guardian premise transforms familiar archetypes through specific details: light that bends inward, shadows as entities seeking dawn. Liora's prophetic accident and laughter-as-weapon feel fresh. The "print newspaper" temporal marker and emerald lighthouse create memorable specificity beyond generic fantasy.</comment>
