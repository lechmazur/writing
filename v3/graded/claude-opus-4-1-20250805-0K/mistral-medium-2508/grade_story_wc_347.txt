<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora's thirteen-year burden and moral complexity around guiding travelers despite prohibition creates genuine internal conflict. The moment she breaks her lifetime of refusing pleas to help the dying girl demonstrates earned character change under pressure. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("who had spent a lifetime refusing pleas") rather than fully embodied contradiction in the pivotal moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Liora's shift from isolation to active guidance reweights the orchard's curse and labyrinth's purpose. The blueprint discovery causally enables her secret path-marking system, and the final image of "a traveler walked free" while mechanical birds freeze crystallizes her choice's cost and meaning. Slight deduction for the cost being more implied than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cursed orchard, mechanical birds, and labyrinth create a cohesive fantastical setting that directly constrains Liora's choices. The frost deadline and birds' patrol patterns shape her tactics, while the safe tree's nuts become tools for subversion. The setting's dual nature—originally meant to guide, now corrupted to trap—enriches the thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake of whether to help travelers intensifies through the dying girl's arrival, forcing Liora from passive knowledge-holder to active guide. The frost deadline creates time pressure, though the escalation relies more on accumulation of detail than dramatic reversals. Cost is present but understated—Liora's risk in defying the system could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of corrupted systems versus individual moral action emerges organically through the labyrinth's transformation from guide to trap. The final image of mechanical birds frozen while a traveler walks free offers a non-literal answer about human agency versus automated control. Strong subtext in Liora's careful impressions that guide without touching stone directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with selective perception reflecting Liora's years of careful observation ("the exact moment their joints stiffened"). Voice modulates effectively from clinical precision about the orchard's dangers to urgency when the girl arrives. Some filter phrases ("she knew this because") slightly dull immediacy in places.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "impression" that builds meaning. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional paraphrase loops ("Someone had built the labyrinth to guide, not to trap" restates earlier material) and some filter-verb clusters that reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a corrupted guidance system transformed into a trap offers fresh perspective on labyrinth mythology. The mechanical birds as automated guardians and the nuts-as-breadcrumbs system show inventive world-building. The transformation of traditional helper-figure into secretive saboteur adds originality, though some elements feel familiar from fairy tale tradition.</comment>
