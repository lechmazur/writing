I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern rather than causal progression, culminating in Liora's transformation from ferry guide to vigil keeper.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's internal contradiction between duty and staying crystallizes effectively through embodied details like the punch's weight and the star imprint on her palm. The final renunciation—letting the punch arc into the shallows—carries visible cost as she forecloses her ferryman identity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("the courage that waits") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Earned Stasis as Liora releases the punch and joins the vigil keepers, foreclosing her ferryman path with visible cost. The accumulative texture coheres through water/twilight/threshold imagery building to "the most important crossings are the ones you don't make." Orientation anchors clearly (Liora, ridgeway, after duty ends). Slight deduction for cost being more conceptual than visceral in places.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ridgeway as liminal space between land and water effectively constrains choice—Liora must either return to ferrying or join the vigil. Sensory details like "damp earth," "salt and damp wool," and the "soft plink" ground the atmosphere. The punch and fire serve as micro-settings that shape action. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("twilight deepening like a held note").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to continue forward motion or embrace staying—tightens through Liora's encounter with the vigil keeper and culminates in releasing the punch. The "unused courage" in staying versus going creates genuine tension. Cost becomes visible when she relinquishes her ferryman tool. Escalation could be sharper; the middle section meanders slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central paradox that "the most important crossings are the ones you don't make," reweighting the entire ferryman mythology. The star stamps shift from marking progress to marking pause. The vigil fires and their keepers embody the theme without stating it directly until earned through scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with purposeful compression ("the ridge was a place of indirect routes"). Perceptual signature evident in water/navigation metaphors fitting Liora's ferryman background. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("You've come back"/"I never left"). Some register elevation in places ("metronome through the twilight") slightly exceeds the established baseline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("lantern swinging like a metronome") and rhythm variation supports the meditative pace. Information density generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("twilight deepening like a held note"), some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete, and minor redundancy in the threshold/crossing imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The inversion of the ferryman archetype—valorizing staying over crossing—offers genuine freshness. The "unused courage" residing in pause rather than action transforms familiar material. The vigil keeper community as alternative to forward motion feels earned and specific. Slight deduction for relying on somewhat familiar liminal space imagery.</comment>
