<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation builds from personal wound (his own closed file) through concrete discovery (the button) to active choice (sending the package, opening Maria's file). His internal contradiction between archival detachment and emotional investment manifests through physical habits ("exhaled through his nose") and embodied perception. The final choice to intervene costs him professional distance, earned through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: density builds through file details, button discovery, research revelation, culminating in Elias's shift from passive archivist to active intervener. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when he opens Maria's file "scanning for gaps," transforming his role with visible cost (abandoning detachment). The pattern of "small things...magnified in the retelling" pays off through his action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The file room's sensory details ("yellowed paper," "sour tang") establish atmosphere while the button functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—Elias must research it, leading to his intervention. Setting details filter through his professional lens ("manila and staples," "bureaucratic silt"). The button's physical specificity ("tarnished brass," "shank bent") charges the final image of searching for "clues waiting in the dust."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether forgotten foster children can claim meaningful connection. Pressure builds through accumulation—button discovery, research revelation, Elias's decision to send package—each narrowing his professional distance. The cost manifests when he abandons archival neutrality to become an active participant, "scanning for gaps" in Maria's file.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the button as "stubborn insistence on connection," files as "lives reduced to manila and staples." The final image of Elias searching Maria's file for "gaps, unspoken yearnings" offers a non-literal answer about how kindness survives through small acts. No moralizing; the piece trusts its accumulation of specific details.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices through an archivist's lens ("spines of archives," "dust patterns like fallen snow"). Voice modulates from clinical observation to emotional engagement without losing consistency. Free indirect style clean throughout ("No one had told him happiness was something you had to dig for").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Information density high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Some filter verb clustering ("he thought," "he imagined") in middle section slightly dulls immediacy. Rhythm varies naturally between longer reflective sentences and shorter declarative moments. The prose avoids loops but occasionally leans on abstraction ("forgotten lives pressed too hard").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise of an archivist discovering meaning in foster files avoids pure template through specific details (the button's military history, the grandmother's shaky signature). The transformation of Elias from passive observer to active participant offers a non-obvious angle on institutional care. Some safety in the resolution's optimism prevents higher scoring.</comment>
