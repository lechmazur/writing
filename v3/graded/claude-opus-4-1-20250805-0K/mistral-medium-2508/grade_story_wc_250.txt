<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guardian's silent, patient presence and the boy's internal struggle create authentic tension through embodied details like "hands trembled when he tied his fishing line." The final choice to leave the crumpled note shows meaningful change earned through the guardian's intervention, with visible cost in his relationship with his father.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout as patterns of light and dark build toward the boy's emotional release and the father's parallel discovery of the mirror. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—the boy's stance shifts from shame to understanding that "darkness wasn't the absence of stars—it was the space that let them shine," with felt cost in their unresolved separation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt dock and canal create atmospheric pressure through selective detail: "wooden planks slick as the canal's breath fogged the air." The dental mirror and shutters function as micro-setting that constrains choice and enables the guardian's wordless teaching, charging the final image of stars in reflection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on the boy's shame and severed connection with his father, signaled early through "carried his father's silence like a second skin." The guardian's light-weaving escalates from simple reflection to complex patterns that reframe the boy's understanding, though the resolution relies somewhat on the guardian's mysterious abilities rather than the boy's agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of stars needing darkness to shine, avoiding explicit moralizing. The dental mirror's journey from guardian to father creates resonance without explanation, and the final line "Empathy didn't need words" crystallizes the theme through demonstrated action rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception: "shadows pooled between the boats like forgotten promises." The guardian's silence and the boy's sparse dialogue carry authentic subtext, though some phrases like "spiralingly calm" feel slightly forced rather than organic to the POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery, but suffers from occasional overwriting: "shadows pooled between the boats like forgotten promises" and "spiralingly calm" feel ornamental. The extended coda after the natural ending dilutes momentum, though line-level clarity remains strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of wordless empathy through light-weaving offers a fresh angle on healing fractured relationships. The guardian figure avoids cliché through her specific tools and methods, though the resolution's reliance on quasi-magical intervention reduces the risk-taking that might elevate originality further.</comment>
