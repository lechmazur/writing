I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and metaphorical transformation rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to transform war's pain into beauty is embodied through concrete actions (pressing postcard to chest, singing to ghosts, eating the manual). Her three-hundred-year insomnia creates genuine exhaustion that drives choices. The soldier ghost interaction reveals character through contrasting interpretations of her work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "The Alchemy of Staying" - the poet sealing herself in the cocoon with visible cost (forgetting to title, but the wind supplies it). The accumulative structure coheres through recurring transformation imagery. Orientation is deliberately mythic but "who" remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The shell setting actively constrains and enables - its acoustic properties bend sound "into something almost holy," its walls record history, its mouth opens to the sea. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (jellyfish like "slow applause," taste of paper "like hope"). The helmet transforming to coral exemplifies environment participating in the story's alchemy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from personal exhaustion to ghostly confrontation to new war's drums, each demanding greater transformation. The poet's response intensifies from whispers to singing louder to eating the manual. Cost is visible in the three-hundred-year toll and final cocooning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of transformation - weapons to petals, ghost to kelp, rifles to poppies. The ending reweights everything as "The Alchemy of Staying" without stating a moral. Subtext operates throughout (jellyfish applause, reef-shadow joy) creating resonance beyond plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled compression ("shyly unstoppable, the way roots split stone"). Perceptual signature is distinct - everything filtered through poet's transformative lens. Dialogue between poet and ghost carries subtext about art's purpose. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("bones humming with the weight of unsaid verses"). Some figurative density in places but pattern-taught and purposeful. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. Minor repetition of "she" openings in middle section prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of war poetry, biological transformation, and temporal persistence. "Photosynthesize pain into beauty" is fresh and specific. The manual-eating gesture and wind-as-title-giver show genuine ingenuity. Risk-taking in the mythic-lyrical mode heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
