<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal conflict between preserving and releasing memory manifests through concrete actions—nailing photographs, lighting them, letting the bottle sink. The final transformation from warden to son is earned through accumulated gestures, though some emotional transitions ("for the first time, he wanted to feed it") could use more embodied grounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with photographs building density toward the resonant reconfiguration where Elias shifts from guarding against the past to letting it breathe. The cost is legible in "reaching not to pull him under, but to lift" and his changed role from warden to son, though the middle section could tighten the pressure-to-release arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The reservoir and ridgeway constrain every choice—photographs can only be nailed to skeletal trees, the church steeple breaks the surface at a specific water level. Sensory details like "damp stone and the faint, cloying sweetness" are POV-filtered through Elias's twenty-year vigil, and the setting actively shapes the ritual's possibilities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as photographs shift from fragments of loss to bridges of connection, culminating in the burning ritual. The dominant stake—whether to preserve or release the drowned past—tightens through each image, though the middle beat where he "wanted to feed it" could show more resistance before yielding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of drowning from destructive force to generative current—"memory isn't a weight, but a current." The final image of the reservoir learning to give resonates without stating a moral, and the shift from warden to son reweights all prior vigilance as incomplete mourning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through Elias's twenty-year practice—"the waterline receded just enough," "copper pipes still as the reservoir's buried bones." Rhythm modulates from stillness through ritual action to release, though a few phrases like "forgiveness neither of them had ever voiced" drift toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong imagistic precision in "church steeple broke the surface like a broken finger" and controlled rhythm throughout. However, abstract phrases like "the meaning they'd never let themselves share" and some template constructions ("One by one, he lit...") create minor momentum drags that don't quite reach the closure unit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The reversal of drowning into breathing/lifting transforms the flood narrative through specific ritual action. The synthesis of loss and recovery through photographs-as-bridge offers a non-obvious angle, though the "memory as current" metaphor edges toward familiar territory in the denouement.</comment>
