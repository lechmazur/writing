<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's internal conflict between professional rivalry and genuine understanding drives meaningful change, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("smirk until now," carrying both skepticism and awakening). The transformation from dismissing "kintsugi intentions" as sentimental to embodying that very principle shows earned causality with visible cost—risking death for understanding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure as Liora learns to "carry the weight" differently through transmutation of self. The coin-to-crucible-to-vial progression creates causal linkage, though the final workshop scene slightly dilutes focus. Cost is legible in accepting Veyra's path despite mortal risk ("reduce her to ash").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The foundry's "iron ribs groaned" and "rain-washed walls weeping rust" create vivid atmosphere that mirrors internal state. The crucible constrains choice (feed the coin or abandon the search), and sensory details filter through alchemist's perception ("factually mystical," temperature shifts). Setting actively participates in the transformation sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from finding a clue to risking death for understanding, with the coin's heat "crawling up her wrist" forcing commitment. The dominant stake—understanding versus safety—tightens when Liora feeds the coin despite knowing "the backlash would reduce her to ash." Agency drives the choice to complete Veyra's experiment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the alchemy metaphor: "mending broken things with gold, not to hide the cracks, but to make them part of the strength." The final image of learning "which cracks were meant to stay" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through the vial's "luminous regret" and weight-as-burden becoming weight-as-balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct alchemist voice with controlled lexicon ("crucible," "retort," "transmutation") and rhythmic modulation under pressure. The perceptual signature shows selective attention to chemical processes and transformative states. Minor dialogue ("You're afraid of the weight") carries subtext effectively, though limited dialogue presence prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong verb choices ("guttered," "scorched," "gilded"). Information density high in key passages. However, some paraphrase loops appear ("carry the weight differently"/"learned to carry it") and the extended denouement creates mild momentum drag after the primary closure moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of alchemy and emotional transformation through the specific "kintsugi intentions" concept, avoiding generic self-discovery. The rival-becomes-guide arc transforms familiar material through concrete details (zodiac coin, crucible ritual). Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
