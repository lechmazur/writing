<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his decade-long pursuit of truth, with concrete embodied tension in his pulse betraying his "emotionally rational" demeanor. The choice to photograph rather than flee shows values hierarchy under pressure. Minor deduction for Callahan's somewhat stock righteousness and the slightly convenient "they know you have it" message timing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal lens with clear closure: Elias reveals the parallel documents that prove the pattern of lies, fundamentally altering the power dynamic with visible cost (police approaching, career at risk). The "Some things couldn't be buried twice" crystallizes the irreversible change. Minor deduction for the slightly rushed final escape sequence that could use one more beat of consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The decaying railway station works as both literal setting and thematic mirror ("ivy strangled the iron bones"). Spatial choreography is clear, and the rosebush's final petal frames the timeframe meaningfully. The setting constrains choices (no escape routes mentioned until the shadow exit) though the final escape path feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from discovery to confrontation to revelation, with Elias's choice to reveal the parallel documents rather than flee showing agency under pressure. The cost is legible (career, safety, Church's pursuit). Slight deduction as Callahan's physical lunge feels abrupt after verbal sparring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "noble lies" theme emerges organically through the ledger's true purpose and Callahan's defense of protecting faith. The parallel documents create a resonant pattern from "gilded B to backroom handshake." The rosebush's decay mirrors truth's emergence, and the final "honest" station reweights the entire piece without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct academic voice for Elias with controlled interiority and selective perception (focusing on the illuminated B's craftsmanship). Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("Truth isn't something you bury"). Deduction for Callahan's slightly generic ecclesiastical register and the convenience of his radio crackling at the perfect moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("ivy strangled the iron bones," "light as a promise, heavy as a key"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("thick as mildew," "smooth as confession booth's curtain") and minor redundancy in describing the B twice. The "emotionally rational as ever" feels like a prompt echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The historian-as-detective angle and the ledger-not-hymnal reveal offer fresh takes on Church corruption. The parallel documents spanning centuries is a strong conceptual move. Loses points for the somewhat familiar confrontation structure and Callahan's stock defender-of-faith role.</comment>
