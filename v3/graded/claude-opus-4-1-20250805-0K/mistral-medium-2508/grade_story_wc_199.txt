<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation through seed-sorting as sacred duty drives meaningful transformation from sorter to grove-tender, with embodied details like tucking the moonstone "into the hollow of her cheek." The transformation carries visible cost ("skin was dappled with bark, her fingers tipped with thorns") though some transitions feel slightly rushed. Internal conflict between order and recognition of readiness plays out through concrete actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught transformation ("The transformed remember. You are the key's keeper now") building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora becomes part tree, part human. The closure lands with visible cost—her physical transformation and the arbor's dissolution into saplings she must now tend. Minor orientation wobble with the floating arbor's spatial logic but recovers through consistent world-rules.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ashen arbor functions as active setting that constrains and enables choices—its floating nature, silver-veined bark, and root-ladder all directly shape Liora's actions. Vivid sensory work ("warm as breath," "hummed loudest") filtered through Liora's seed-sorter perception. The arbor's transformation into grove directly charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: moonstone discovery → arbor's response → monuments dissolving → climbing to sapling → physical transformation. Each stage forecloses return with visible cost (monuments crumble, arbor vanishes). The protagonist's agency drives each choice though the middle section's monument descriptions slightly dilute momentum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of sorting seeds by "stories they carried" rather than size, culminating in "recognizing which stories were ready to take root." The transformation motif (monuments dissolving back to their essence, Liora's physical change) avoids abstraction through specific imagery. Final image of Liora sorting saplings resonantly reweights the opening without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct mythic voice with controlled diction ("the hush, the breath between") and consistent POV that filters perception through Liora's seed-sorter lens. Some elevated register moments ("prophecy tangled like vines") occasionally strain but remain within the established mythic mode. Strong perceptual signature in how she reads with fingertips and sorts by sound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic variation and purposeful imagery, though occasional density issues appear ("floating islands, each one a fragment of a world that had been or would be"). Some filter-verb clustering in middle sections ("She prodded," "She tucked," "She knelt") reduces immediacy. Information density high with most lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed-sorting with mythic transformation creates non-obvious angle on change/readiness themes. The specific detail of sorting seeds by their songs and stories, combined with the floating arbor and monument-building, avoids template fantasy. Risk-taking in the physical transformation and arbor dissolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
