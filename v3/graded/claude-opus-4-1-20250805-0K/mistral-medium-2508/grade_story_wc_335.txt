I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where pressure builds through layered imagery (shadows, mirrors, tea leaves) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration - Kael's initiation into a practice where doors/shadows are both threats and thresholds.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied characterization with Elspeth's backwards-walking habit and Kael's trembling hands revealing internal states. The mentorship dynamic creates genuine pressure through "combative tenderness" - love that doesn't flinch from teeth. Minor deduction for slight emotional summary in "though the words tasted like a lie" rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Kael learns to bind shadows and annotate thresholds, with visible cost in "fingers still smudged with tea and something older." The accumulative lens holds as tea leaves, shadows, and mirrors layer into a coherent system. Orientation anchors (library, afternoon, two characters) establish cleanly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The library setting actively constrains through "angles Elspeth had spent decades perfecting" that trap the shadow. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful - wax smell, sagging shelves, shadow rippling like water. The shadow-as-door and geometry of the room directly shape the climactic binding scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from reading tea leaves to binding an active shadow-door that "lunged upward." The pressure coheres through accumulation - from nervous tea-reading to active annotation that makes Kael's "fingers still smudged with tea and something older." Cost is visible in the transformation and what's ahead: "Now you learn the cost of coming back."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concept of "reversible exile" - every text a door, every reader a threshold. The final image of waiting "for the next shadow to knock" resonates without moralizing, suggesting cycles of teaching and danger. "Lies are where the interesting truths hide" deepens through action as Kael learns to read patterns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voices with Elspeth's "kind of quiet that makes people lean in" versus Kael's tentative questioning. The perceptual signature shows in details like counting spines "as if counting the ribs of a sleeping beast." Minor voice convergence in some dialogue exchanges keeps this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong images like "memories that had outlived their tellers" and the shadow "coiled like a spring." Some filter verbs ("she thought") and occasional redundancy ("deliberate slowness" could be just "deliberately"). The paraphrase of "reversible paths" after establishing the concept creates minor drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mentorship story with supernatural binding creates originality. The specific detail of walking backwards when nervous and tea-leaf geometry as magical annotation feels inventive. The shadow-as-door concept transforms the haunted library trope, though the apprentice-learning-dangerous-art frame is somewhat familiar.</comment>
