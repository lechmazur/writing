I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through sensory and emotional density toward a resonant reconfiguration where silence and music merge.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation crystallizes through embodied grief (salt in veins, bleeding fingers) and contradictory impulses—honoring her mentor while defying the storm's silence. The choice to "sail back into the storm, not to escape it, but to play it" shows earned agency with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstraction in the middle sections ("raw, unshaken marvel") that briefly dilutes the concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Liora stepping into the storm to "raise" the Capriccio through song, proving silence and music "had been the same thing all along." The heat-map cipher drives causality from emotion to frequency to breakthrough. Cost is legible in bleeding fingers and the choice to return to danger. Slight deduction for the abstract phrasing of the central revelation lacking one more concrete image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory and frozen sound create atmospheric pressure that constrains action—Liora must reverse-engineer the heat-map to "melt" the frozen air. Setting actively shapes the solution through the piano's physical presence and the glass that ultimately sings. Some middle passages lose specificity ("frozen air itself") where more tactile detail would strengthen.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: silence → failed piano strike → heat-map discovery → bleeding fingers → winterglass singing → world listening. Each attempt deepens the stakes from personal grief to cosmic transformation. The "storm welcomed her like an old collaborator" shows earned resolution with clear cost in returning to danger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the paradox that "silence isn't empty; it's a language no one had learned to speak." The ending reweights the opening tomb/cathedral imagery when the conservatory transforms from containing absence to birthing new sound. The revelation that silence and music are "the same thing all along" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("cathedral of sound...tomb of winterglass") and selective perception focused on vibration, texture, temperature. Some register elevation in peak moments ("raw, unshaken marvel") slightly strains the established voice. The perceptual signature of a musician feeling sound through scars and salt is compelling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and information density in most passages. However, abstract phrases like "raw, unshaken marvel" and "fractured harmonies" in peak beats reduce clarity. Minor paraphrase loop with "She wasn't translating silence into music. / She was proving they'd been the same thing all along" restates rather than advances. Template cadence appears briefly ("She struck...She pressed...She exhaled").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of frozen sound that must be melted through emotional heat-mapping is genuinely fresh. The synthesis of grief, physics, and music into a coherent system where emotions have frequencies feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the non-literal resolution (sailing into storm to play it) heightens stakes while maintaining clarity. Transforms the shipwreck survivor trope through specific musical logic.</comment>
