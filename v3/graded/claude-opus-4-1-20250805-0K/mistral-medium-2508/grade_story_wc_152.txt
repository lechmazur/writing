<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve truth through embroidery is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like "his fingers tracing constellations only he could name." The internal contradiction between disguising wisdom as foolishness while broadcasting truth creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the courier's underdeveloped presence and some abstract phrasing around "adjacent possibilities" that lacks full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the climactic broadcast. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias sacrifices himself to scatter truth across the city, with visible cost in "the observatory's dome shattered outward." The orientation is clear (observatory, Elias, autumn evening), and the "seeds scattered" image reweights the opening's isolation. Deduction for some causality softness around how exactly the telescope/flame mechanism works.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory against autumn sky creates immediate atmosphere, with sensory details like "cloak smelling of damp earth and gunpowder." The eternal flame functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—Elias must protect it while using it to broadcast. The setting actively shapes the climax through the telescope-flame synchronization. Minor deduction for some generic elements like "autumn dark."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving truth against censorship—is signaled early with "stars too honest for public consumption." Pressure escalates from the courier's warning through to the enforcers' arrival, forcing Elias's sacrificial broadcast. The cost is legible in the dome shattering and Elias's implied capture/death. Deduction for the vague "adjacent possibilities" mechanism that softens the middle escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between the Council's "unified narrative" and Elias's scattered truth-seeds. The final image of embroidery "scattered across the city like seeds" offers a non-literal answer about how truth persists through sacrifice. The eternal flame as both illegal object and voice creates layered meaning. Minor deduction for one instance of thematic echo in "stories stop everything."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice with poetic compression ("stood like a bruise") and controlled rhythm that accelerates toward climax. The perceptual signature shows in unique observations like "each tick a path not taken." Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("You're the one who listens"). Deduction for some register elevation that strains POV credibility ("adjacent possibilities," "unified narrative").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong opening line and resonant closure with "The stars were singing." Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("adjacent possibilities," "echoed silence") and mild overwriting in metaphors like "threaded a silver needle through the fabric of the cosmos" reduce clarity. Some filter-verb clustering around "Elias smiled," "Elias exhaled."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The galaxy-chart embroiderer concept offers a fresh angle on resistance through art. The synthesis of embroidery, astronomy, and political resistance feels specific and earned. The transformation of the observatory into a broadcast mechanism shows genuine ingenuity. Slight deduction for familiar resistance-against-authoritarian-regime framework, though the execution elevates it.</comment>
