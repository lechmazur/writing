<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses—seeking answers while fearing their absence—act simultaneously throughout, particularly in "He didn't fear the dark. He feared the explanations that wouldn't come." The renunciation of understanding at closure carries visible cost through burning his father's notes and choosing to collect silence instead.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through sensory details and psychometric fragments toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts "the shape of [answer's] absence." Cost is legible in the burned notes and the shift from collecting petrichor to collecting silence, though the physical lagoon sequence could strengthen causal linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The limestone cliffs, subterranean lagoon, and abandoned factory create atmospheric pressure, with the compass literally burning against Elias's palm as constraint. However, the environment doesn't sufficiently alter tactics or force specific choices beyond serving as backdrop for revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure—the compass heating, water reversing, father's voice emerging—toward Elias's choice to "let his hand drop." The cost manifests in burning twenty years of notes, though the lagoon sequence itself lacks physical stakes or resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The final image of collecting silence instead of petrichor brilliantly reweights the opening's significance, while "the hinge won't hold" transforms from cryptic warning to acceptance of unanswerable questions. Theme emerges organically through concrete details without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "the way a held object could whisper its past if you were quiet enough" and controlled rhythm throughout. The POV maintains consistent psychometric sensitivity, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("the shape of its absence") slightly outside Elias's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly "water rushed upward in a reverse waterfall." Minor template cadence in repeated "He [verb]" constructions and slight register drift in philosophical passages, but no artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The psychometry concept offers fresh angle on mystery/exploration, and the inversion of seeking "the lack of" an answer shows originality. However, the abandoned factory/cave exploration framework follows familiar patterns without sufficient transformation through lived detail.</comment>
