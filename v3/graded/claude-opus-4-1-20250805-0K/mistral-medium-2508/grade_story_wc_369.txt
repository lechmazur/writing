I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and metaphorical density toward a resonant reconfiguration about how sorrow is absorbed and transformed.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's character emerges through embodied actions—hands that patch walls with "whispered apologies," that don't tremble when dismantling grief. His understanding shifts from questioning what trees witness to knowing they absorb, a realization earned through handling the sextant's quantified sorrow. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("the sheer pressure of it") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure builds from finding the sextant through dismantling it to understanding how trees absorb sorrow, culminating in Elias's acceptance of his role as one who "passes sorrow along." The resonant reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost—the weight trees carry. Deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the labyrinth setting and for some causality softness in how the sextant's pieces disappear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The labyrinth that "breathed" and "shifted" functions as more than setting—it responds to truth being uncovered, groaning when the sextant reveals its sorrow. Moonlight pools "like liquid silver," creating the luminous workspace where memory unfolds. The trees as "silent sentinels" that absorb all dropped things constrains the story's logic about where sorrow goes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through the sextant's dismantling—each piece pulses, the air thickens, Elias feels "a sorrow, quantified." The escalation from questioning what trees witness to understanding they absorb represents meaningful deepening. Cost appears in the trees growing "heavier" and Elias's hands "still stinging from the sextant's memory," though the protagonist's agency in the resolution could be stronger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of how sorrow is held and transformed emerges organically through concrete images—brass bent "like a dying spider," trees turning grief into "rings, into bark, into the quiet, stubborn act of growing despite." The final image of oaks with "branches heavy with stars" resonantly answers the question of what trees witness without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with selective perception—Elias notices how corridors sigh, how the stairwell hums "when stars aligned just so." Syntax modulates effectively, shifting to fragments during revelation ("Not his own"). Some elevated diction ("immeasurable," "sentinels") occasionally strains against the craftsman POV but serves the mythic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty—"moonlight pooled like liquid silver," "brass arms bent like a dying spider." Information density is high, with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("the sheer pressure of it"), some filter constructions ("he felt it then"), and abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("Everything broken holds a memory").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of quantified sorrow held in objects and absorbed by trees offers a fresh angle on grief. The specific synthesis of astronomer's tool, labyrinth keeper, and absorbing trees creates an original mythology. The transformation of the sextant from measuring device to vessel of sorrow shows conceptual ingenuity, though some elements feel slightly familiar from literary fiction.</comment>
