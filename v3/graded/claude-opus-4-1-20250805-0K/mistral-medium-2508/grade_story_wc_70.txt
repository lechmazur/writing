<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's truth-telling affliction creates genuine internal tension, particularly when he admits "You're afraid it won't work." The choice to plant the seed represents a meaningful stance crystallization with visible cost (giving up his father's legacy), though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the compressed timeframe.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with strong closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the city's transformation from routine to wonder carries felt cost in the engineers' coming demands and the irreversible change. The seed-planting causally triggers the drones' chaotic dance, and the riddle's answer ("wonder") effectively reweights the entire premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lightning tower and beehive lattice create vivid, functional setting that constrains choice—Elias must climb to plant the seed. Sensory details like "ozone and damp earth" and "copper ribs still warm" effectively anchor the post-storm atmosphere, though some middle passages could sharpen spatial choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring wonder to a routinized city—escalates from personal doubt through the seed-planting to community transformation. The cost is legible in giving up the heirloom seed and accepting the engineers' coming disbelief, though the middle section could tighten pressure between discovery and action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The wonder/routine dichotomy emerges organically through the drones' transformation from "mapped and monotonous" to dancing "like they'd never known a grid." The child's gap-toothed grin and the old man's tears embody the theme without stating it, and the final image of Elias waiting for an unseen but felt sunrise resonantly answers the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical touches like "words spilled from him unbidden, raw as honey from a crushed comb." POV control remains stable, though some passages drift toward elevated diction ("lattice of humming wings") that slightly exceeds Elias's established register as a toll keeper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery, but occasional overwriting appears in metaphor density ("words spilled...raw as honey from a crushed comb" followed immediately by "curse felt heavier"). Some template cadence in the resolution sequence ("The engineers would come...Elias would tell them...They wouldn't believe him") reduces propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The truth-telling toll keeper and the seed that restores wonder offer fresh angles on familiar themes. The riddle mechanism and drone beehive create original world-building, though the resolution's emotional beats (child pointing, woman laughing) lean toward expected imagery.</comment>
