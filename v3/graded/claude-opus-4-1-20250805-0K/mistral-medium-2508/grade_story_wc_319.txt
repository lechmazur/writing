<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyssa's characterization emerges through embodied details like "her teeth ached" and the concrete action of waiting as both keeper and prisoner. The final choice to surrender the pendant and accept dissolution shows contradictory impulses (terror/familiarity) acting simultaneously in scene. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "dimensionally homesick" concept of the books, though this is mitigated by the visceral "shouting" metaphor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Lyssa's dissolution into the veil represents both Earned Stasis (accepting her role) and transformation with visible cost ("weight of words lifting from her bones"). The pendant exchange catalyzes the unraveling sequence causally. Cost is legible in the dissolution imagery and the line "finally brave enough to close."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frozen garden with mist creates immediate atmospheric pressure, and sensory details like "frost-etched spine" and "tarnished silver catching the sickly dawn" are vivid and selective. The environment constrains choice through the library's burned ruins and the pendant's discovery. Spatial choreography wavers slightly during the figure's appearance ("unfolding from" the ground), but the setting actively participates in the transformation sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to release or guard the books' dimensional longing—is signaled early and tightens through the pendant discovery and the figure's arrival. Lyssa's agency manifests in her choice to surrender the pendant, foreclosing her role as guardian with visible cost. The escalation from waiting to active choice under the Accumulative lens coheres, though the figure's sudden appearance lacks some causal grounding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between preservation and release, with the books' desire to be "released" rather than "preserved" offering genuine complexity. The final image of light looking "exactly like darkness, but softer" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to questions of boundaries and transformation. The recurring pendant and library motifs constrain choice and charge the closure without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyssa's perceptual signature is distinct—time going "slippery," the pendant's "hungry cold," her laugh at terror's familiarity. The lyric compression and patterned elision ("Not the wind, not the mist") serve the accumulative mode effectively. Dialogue carries subtext ("You've been holding my key") and advances plot efficiently. Minor moments of elevated diction ("dimensionally homesick") slightly exceed the POV's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the walls between here and *there* had started to thin, like parchment left too long in the rain"). Sentence variety and rhythm support the dreamlike atmosphere. Some figurative density in places ("spiral eating itself," "ink in water," "roots reversing") but these serve the surreal tone. No significant loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of books being "dimensionally homesick" and wanting release rather than preservation offers a fresh angle on the guardian-library relationship. The transformation of light into "exactly like darkness, but softer" provides unexpected resonance. The piece commits to its surreal premise without retreat, though some elements (cultists, pendant) draw from familiar genre territory.</comment>
