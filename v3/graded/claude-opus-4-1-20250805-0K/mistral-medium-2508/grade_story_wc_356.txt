<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to "cultivate serenity within motion" drives consistent choices from theft through acceptance, with embodied contradictions (precise hands vs. hunger) and a meaningful shift from seeking stillness to embracing sway. The transformation earns its cost through her willingness to face the Elders and the village's tacit approval signaled by the unlocked vault.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where Liora's realization that "serenity...wasn't in stillness, but in the sway itself" constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (theft exposed, Elders' judgment faced). The corpse flower as mirror device accumulates meaning through scent/vision/truth revelations, and the final unlocked vault shows communal transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The treetop village's swaying bridges and tidal rhythms create atmospheric pressure, while the corpse flower's evolving scent ("rotting honey" to "sweet and suffocating") tracks emotional progression. Sensory hierarchy favors olfactory detail matching Liora's expertise, though some descriptions ("thin as parchment") lean generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal ambition (stealing seed) through communal confrontation (Elders gathering) to village-wide revelation (flower as mirror showing collective fears), with Liora's agency driving each turn. The cost manifests in exposure and judgment, though the village's quick acceptance slightly softens the price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the corpse flower's transformation from forbidden wisdom to communal mirror, with the journal's doodles carrying generational knowledge that "words couldn't." The final insight about trust as "another name for" wisdom resonates without moralizing, earned through Liora's embodied experience of choosing vulnerability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with distinctive olfactory focus ("parse the grief in wilting lavender") and controlled rhythm that mirrors the village's sway. Some moments drift toward elevated register ("flotsam," "suffocating") that slightly exceed Liora's established voice, and dialogue absence limits full voice demonstration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, but several instances of elevated diction ("undercurrent that dragged truths to the surface like flotsam") and mild redundancy ("steady"/"stillness" cluster). The filter verb "knew" appears frequently without adding texture, though line-level craft supports the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The corpse flower as forbidden mirror rather than wisdom source offers a fresh angle, while the doodle-language and olfactory expertise create specific texture. The transformation from individual transgression to communal acceptance provides non-obvious resolution, though some elements (wise grandmother, mystical seed) draw from familiar templates.</comment>
