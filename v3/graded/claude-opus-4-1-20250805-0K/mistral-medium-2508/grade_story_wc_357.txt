<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like touching the broken arrow tip and feeling the moss spread on her skin. The transformation from pilot to "first to hear the planet's true voice" shows meaningful change with visible cost (her mentor's disappearance, the physical transformation). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("resilience wasn't something you found. It was something you *grew*") that edges toward theme-speak in the closing beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with escalating density through inversion, moss growth, and the seed's transformation into a singing sapling. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Veyra becomes symbiotic with the planet's resilience system, with visible cost in her physical transformation and her mentor's loss. The orientation anchors (orchard pilot, glider cockpit, inversion beginning) establish clearly by ~60 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The inverted gravity creates immediate spatial disorientation that constrains navigation choices, while the bioluminescent moss becomes both setting detail and plot driver through its growth-acceleration properties. The fracture-as-mouth image and golden sap viscerally ground the fantastical elements. The moss spreading on Veyra's body makes the environment literally inseparable from character transformation, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from navigation challenge to discovering the planet's secret to becoming physically transformed by it. The inversion's time limit creates genuine pressure, and Veyra's choice to let the moss spread rather than resist shows agency with clear cost. The tension between following her mentor's path and risking his fate works well, though the resolution feels slightly rushed in the final beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The resilience theme emerges organically through the planet's inversions and regenerative cycles, avoiding explicit moralizing until the late reflection "resilience wasn't something you found." The moss as both destroyer and creator, the seed containing instructions rather than just life, and the echoes as teaching create layered meaning. Deduction for the somewhat declarative thematic statements in the final third that briefly shift from scene to philosophy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with inventive sensory details ("soundless hum, a whirling silence that pressed against her eardrums") and consistent POV control. The prose rhythm accelerates during the inversion sequence and slows for discovery moments. Strong perceptual signature in how Veyra notices navigation details and interprets the planet's signals as communication rather than mere phenomena.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery ("water tracing silver paths through the air") and good momentum. Some repetitive structures appear ("She [verb]" opens multiple paragraphs) and occasional abstract phrasing ("resilience wasn't something you found"). The "whirling silence" paradox works as taught pattern. Minor template cadence in the closing sequence reduces density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements (planetary consciousness, symbiotic transformation) through specific details like gravity inversion as teaching mechanism and moss as accelerant rather than mere growth. The concept of echoes as instructions and the planet actively teaching resilience through physical trials offers genuine originality. The risk of making the protagonist physically transform rather than just learn elevates the stakes meaningfully.</comment>
