<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal conflict between stillness and motion drives authentic choices, particularly his decision to sync with the spinning hand rather than stop it. The contradictory impulses of repair/release act simultaneously in scene. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "the *idea* of it" and occasional drift into elevated register during emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias achieves Earned Stasis by leaving the hand spinning and walking away, with visible cost of abandoning his life's work. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and metaphysical observations build toward his transformation. Orientation anchors (lunar observatory, Elias as repair technician) establish clearly within opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choices effectively—the spinning hand forces Elias to climb to the turret, the thin air and impossible wind create pressure. Vivid sensory work with "wind carried the sound of leaves falling from trees that didn't exist." Doesn't quite reach 9-band as the environment could pressure tactics more directly in middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preservation vs. release escalates through Elias's choice to sync with the hand's rhythm rather than stop it, with clear cost of leaving his life's work. The pressure coheres under accumulative lens as physical sensations build. Missing sharper tactical shifts that would elevate to higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of constancy as "courage to move with change" emerges organically through Elias's transformation from repairer to one who accepts motion. The final image of him stepping forward while "the world—changeless, constant, *alive*—stepped with him" offers resonant non-literal answer. Minor deduction for slight abstractness in "luminous ache" phrasing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how Elias reads "fate in the cracks" and experiences time through repair work. Lyrical compression works well ("not the structure, but the *idea* of it"). Some register drift into elevated philosophical language ("the ephemeral," "escape velocity") slightly above POV's established lexicon as a repair technician.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though several instances of abstract phrasing ("luminous ache," "the ephemeral") and mild overwriting in metaphysical descriptions. Information density high in stronger passages. Template cadence appears in final section with repeated "Somewhere" openings and some paraphrase loops around the spinning/motion theme.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mechanical repair with cosmic observation creates non-obvious angle. The transformation of "broken things" expert who finally embraces breaking free shows originality. Specific details like cameras capturing time rather than light elevate beyond template. Doesn't reach highest bands due to familiar enlightenment arc structure.</comment>
