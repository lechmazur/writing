<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation crystallizes through concrete embodied details—the frost-bitten railing, her breath fogging glass, the physical act of sketching—with her final leap representing a believable transformation from passive observer to active seeker. The "blessed pariah" identity creates genuine internal contradiction between isolation and purpose that drives her choice. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "need to turn confusion into exploration" rather than fully embodied impulse at that pivot moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where Lira's leap through the anomaly achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—the compass pointing "through" rather than north reweights all prior navigation metaphors with clear cost (abandoning the station, embracing uncertainty). The mother's voice and the final image of someone reaching for a sketchbook crystallize the cyclical nature of observation across time. Slight deduction for the abstract quality of "somewhere else" which softens the otherwise sharp closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observation deck functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its "curved glass still holding" creates the boundary Lira must transcend, while the compass rose's warmth signals the anomaly's arrival. Sensory selection effectively narrows to breath-fog and metal-cold under stress. Deduction for some abstract spatial descriptions ("through the void, through the years") that lose physical grounding in the leap sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from passive sketching to active alignment of the sketch with stars, then the compass needle snapping into place, culminating in Lira's physical leap. The cost is legible—she abandons her role as station keeper to pursue an uncertain path. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of the anomaly's appearance after years of waiting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the reweighting of "true north" from fixed direction to dynamic passage ("pointing through"), with the family sketching custom revealed as key-making rather than mere documentation. The mother's whispered "You were always the one who looked closest" retroactively charges all prior observation with purpose. The stars' final assertion "They never had [lied]" provides resonant closure without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "breathless hum," "echoed silence," and the synesthetic "bell tolling underwater" creates a consistent voice of isolated observation. Some register elevation in philosophical moments ("temporal stretched," "fold between then and now") slightly exceeds the established lexicon. The POV maintains stable focalization throughout with purposeful withholding that pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in the shorter fragments building tension ("Her pulse quickened"). Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for abstract phrasing that loses clarity ("through the void, through the years"), some filter-verb clustering ("she realized," "she felt"), and the vague "somewhere else" construction that softens precision at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of observation-as-inheritance with navigation-through-rather-than-toward offers a fresh angle on the exploration narrative. The specific detail of sketching as key-making rather than documentation transforms the family custom trope. Risk-taking in the temporal fold ending heightens stakes though slightly abstract execution prevents higher scoring.</comment>
