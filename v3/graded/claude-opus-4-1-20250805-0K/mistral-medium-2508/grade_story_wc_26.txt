<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's sharp observation skills drive her discovery and the crucial decision to trade her shadow, with contradictory impulses (protection vs. curiosity) acting simultaneously in scene. The final exchange carries visible cost as her shadow thins, though some interior passages drift toward abstract reflection rather than embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered discoveries (stone → footage → poet's history → shadow exchange), with Resonant Reconfiguration landing when Liora's sacrifice transforms both shadows into peaceful guardians. Cost is visible in her thinned shadow and the line "tinged with regret—not for what was lost, but for the beauty of what remained," though the curator's protective lie feels slightly undermotivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating library and river stone constrain Liora's choices—the stone's "softly deliberate resistance" and the library's "shelves heavy with books that bloomed with light" create a lived-in magical reality. Setting directly enables the resolution as the library "makes room for one more story," though some descriptive passages prioritize atmosphere over tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity about the stone to understanding the shadow phenomenon to risking her own essence, with the dominant stake (preserving hope's shape) crystallizing through Liora's sacrifice. The tightening occurs when she realizes she's "already half-empty" and vulnerable, though middle sections could apply more immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete exchange of shadows to preserve hope, with the river stone serving as a physical anchor for abstract longing. The ending reweights earlier material—"Some hopes were too heavy to carry alone"—without moralizing, and the poet's single line gains resonance through Liora's enacted understanding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" and selective attention to shadows/transitions maintains throughout, with controlled modulation during the shadow exchange. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("metamorphose," "softly deliberate") that slightly exceeds the established voice, though the lyric mode generally coheres.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("The library floated above the clouds like a forgotten promise") with good rhythmic variation, but suffers from occasional template cadence ("She would tell it like this," "The curator would record it") and some paraphrase loops around the shadow concept. Information density is generally strong with most lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of detached emotions becoming independent entities offers a fresh angle on hope and loss, with specific execution through the shadow-trading mechanism. The synthesis of library-as-repository and shadows-as-vessels creates non-obvious resonance, though some elements (floating library, blooming books) lean toward familiar magical realism tropes.</comment>
