I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through pattern, repetition, and density toward a resonant reconfiguration where Liora accepts her role as keeper of cosmic balance.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's curse of "always knowing the moment before something shifted" creates genuine internal tension that drives her compulsive pattern-making. The final acceptance of her role as promise-keeper lands with earned resignation, though her agency feels more reactive than proactive in middle beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Liora accepts her eternal role with visible cost: "her footsteps the only friction left in the world." The accumulative structure coheres through dust/pattern/promise motifs, and orientation anchors establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frictionless world and collapsed star dust constrain every choice—Liora can only work where "tide couldn't reach," and the dust's weight/warmth drives the climactic harnessing. The bluff functions as both literal workspace and liminal threshold between worlds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: painted rocks trembling → dust burning through skin → eels returning transformed → accepting eternal duty. The cost crystallizes in Liora's bodily integration with the dust ("settled into her bones") and isolation as the last friction-bearer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme emerges through concrete particulars: promises that outlive their makers, patterns as cosmic anchors, the burden of knowledge. The final image of Liora walking eternally offers a non-literal answer about duty versus freedom without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice modulates from contemplative ("slick as a breath held too long") to visceral during the harnessing ("fingers bleeding where the grains bit too deep"). The perceptual signature—always sensing the moment before change—shapes every observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong figurative language occasionally tips toward density ("aurora above pulsed like a dying heartbeat, its green and violet threads tangling") but serves the accumulative mode. Some filter constructions ("Liora saw herself") could be more immediate, though rhythm effectively accelerates through the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of eel herding, cosmic dust, and pattern-making creates an original mythology. The concept that sacred patterns are "anchors" preventing something from unmaking reality transforms expected fantasy tropes through specific, grounded execution.</comment>
