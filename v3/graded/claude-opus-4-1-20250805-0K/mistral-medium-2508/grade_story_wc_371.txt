I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern accumulation (bread appearances, transformations) and cadence shifts that reweight meaning, culminating in the bakery's return.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's "heuristically gentle" trait manifests through concrete actions (replanting flagstones, distributing bread) with visible cost—the guards' indifference, years of solitary noticing. The final hand-taking gesture with the prince crystallizes her character arc. Minor deduction for the prince's underdeveloped presence despite his emotional weight at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through the bakery's return, with felt cost in the prince's weeping and the city's years of "adjusting" to wrongness. The accumulative pattern (bread→wheat→baking→distribution→return) builds coherently. Slight opacity around the causal mechanism of the bakery's disappearance/return prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned tea house and overgrown courtyard effectively constrain choices and enable the transformation. "The copper kettle still whispered over a fire no one had lit" creates uncanny atmosphere. The wheat overtaking the fountain provides strong environmental pressure. Spatial choreography occasionally blurs between locations.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative deepening: single bread→planting→wheat field→mass baking→city transformation. The dominant stake (confronting vs. adjusting to wrongness) tightens when guards abandon posts. Cost is visible in years of absence and the prince's tears, though the resolution's ease slightly undermines earned tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the bread's impossible warmth and the horror of normalized strangeness. "That was the creeping horror—not the strangeness itself, but how swiftly it became normal" resonates without preaching. The sacred emerging through "crumbs and cracks" offers a non-literal answer to finding meaning in the ordinary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with lyrical compression: "flour once dusted the air like snow." POV maintains consistent limited perspective with selective noticing. Some filter verb accumulation ("She reached out," "She carried it") slightly dulls immediacy. The prince's silence works as effective dialogue restraint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative imagery. Information density high in descriptive passages. Some template cadence in middle sections ("She + verb" patterns). "Uncloaked" repetition works as purposeful pattern. Minor scaffolding in transition sentences between scenes reduces momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The reversal of a bakery's disappearance through bread-planting offers fresh inflection on restoration narratives. "River runs backward on Tuesdays" and similar details create distinctive worldbuilding. The guerrilla gardening through mystical agriculture transforms the expected approach, though the resolution's tidiness reduces risk-taking impact.</comment>
