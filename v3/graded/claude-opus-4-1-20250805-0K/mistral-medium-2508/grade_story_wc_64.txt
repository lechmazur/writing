<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation builds through concrete embodied details—his warm fingers from soil, his tilted head at the breathing tapestry—and his final choice to reset the chess pieces carries visible cost in accepting the widow's true burden. The contradictory impulses (shouldn't be playing chess/compelled to untangle) act simultaneously in scene, though the widow remains more functional than fully realized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's understanding that "intentions were just knots waiting to be named," with visible cost in his acceptance of the widow's real request for unraveling rather than burial. The accumulative/textural lens holds as each unknotted thread deepens meaning, though the orientation anchors arrive slightly late (who/where clarifies around line 3-4).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The silo's iron ribs and the tapestry's breathing threads constrain Elias's choices, particularly when "the silo's door never quite latched" becomes meaningful context for the dead's restlessness. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (damp earth and rust, wet stone and lavender), though the cemetery setting could pressure the action more directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Each unknotted thread escalates pressure—from released breath to drowned man's scent to chorus of voices—culminating in the revelation that transforms Elias's understanding of his role. The cost is legible in his acceptance of becoming the widow's confessor rather than just a gardener, though the stakes could tighten more sharply through the middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of intentions as knots, with the final image of reset chess pieces offering a non-literal answer about truth versus burial. The story resists tidy resolution, leaving Elias with "the weight of the case" and a deepened understanding, though one instance of theme-echo appears ("intentions were just knots").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Elias's gardener's lens ("rows of marigolds and lamb's ear, their roots whispering secrets") and maintains consistency even under pressure. The lyric compression serves the accumulative design well, though occasional elevated diction ("sovereign case," "cobalt silo") slightly strains against the gardener's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("the widow Hester, younger, her hands pressed to her belly"), but some figurative density accumulates without full payoff ("stars hung low enough to touch"). Minor template cadence appears in the unknotting sequence ("The first knot... The second knot..."), though the progression justifies the pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The central conceit of unraveling literal knots to reveal buried truths offers a fresh synthesis, with the chess game framing adding unexpected resonance. The transformation of the widow from insistent questioner to revealed victim shows genuine complexity, though the execution occasionally reaches for elevated register that doesn't fully integrate.</comment>
