I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through layered imagery and metaphor, building toward the viaduct's ascension as a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lior's motivation as a "horizon mapper" who practices patience as revolution is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment through his physical interaction with the viaduct. The internal conflict between his patience and his sister's fury creates genuine tension. However, the epiphany about patience lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene that would elevate to higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively with the viaduct's ascension as Charged Poise—options crystallized, cost felt through Lior's isolation from the sanctuary. The accumulative lens holds as imagery builds from frozen lake to rising bridge. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. Minor deduction for the viaduct's physics remaining somewhat opaque despite being central to closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct create a vivid, constraining environment that shapes Lior's final choice to walk onto the rising bridge. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("iron bones singing," "breath curling into frigid air"). The viaduct functions as both setting and constraint, directly enabling the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—revolution through patience versus action—is signaled early and deepens through the viaduct's transformation. The sister's challenge provides genuine pressure that forces Lior's stance crystallization. The cost is legible in his isolation ("did not look back") though the viaduct's actual rising feels slightly convenient despite the moon-path setup.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of patience as revolution, avoiding direct moralizing. The recurring moon-path imagery and the transformation of "waiting" into "its own kind of fire" offers resonant answers without stating a thesis. The final image of Lior walking toward "the patient, wild unknown" reweights all prior material effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("fingers tracing the jagged lip," "celestial unyoking of weight from burden"). The POV maintains consistency with Lior's patient, observational nature. Minor register elevation in places ("celestial unyoking") slightly exceeds the established lexicon but remains largely coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, several instances of elevated diction border on overwriting ("celestial unyoking of weight from burden," "the raw, restless stone of impatience"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("The revolution would not be loud. / It would be a horizon, slowly revealing itself"). Information density is moderate but could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of patience as revolution and the magnetic viaduct that rises by moon-pull offers fresh angles on familiar revolutionary themes. The synthesis of physical and philosophical elements feels mostly organic. The transformation from frozen to flowing as metaphor for change is somewhat familiar but executed with sufficient specificity to avoid feeling derivative.</comment>
