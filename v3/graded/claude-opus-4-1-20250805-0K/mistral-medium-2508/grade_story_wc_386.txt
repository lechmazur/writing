I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds meaning through pattern, image recurrence, and cadence shifts rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's contradictory impulses manifest beautifully in her simultaneous connection to and distance from the dead ("I did. I just kept the parts worth saving"). The widow's journey from grief to recognition earns its cost through embodied details like tears on glass. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("grief sharpening into something brighter") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lena's acceptance of selective salvaging reweights the entire premise with visible cost ("The cracks were how the light got in"). The accumulative structure coheres through recurring images of glass, ice, and light that gain weight with each return. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The glacier-shrine setting constrains every choice—from the candles' thin flames to the ice groaning like ship timbers. The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting that literally transforms grief into vision. Physical details like "blue veins pulsing" make the environment alive and pressurized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: widow's plea → globe vision → wrong ghost revelation → Lena's own reckoning. The deepening from helping another to confronting her own salvaged wreckage ("My turn") creates meaningful pressure. Cost is legible in both the widow's transformed understanding and Lena's accepted burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of salvaging "parts worth saving" from wreckage. The final image of cracks letting light in offers a non-literal answer to grief's question without moralizing. The snow globe's transformation from frozen to fluid mirrors the thematic journey perfectly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm ("The dead didn't shout; they seeped through cracks"). Perceptual signature strong in how Lena perceives the dead as "the color of old silver." Dialogue carries subtext effectively, though limited amount prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("glacier breathed, its blue veins pulsing"). Some abstract phrasing weakens immediacy ("grief sharpening into something brighter," "borrowed starlight"). Minor repetition of "wreckage" concept without sufficient variation. Information density high in stronger passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The wreck-diver as grief counselor offers a fresh angle, and the melted snow globe as divination tool is inventive. The revelation about the wrong ghost transforms expectation. However, the grief-counseling frame itself is familiar territory, preventing higher originality despite strong specific execution.</comment>
