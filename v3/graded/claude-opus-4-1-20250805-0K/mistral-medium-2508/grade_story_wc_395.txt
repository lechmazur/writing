<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to uncover her brother's erasure drives increasingly risky choices with clear internal conflict between duty and family loyalty. The final choice to let the algorithm take her shows earned transformation through specific pressures, though some emotional beats rely on abstraction ("the hum of the servers sounded like a heartbeat") rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage from discovery of the patch through to Lena's deletion, with the recurring numbers serving as both mystery and key. The Decisive Change lands with clear cost—Lena sacrifices her existence to restore the erased crew. Minor orientation wobble with "neural lace" and worldbuilding details that arrive late without full integration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The digital archive functions as both setting and antagonist, with server farms and data structures constraining Lena's choices throughout. Strong micro-setting work with the patch's physical warmth against digital coldness. The "echo of forgotten songs" directory and specific server coordinates ground the abstract digital space effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to existential sacrifice as Lena discovers the system's consumption of human memory. The tightening occurs when she must choose between safety and restoration, with clear cost in her flagging for termination. The conflict between preservation duty and family loyalty creates authentic tension that pays off in her final acceptance of deletion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory erasure versus preservation emerges through concrete actions rather than statement, with the final image of the open childhood door offering resonant closure. The lullaby motif and recurring numbers accumulate meaning without heavy-handed symbolism. Some thematic language ("the place where lost things went") edges toward abstraction in the final beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends technical precision with emotional undertow, maintaining consistent POV through Lena's perceptual filter. Dialogue from Elias through the patch creates an effective uncanny moment. Minor register drift in phrases like "ghost-light of a trillion forgotten posts" that reach for poetry over character-grounded perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong momentum, though figurative density occasionally obscures clarity ("hummed like a dying star," "firewalls flaring like angry stars"). Some paraphrase loops around the deletion concept and mild template cadence in the final sequence. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital archaeology with personal loss, avoiding typical cyberpunk tropes through specific emotional grounding. The concept of a system that "edits out" rather than simply deletes people offers a non-obvious angle. The revelation that the archive preserves what it's told to forget creates genuine surprise that feels earned through prior setup.</comment>
