<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal conflict between exposing truth and deepening darkness plays out through concrete choices (returning to the bar, letting puppets stumble), with the miner's confrontation forcing a genuine reckoning. The grandfather's lightning-struck stick serves as both talisman and embodied memory, grounding abstract ethical questions in physical gesture. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("half-lit epiphanies") that occasionally replaces embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds through layered imagery (dome/echo, fire/shadow, puppet/string) toward Elias's decision to reveal the mechanics of manipulation—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost in vulnerability. The miner's confrontation catalyzes this shift from hidden to exposed storytelling. Slight opacity around the specific puppet show content that triggered the violence weakens causal linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The radar dome's acoustic properties and history as a "machine built to listen, now deaf" constrains Elias's artistic choices and charges the final image of being "swallowed...then let go." Salt flats that "remembered every footprint and erased it by dawn" mirror the story's tension between revelation and erasure. The Static Hound's atmosphere of forgotten names creates pressure for truth-telling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The miner's violent reaction escalates from passive audience to physical threat, forcing Elias to reconsider his methods with clear cost—tomorrow he'll expose the strings. This single tightening turn narrows his options from puppet-master to vulnerable performer. The stake of ethical storytelling coheres through the shift from concealment to revelation, though only one major pressure point limits the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete tension between truth as "blade" versus "puppet's string," culminating in Elias's realization that ethical storytelling requires showing "the hands moving, the seams showing." The recurring fire/shadow imagery accumulates meaning, with the final "half-lit" state embracing partial illumination over false clarity. The story resists moralizing while exploring how stories can wound or manipulate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice balances lyrical compression ("meteor hush," "the kind of quiet that follows a shouting match") with precise physical detail. POV remains tightly controlled through Elias's selective perception—noticing acoustic curves, grain patterns, the weight of inherited objects. The prose rhythm modulates effectively between contemplative passages and the sharp violence of the miner's intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong figurative control with purposeful imagery (dome as "permanent sigh," shadows "unspooled like silk") that serves thematic pressure. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("half-lit epiphanies," "ethical storytelling") that could be more embodied, and some repetitive constructions around "the way" that create minor template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of Cold War surveillance architecture with puppet theater creates an unexpected venue for exploring truth and manipulation. The lightning-struck stick as inherited artistic tool adds specificity. The choice to show failed performance before philosophical reflection inverts expected structure effectively, though the ethical storytelling concept itself follows familiar territory.</comment>
