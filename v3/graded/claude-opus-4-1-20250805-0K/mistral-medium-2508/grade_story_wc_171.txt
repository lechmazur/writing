I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through recurring images (the terrace, the clipboard's notches, the ritual of signing) and achieves closure through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the act of signing—despite its futility—becomes the price of choosing hope.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied contradiction between Veyra's trained steadiness ("operatively gentle") and her internal tremor, with the clipboard's notches physicalizing her history of failed treaties. The moment where Kael reaches for the clipboard with "callouses catching on the ebony's polished grief" shows excellent character-specific perception. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("the quiet violence of hope") that briefly escapes embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where signing becomes redemption's installment payment, with visible cost in Kael's unraveling voice and the "newest notch, where the wood was still soft." The accumulative structure coheres through the clipboard's history, the terrace's memory, and the ritual's repetition, all converging on the paradox that trying again despite inevitable failure IS the redemption.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The terrace functions as more than setting—it "remembers" and "exhales," constraining the negotiation to this specific site of accumulated failures. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (crushed lavender mixing with gunpowder, the clipboard smooth as river stones). Doesn't quite reach higher bands as the environment could more actively shape tactical choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulation: from "You asked for terms" to "I asked for an end" to the revelation of Kael's earlier signature, building to his trembling reach for the pen. The cost is legible in "his voice was already unraveling, already human" and the physical act of signing despite knowing it will fail. One meaningful deepening that reweights the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the concrete image of notches accumulating on the clipboard, each a failed treaty that still matters. The final insight—"The price of redemption was never paid in full. Only in installments"—reweights all prior signatures as necessary attempts rather than failures, earned through the specific ritual rather than stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("the grain dark as the void between stars"). Dialogue carries strong subtext, particularly "You'll break this one too"/"Probably." Some register elevation in places ("the quiet violence of hope") that slightly exceeds the POV's established range, and occasional filter phrases ("She did not flinch") that could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, but several instances of abstract phrasing that slow momentum: "the quiet violence of hope," "the slow, flawed beauty of choosing." Some repetitive structures ("Somewhere, a war was ending. Somewhere else, another would start") work as pattern but occasionally feel templated. Information density is good but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of eternal negotiation with the physical accumulation of failed treaties as notches on wood. The specific detail of ink made from the dead's ashes and the pen from the first bomb's olive tree transforms familiar peace-negotiation material. The insight that redemption comes through repeated imperfect attempts rather than success offers genuine freshness.</comment>
