<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to restore voice to the silenced city is clear and consistent, with embodied tension in his hunched posture and the physical risk of execution. The arrival of Lira crystallizes his purpose through her transcribed lyrics—proof his broadcasts are working. His choice to include her despite danger shows genuine cost, though the disappearance ending feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the dust learning to "wait and listen" after Elias vanishes, his message spreading citywide. The seventeen-year story famine establishes clear stakes, and Lira's arrival provides the tightening that forces Elias's choice. Cost is visible in his disappearance and the empty alcove, though the mechanism of his escape remains unexplained.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ember alcove with yellowed sheet music and mist coiling through cracked windows creates immediate atmosphere that constrains action—Elias must broadcast secretly from this hidden space. The radio's luminous glow that dims when broadcasting is a brilliant detail that physicalizes the risk. Salt on Lira's coat and dust that shimmers when trying to speak elevate setting beyond description into active story elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring stories to a censored world—intensifies through Lira's arrival, which forces Elias from solitary broadcaster to active teacher. The Ministry's executions establish real danger, and the dust beginning to "sing" shows escalation. However, Elias's disappearance lacks agency—it happens to him rather than through his choice, weakening the closure's earned quality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of voice and silence emerges organically through the dust learning to tell stories, the radio siphoning light into sound, and Lira remembering "the color blue" in a world stripped of beauty. The recurring phrase "The wind carries what the mouth cannot hold" becomes the city's graffitied resistance without heavy-handed moralizing. The final image of dust learning to wait and listen offers resonant ambiguity about persistence under oppression.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent lyrical elevation with phrases like "the ember alcove hummed like a forgotten hymn" and "mist thick as regret." POV remains stable with Elias, though some constructions like "the dust needed to learn" edge toward omniscient certainty. Lira's simple dialogue "I remember the color blue" contrasts effectively with the narrator's density, creating authentic voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong figurative language throughout ("mist coiled...thick as regret," "dust on their fingers would remember how to whisper") creates atmosphere but occasionally obscures clarity—how exactly does dust "tell" someone where to find Elias? Some repetitive constructions appear ("Elias had spent," "He'd found," "He began"). The final section's passive construction of Elias's disappearance weakens momentum when active choice would strengthen closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of dust learning to tell stories after a "story famine" offers fresh metaphorical territory, avoiding typical dystopian resistance tropes. The radio that dims when broadcasting, siphoning light into sound, provides original physics. Lira remembering "the color blue" captures loss with specificity. The execution stays committed to its lyrical register throughout.</comment>
