I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rigorous rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Identified: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the dead achieve rest.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as the stubborn undertaker who "buried the dead in a place where the sea had already claimed the living" is beautifully embodied through concrete actions and the visceral warmth of the lens calling "through his bones." His final choice to add his own name to the ledger while understanding "rest wasn't the absence of movement" demonstrates earned character evolution with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the dead's acknowledgment transforms rest from absence to presence ("you are here"), with clear cost in Elias's acceptance of his role. The accumulative structure coheres through water imagery, building from the drowned city to the lighthouse climb to the final "sediment" settling, though the lens's sudden appearance could use stronger grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The underwater library setting actively constrains and shapes every choice—from the "bioluminescent anemones" providing light to the "currents [that] fought him" during his swim. The micro-details like "waterlogged books" and "stained-glass dome fractured just enough" create a lived-in world that charges the final image of "quiet settle[d], thick as sediment."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving the dead their rest—escalates from ledger-keeping to the lens's arrival to the lighthouse climb, with meaningful deepening when Elias understands "the city wasn't finished sinking." The cost manifests in his acceptance of his role and the lens crumbling after its purpose, though the middle section could tighten its pressure points.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically through the concept that "rest wasn't the absence of movement. It was the signal that said *you are here*"—a non-literal answer to the story's central question about acknowledgment versus rescue. The lighthouse lens as broken signal becoming a tool for acknowledgment rather than warning creates thematic resonance without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice maintains distinctive texture through phrases like "cracked from salt and sorrow" and "pulse slow, like the breath of a sleeping beast," with controlled rhythm that modulates under pressure. The perceptual signature—how Elias notices decay and persistence simultaneously—remains consistent while allowing compression during the climb sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The tide had long since swallowed the city, but Elias Vey still kept his ledger dry" establishes setting, character, and tension). Some figurative density in places ("trapped scream," "sea...coughed up a piece of its own guilt") but generally serves the accumulative mode without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of an underwater undertaker who helps the already-drowned find rest offers genuine freshness, transforming the lighthouse-as-beacon trope into something about acknowledgment rather than rescue. The specific synthesis of drowning/drowned states and the final insight about rest as presence demonstrates risk-taking that heightens meaning.</comment>
