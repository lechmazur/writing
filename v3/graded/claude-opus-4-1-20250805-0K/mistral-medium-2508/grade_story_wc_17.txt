<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation crystallizes through embodied discovery—the film negative burning in his pocket, his shaking hands aligning faces with the mural. The final choice to sketch echoes rather than map them shows genuine character evolution with visible cost ("the burden of legacy remained—no longer a chain, but a thread"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("weight of legacy") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the corridor transforms from whispering to singing, the sealed door becomes an open threshold. Cost is visible in Elias's choice to engage with painful family memory and the physical act of completing the mural through dawn. The pattern of echoes→faces→song creates meaningful escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage functions as active setting, with walls that remember and dream, directly constraining Elias's choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("damp stone," "scent of old smoke and wet earth"). The setting literally transforms at closure, becoming luminous. Slight deduction for some generic post-apocalyptic markers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from mapping echoes to confronting personal legacy through the discovered negative and father's diary. The pressure coheres around whether Elias will remain a passive cartographer or actively engage with his family's story. Cost is clear in the emotional labor of completing the mural and the transformed relationship with the space.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the distinction between dreaming and remembering, with the final transformation from trapped echoes to song. The story resists simple resolution—legacy becomes "a thread he could choose to follow or cut." The resonant final image of the glowing murals reweights all prior exploration without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with Elias's synesthetic ability to hear/map echoes others miss. Voice maintains consistency through lyrical descriptions and specialized vocabulary ("corridor echo cartographer"). Some elevated diction ("ivy-veiled," "sensitively perceptive") occasionally strains against the intimate POV, and dialogue absence limits full assessment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations and strong sensory specificity. However, several template constructions appear ("Elias had spent a lifetime trying," "He wanted to know...but more than that") and some abstract phrasing ("weight of legacy," "burden of legacy") that could be more concrete. The repetition of "legacy" without variation shows minor synonym avoidance issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of mapping corridor echoes in climate-ravaged ruins offers genuine freshness, particularly the revelation that walls remember rather than dream. The transformation from passive cartography to active memorial-making provides an earned emotional arc. The specific detail of half-burned diaries and film negatives grounds the fantastical premise.</comment>
