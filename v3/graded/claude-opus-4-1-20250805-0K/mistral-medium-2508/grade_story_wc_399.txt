I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern toward Lysan's act of consecration and the desert's memory.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysan's motivation crystallizes through embodied detail—the half-mask against her cheek, palm on warm metal, forehead pressed to the parapet. Her choice to hold the clearing "long enough" carries visible cost through physical intimacy with the relic. Internal contradiction between preserving whispers and confronting the prophet's loud echoes drives authentic tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Earned Stasis closure—Lysan's consecration temporarily stabilizes the clearing against the prophet's erasure, with cost visible in "the weight in her chest eased just enough to breathe." The accumulative lens holds as density builds from whispers to song to stabilized borders. Minor orientation friction with "conjured clearing" and pavilion relationship slightly dulls early comprehension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its "pulse through peripheral awareness" and eventual song that fills "the hollows of her skull." Sensory detail layers effectively: crushed mint, "the first word ever spoken," silk walls sighing. The desert as witness and memory-keeper charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from sensing the parapet's pulse to full consecration where "the clearing's edges sharpened." The prophet's followers marking dunes with "sigils of flame" provides external pressure. Cost appears in Lysan's physical commitment and the temporary nature of her holding—"long enough" acknowledges inevitable loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between loud proclamation and quiet persistence—"wisdom survived...in the spaces between, in the peripheral." The half-mask symbolism (half-hidden, "strangely honest") reinforces this without heavy-handedness. The final image of the desert remembering offers resonant answer to whether subtle wisdoms can endure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm—"their voices threading through the murmuring pavilion like breath through reeds." Perceptual signature strong in how Lysan experiences the parapet's kinetics through touch and vibration. Dialogue minimal but effective, the pavilion voice neither "accusatory nor kind" carries appropriate subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence structure and purposeful repetition ("strangely honest, strangely whole"). Some figurative density in places ("like breath through reeds," "the way the desert states thirst," "like a second heartbeat") but serves accumulative texture. Minor scaffold in explaining wisdom's survival method reduces score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of consecration through remembering silence rather than ritual offers fresh angle on preservation. The half-mask detail and "line walker" role create specific texture. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative approach to magical realism pays off, though prophet-versus-keeper dynamic itself is somewhat familiar.</comment>
