<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias demonstrates clear motivation rooted in intellectual rebellion, with concrete embodied choices (planting coded messages, teaching others). His "charming rogue scholar" persona drives specific actions under pressure. The ending choice to step "into the chaos they'd grown" shows earned agency, though internal contradiction could be more visceral in-scene rather than described.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching (plant-based language system) that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where gardens become rebellion. The closure—Elias standing guard over "the spark of a thought, wild and untamed"—lands with conceptual cost (risk of discovery). Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words with greenhouse setting and Ministry context.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse and public gardens constrain choices (surveillance drones force coded communication through plants). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("damp earth and crushed mint"). The plant-language system makes setting integral to tactics, though some descriptions tend toward the generic ("sterile glow of compliance").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual thought-taxation to collective resistance through garden networks. The discovery signal (*they know*) tightens pressure and forces tactical adaptation. Cost is visible in risk taken, though the final confrontation ("the city would burn with questions") remains more declared than dramatized on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the plant-language metaphor—growth, roots, and natural resistance to control. The final image of the "gourd rattle seed split open in the dark" resonates without stating a moral. Subtext operates through gardening actions that encode rebellion, avoiding direct philosophical statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent texture with botanical metaphors woven naturally through POV perception ("speak in roots," "soil into syntax"). Distinct perceptual signature shows in how Elias notices plant details others miss. Some moments edge toward elevated diction ("the quiet *no* of a seed refusing to break") but mostly stay character-grounded.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density with sentences doing multiple jobs (characterization + worldbuilding + atmosphere). Some overwriting appears in peak moments ("burn with questions no ledger could answer") and occasional register drift. Line-level control is generally clean with varied sentence structures, though a few passages lean abstract.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of botanical resistance languages is genuinely fresh, transforming the surveillance dystopia trope through specific horticultural detail. Risk-taking in the unconventional communication system heightens stakes. The synthesis of gardening and coded rebellion feels inevitable in hindsight, avoiding generic dystopian templates.</comment>
