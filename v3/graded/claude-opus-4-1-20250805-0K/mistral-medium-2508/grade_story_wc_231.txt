I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and memory fragments toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elias accepts his role as keeper of borrowed memories.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's characterization succeeds through embodied details like fingers lingering on brass buckles and the specific way he notices gaps. His transformation from investigator to willing vessel lands with genuine cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "borrowed memories" that could be more viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural structure coheres beautifully as fragments of memory literally unfurl from the boutonnière, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts his role. The cost is legible in "the last breath of a drowning man pressed into the hands of the only soul willing to carry it." Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The opal dock "like a vein of forgotten bone" and the workshop with "jars of preserved storms" create a liminal world that constrains choice—only someone isolated like Elias could bear these memories. The setting actively shapes the ending, with the lighthouse beam serving as the mechanism for release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from receiving the flower, to investigating absences, to the saltwater revelation, to accepting the burden. The cost crystallizes when "the boutonnière would crumble by dawn" but the memory finds freedom. Could strengthen the middle investigation section's pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of borrowed memories as burdens passed between isolated souls. The lighthouse as witness to isolation creates perfect thematic resonance. The ending reweights everything without stating a moral—the light "doing the rest" is earned and haunting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "breath of the sea at nautical twilight" while staying grounded in Elias's perspective. The selective perception of gaps and absences reflects his lighthouse-keeper mindset. Minor moments of elevated diction slightly exceed the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with evocative imagery, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("the weight of something unsaid," "temporary vessel") and mild redundancy in the memory-exploration sequence. The filter verb "understood" disrupts immediacy in a key beat. Information density could be higher in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of memories literally preserved in a boutonnière that can be steeped to reveal faces and experiences is genuinely fresh. The synthesis of lighthouse keeper as memory keeper feels inevitable in retrospect. Transformation of the Edelweiss ship tragedy into this intimate exchange shows strong originality.</comment>
