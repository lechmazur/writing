I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Determination:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and recursive metaphors about memory, echo, and time, with density increases rather than causal turns driving toward closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The locksmith's motivation crystallizes through concrete particulars—his daughter's unanswered question about wonder propelling three years of echo-collecting. Internal contradiction plays effectively when "It wasn't about preservation. / It was about *access*" reframes his project mid-scene. The final choice to leave the timer running shows earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the timer's single tick "like a heartbeat catching up to itself" after the locksmith departs, leaving his reconstruction running—a Charged Poise that crystallizes the tension between holding and releasing time. The accumulative lens holds as metaphoric density increases toward this final image. Cost appears in "his throat tightened" and the conscious choice to abandon control.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The marble cavern's veined silver walls that "caught the dim light at odd angles" directly shape the locksmith's method of studying reflections to decode the timer. Setting constrains through the "wounded season" deadline forcing urgency. The cavern's acoustic architecture enables the entire echo-harvest system, though some descriptive passages lean ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as "the wounded season was ending; soon, the echoes would thin." The locksmith's accelerating work—"sketching diagrams in the dust with a charred stick"—shows urgency building toward the mechanism's completion. Cost manifests when his wife's voice returns but "warbled, stretched thin in places," acknowledging imperfection even in success.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of "storing wonder like a locksmith stores keys—just in case" without explicit moralizing. The final image of ice beginning to weep as the timer ticks offers a non-literal answer about accepting transience rather than perfect preservation. The "cellar of reason" metaphor accumulates meaning through repetition and transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled compression: "his breath fogging the cold air as he traced the fractured edges." The perceptual signature of "always seeing the thing beside the thing" defines the locksmith's oblique attention throughout. Rhythm modulates effectively during the climactic gear-turning sequence, though occasional overwriting ("bruised glow") slightly dulls precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose density works purposefully with lines doing multiple jobs: "The timer had once regulated the harvest of echoes" establishes worldbuilding, stakes, and loss simultaneously. However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms clarity ("the cellar of his reason, where he stored things that defied immediate use"). Some paraphrase loops appear: "It wasn't about preservation. / It was about *access*" restates rather than advances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmith-as-memory-engineer with the echo-harvest system creates an original metaphoric framework. The specific detail of studying reflections "at different times—dawn's pale slant, dusk's bruised glow" to decode patterns shows inventive world-logic. Risk-taking in the lyrical accumulative structure heightens resonance without sacrificing coherence.</comment>
