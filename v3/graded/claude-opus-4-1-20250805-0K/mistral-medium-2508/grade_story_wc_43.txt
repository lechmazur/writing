<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion through concrete details like the vinyl shard pressed to lips "for the way it bit" and Mrs. Calloway's knuckles white around the teacup. The protagonist's choice to play despite knowing futility, using music to "reunify" rather than distract, shows clear motivation rooted in her philosophy of "decisively kind." Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("hope shifted from a flame to a scent") rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered sensory details and the vinyl shard's transformation from talisman to release. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lena drops the shard—a visible renunciation with cost ("not a surrender, but a release"). Deduction for slight ambiguity in the cost's specificity; while the gesture is powerful, the exact price of letting go could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hospice setting effectively constrains choices through "pulsing stillness" and the physical space between window and bedside. Strong sensory work with chamomile, old paper, and "rain on hot pavement." The vinyl shard functions as micro-setting that shapes Lena's stance. Minor deduction because the "radiant haven above the clouds" framing feels slightly disconnected from the grounded interior scenes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes center on executing a "flawless goodbye" with Mrs. Calloway's terminal diagnosis as pressure. The music session deepens from performance to genuine connection when Mrs. Calloway recalls her husband. Cost becomes visible when Lena releases the vinyl shard. Deduction because the escalation is gentle rather than sharp—appropriate for the material but limiting dramatic tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of hope from "cure" to honoring "the time that was," crystallized in Mrs. Calloway's "You play it flawless"—meaning the goodbye, not the music. The vinyl shard's journey from sharp reminder to released burden carries thematic weight. Final image of Lena playing "for the living who would carry them forward" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception focused on tactile details and medical realities. Dialogue feels natural with subtext ("That's a hell of a hymn for a woman who'll never see another dawn"). Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("tapestry of her own existence") that slightly exceeds the established voice's range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high in key moments like "her fingers still warm from the last patient's palm—his grip loose now, his fight finally quiet." Deductions for occasional overwriting ("radiant haven painted in hues of rose gold") and some abstract phrasing ("hope shifted from a flame to a scent") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on hospice care through the music therapist's perspective, avoiding sentimentality through specific details like burned eggs and the vinyl shard. The concept of "flawless goodbye" as perfection in acceptance rather than execution shows originality. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure pays off with earned resonance.</comment>
