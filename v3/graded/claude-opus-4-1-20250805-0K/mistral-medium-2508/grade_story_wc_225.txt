<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tutor's internal journey from guilt to acceptance is earned through concrete embodied actions (fidgeting with threads, kneeling to touch the labyrinth floor) with visible cost at closure. His choice to stay and play "not to win" demonstrates genuine character change. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("the quiet alchemy of forgiveness") in late beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: the tapestry's threads accumulate meaning through physical manipulation until the closure reconfigures the tutor from exile to belonging, with cost visible in "scars, not sins." The village's unfreezing provides resonant reconfiguration. Deduction for slight orientation delay (village context emerges gradually) and some abstract phrasing around the labyrinth's function.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth and frozen village create atmospheric pressure, with the tapestry serving as micro-setting that constrains choice (he must unravel to understand). The frozen laughter and eventual thaw effectively mirror internal states. Minor deduction for some vague spatial choreography around the labyrinth's interior.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes center on redemption through confronting past failure, with the tapestry revealing "You were right to doubt. But wrong to leave" as the key tightening moment. The cost is visible when he accepts the child's invitation to play. Escalation is more accumulative than causal, fitting the textural lens but lacking sharp pressure increases.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between frozen/flowing time and the tutor's evolution from seeing "three moves ahead" to looking directly at his opponent. The final image of playing "not to win, but to stay" resonantly answers the central question of belonging versus exile without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyric voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception (focusing on threads, metallic veins, frozen moments). The brief dialogue feels natural and carries subtext. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("the quiet alchemy of forgiveness") that doesn't fully match the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful repetition of key images. Deductions for abstract phrases ("fierce repose," "quiet alchemy") and some overwriting in figurative language ("thunder's lull deepened, no longer distant but inside him"). The ending sequence maintains momentum despite these issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The time-frozen village as a space for confronting past mistakes offers a fresh angle on redemption narratives. The tapestry as both map and confession provides original texture. Some elements feel familiar (chess as metaphor for life) but the execution transforms them through specific detail.</comment>
