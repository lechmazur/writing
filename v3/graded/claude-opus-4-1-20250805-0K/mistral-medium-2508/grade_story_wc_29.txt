<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's contradictory impulses—caution warring with hope, professional exile against cosmic engagement—act simultaneously throughout, particularly in her hesitation over the transmit switch. Her final choice to interfere carries visible professional and existential cost ("I was just fixing the radio" understatement shows awareness of consequences). The embodied stress ("fingers that remembered every notch," "teeth ache") grounds her internal conflict effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the pattern accumulates through signal-to-social fracture correlations, building to Liora's intervention that shifts the alien signal from predatory to curious—a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The closure lands with "The universe was still talking. And now, so was she," crystallizing her changed stance from passive interpreter to active participant. Orientation anchors effectively (Liora, radio station basement, present-tense crisis).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The radio equipment and astronomical charts function as micro-setting that constrains choice—Liora must work with "equipment older than the university's newest power struggles." Sensory hierarchy reflects her expertise: "static hissed through the headphones like a nest of angry stars" filters cosmic phenomena through professional perception. The basement setting enables her clandestine work while the broader campus divisions create ambient pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (career exile) through institutional (university fractures) to cosmic (alien manipulation), with Liora's intervention forcing a trade-off between safety and agency. The pressure coheres through the accumulating signal-to-conflict correlations, tightening when she must decide whether to transmit. Cost is legible: professional risk, physical discomfort ("pressure in her skull"), and the uncertain outcome of engaging unknown entities.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the pattern of cosmic interference in human affairs, questioning agency versus manipulation. The final shift from predatory to curious signal, coupled with Liora's transition from interpreter to participant, offers a non-literal answer: resistance transforms the nature of engagement. "Wounds" becoming "scars—proof they'd survived something" reweights the campus conflicts as necessary trials rather than mere destruction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent academic-poetic register appropriate to Liora's expertise ("celestial signal interpreter," "harmonic resonance"). Perceptual signature strong: she experiences the cosmos through sound and frequency rather than visuals. Brief dialogue serves its function ("Dr. Voss?" / "Tell them...I was just fixing the radio") with appropriate subtext. Some filter verb accumulation ("she'd spent," "she'd been called") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong figurative language ("static hissed...like a nest of angry stars," "threading through the noise like a needle pulling string") enhances without overwhelming. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor repetitive structures ("She'd been called...She'd spent...") and occasional abstraction ("testing them, prodding at the cracks") prevent higher scoring. No loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of cosmic entities manipulating human conflicts through frequencies offers a fresh angle on first-contact narratives. Specific synthesis of astronomy, radio technology, and academic politics creates originality. The transformation from interpreter to active participant subverts the passive-observer trope. Some familiar elements (lone scientist discovers conspiracy) prevent exceptional scoring.</comment>
