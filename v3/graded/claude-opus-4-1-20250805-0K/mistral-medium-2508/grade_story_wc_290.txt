<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's claustrophobia creates genuine internal conflict that compounds under pressure in the shaft descent, with embodied fear ("lungs tightened," "breath turned traitor") driving his choice to continue despite terror. The final stance crystallizes through earned transformation from inheriting fear to understanding rebellion, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("Some doors weren't meant to be opened. They were meant to be *remade*").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught spatial mutiny that pays off when the chamber rearranges and Elias must choose to drive the key home, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where the city's blueprint rewrites itself. Cost is visible in the spatial threat and the inherited burden, though the ending's conceptual repricing ("Prudence had brought him this far. Rebellion would take him the rest of the way") could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The vault's wrongness ("had no right to exist") and the compass as inherited tool both constrain choices throughout, with spatial choreography clear during the descent and chamber transformation. The environment actively participates in the test through walls that shift and roots that coil, charging the final snow image as "tiny, fleeting mutiny against the dark."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: vault discovery → compass insertion → descent into fear → chamber rearrangement → forced choice with the key, each deepening the spatial mutiny theme. The "test" moment when the compass aims at Elias's chest creates genuine pressure with visible stakes, though the resolution's ease after driving in the key slightly deflates the built tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The inheritance theme ("the only honest thing left in this crooked world") reweights through action as Elias discovers the compass isn't for measuring but "transfixing," earning his father's smile through understanding. The spatial mutiny concept emerges through concrete imagery rather than statement, though the final meditation on prudence versus rebellion edges toward explicit thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm that modulates under pressure ("The compass's point *sang*... a high, keening whine") and selective perception focused on tactile cold and architectural wrongness. The italicized emphasis and fragment use ("Perfect timing.") serve voice purpose, with perceptual signature maintained even under peak stress in the chamber.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the slow weep of centuries" establishes age, atmosphere, and wrongness simultaneously) and varied syntax that accelerates during the chamber transformation sequence. Some elevated diction in peak moments ("the mutiny of space," "starved god") occasionally drifts from the established register but doesn't obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of spatial mutiny as active architectural rebellion offers a fresh angle on the lost key trope, with the compass's dual nature (measuring/transfixing) providing specific surprise. The transformation from prudent explorer to understanding rebel feels earned, though some imagery ("ribs of a starved god") relies on familiar gothic vocabulary.</comment>
