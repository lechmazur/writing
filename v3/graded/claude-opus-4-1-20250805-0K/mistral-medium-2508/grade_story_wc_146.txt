I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through rhythmic repetition, sensory accumulation, and pattern intensification rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tuner's motivation through patient rhythm and the town's gradual awakening create a coherent character arc with embodied stakes. Internal consistency holds as he synchronizes with the town's revival, though the final child's laughter feels slightly unearned given the established ghostly atmosphere.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the tuner's rhythmic persistence transforms the dead town into something alive, with clear cost in his physical exhaustion ("walked until his legs ached"). The accumulative lens holds consistently through rhythmic layering and sensory density that builds to the child's laughter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains and enables the revival - the archway frames entry, cobblestones carry rhythm, the well resonates memory. The town's transformation from "skeleton" to golden-lit windows creates a lived-in specificity that charges the final image of renewal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: shutter creaks, chime shivers, footsteps echo, windows light. The deepening from physical sounds to manifestations of past life ("scent of bread") creates meaningful tightening, though the stakes could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of tuning/balance as revival method. The final insight that "Balance...was not a thing you achieved. It was a thing you *kept*" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the entire revival as ongoing work rather than completion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("fingers stained with the dust of forgotten things"). The prose modulates effectively with the town's awakening, maintaining consistency even under pressure, with purposeful compression that serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clean prose with strong rhythmic control and high information density. Each sentence advances atmosphere or action without loops or scaffolding, though occasional elevated diction ("infinitely patient," "metronome ticking") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bell tuner as sonic resurrectionist offers a fresh angle on ghost town revival. The specific method of rhythmic awakening through footsteps and tuning fork creates originality, though the child's laughter ending feels somewhat conventional for the established eeriness.</comment>
