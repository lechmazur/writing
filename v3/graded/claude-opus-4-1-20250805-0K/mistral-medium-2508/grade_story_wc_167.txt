I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered images of light, water, and glass patterns that accumulate meaning toward a resonant reconfiguration about attention and meaning-making.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's characterization succeeds through embodied ritual and specific gestures (tracing the prism rim, choosing stones by weight). His motivation to find meaning in the mundane after his daughter's departure is earned through concrete details. The internal tension between maintaining faith in his practice and missing his daughter creates authentic complexity, though the resolution could push harder against cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently as patterns of light and water ripples build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration about attention as meaning-making. The closure lands with emotional cost (daughter's absence, the harbor's forgetting) though the final "reaching for the next stone" suggests continuation rather than decisive change. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting functions as more than backdrop - the atrium's prisms and pool actively constrain Elias's ritual and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt smell, wood groaning, mist like "the inside of a lung"). The micro-setting of stones and prisms directly shapes the central action of reading patterns.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake - whether mundane attention can yield meaning - intensifies through the ritual's progression from stone-throwing to pattern-reading to the boat's return. Escalation occurs through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens. Cost is visible in the daughter's absence and the harbor's inevitable forgetting, though agency could be stronger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the atrium's function as a space for "paying attention" to find meaning. The recurring motif of split light and ripples deepens from physical description to metaphor for perception. The daughter's phrase "noctilucent reckonings" elegantly names the practice without over-explaining. The ending offers a non-literal answer about persistence despite forgetting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinct meditative register with controlled rhythm that mirrors Elias's careful attention ("The stone broke the surface with a sound like a sigh"). The perceptual signature is consistent - noticing weight, texture, and light patterns through a craftsman's eye. Free indirect style is clean, and the prose modulates effectively between description and interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple layers. Some figurative density in peak moments ("mist like the inside of a lung," "wings cutting through mist like a blade through silk") but coherent within the lyric mode. Minor template cadence in "Elias [verb]" constructions but not pervasive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of a harbor glazier reading meaning in light patterns offers a fresh angle on grief and meaning-making. The specific synthesis of craft, loss, and attention feels earned rather than assembled. While the meditation-on-loss framework is familiar, the particular details (prism atrium, ripple-reading) transform it sufficiently.</comment>
