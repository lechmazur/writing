<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's obsession with the color of sound drives concrete choices throughout, from wading into cold shallows to lighting his own lantern in the frozen sky. His final understanding that truth must be "made" rather than found shows earned transformation with visible cost—the Marigold sinking deeper, his lantern forever changed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and symbolic resonances build toward Elias's final vow, with the shimmer of waves marking a Resonant Reconfiguration. The journey from physical library to metaphysical crucible traces cleanly, though the frozen sky sequence briefly strains comprehension before resolving into earned insight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Marigold's broken spine and waterlogged library constrain Elias's choices—he must wade, duck, navigate collapsed shelves. The festival lanterns' transformation from amber to impossible violet/gold charges the final image where waves don't just roar but "shimmer."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure escalates from reading about frequencies bleeding into hue, to finding the preserved book, to entering the impossible door—each discovery narrowing Elias's path toward his final choice to "make" rather than find. The cost manifests in his transformed lantern and the Marigold's deeper submersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of hidden versus waiting truths emerges organically through the library-as-crucible metaphor and culminates in "some truths aren't hidden—they're waiting." The transformation from passive seeking to active creation resonates without moralizing, with the shimmering waves embodying the synthesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines elevated diction ("bruised twilight," "paper skins glowing amber") with concrete sensory detail ("cold biting through his trousers"). The perceptual signature—Elias experiencing sound as color—remains consistent, and syntax modulates effectively between contemplation and discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines like "shelves sagged under books swollen with seawater, their pages fused into brittle sculptures" doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition in "Elias understood then" and some filter constructions ("he found," "he stood") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synesthesia concept (color of sound) offers a fresh angle, deepened by the library-as-crucible metaphor and the distinction between finding and making truth. The frozen lantern festival with impossible colors provides genuine surprise that feels earned through prior groundwork.</comment>
