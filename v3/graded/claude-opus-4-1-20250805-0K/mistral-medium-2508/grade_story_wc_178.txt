I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered discovery and pattern recognition toward a resonant reconfiguration where Qishti's understanding of the universe fundamentally shifts.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Qishti's motivation builds clearly from empirical scholar to seeker of hidden knowledge, with concrete embodied details like "pulse quickened" and specific actions revealing character under pressure. The final acceptance of unmeasurable devotion contradicts his lifetime of measurement, creating genuine internal conflict. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract epiphany about dialogue with the universe.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Qishti's fundamental understanding shifts from measuring a mechanical universe to participating in dialogue, with visible cost in his transformed hands bearing the schematic's traces. The accumulative structure coheres through pattern discovery leading to conceptual repricing. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in the "dialogue" revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail throughout ("sandals whispering," "warm beneath his fingers," "scent of damp") with the tile and underground sanctum constraining choices and enabling discovery. The setting actively shapes Qishti's path through hidden passages and ancient schematics. Doesn't quite reach higher bands as some descriptions remain functional rather than transformative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity about a loose tile through decoding its cipher to the threshold decision of entering the unknown passage, with clear cost in abandoning empirical certainty. The pressure builds through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens. The final transformation carries weight but could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the journey from measurement to faith, with the phrase "What is measured is never lost" serving as perfect crystallization. The story explores the limits of empirical knowledge without stating its thesis, and the final image of stars burning "intimate" rather than distant resonantly answers the central question about understanding's nature.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("counted grains of sand...now counting tiles"), though some passages drift toward elevated register ("cosmic where stars were not distant fires but living eyes"). The perceptual signature remains consistent with an astronomer's precise observation. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of elevated diction that creates distance ("empirically ironic thrill," "frugal rhythm"). Some repetitive structures in the middle section ("For three nights...," "On the fourth night..."). The closing achieves strong resonance despite these minor frictions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle on the scholar-discovers-hidden-knowledge trope through specific details like the astronomer's frugality and the schematic-as-love-letter concept. The transformation from empirical measurement to cosmic dialogue offers genuine insight. Some elements feel familiar (hidden chamber, ancient altar) but are executed with sufficient specificity.</comment>
