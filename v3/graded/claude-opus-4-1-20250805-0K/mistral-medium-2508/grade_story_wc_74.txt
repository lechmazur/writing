<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The painter's forty-three nights of sleeplessness creates a compelling embodied state that drives his methodical hope through concrete action. His motivation crystallizes through the memory of the calligrapher's gift and her words about "when words won't come in your own tongue," earning the final choice to continue despite exhaustion. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around kindness that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure - the fig tree's new leaf and the painter's acceptance of sleep create visible transformation with felt cost (forty-three nights of exhaustion). The piece teaches its pattern of lost languages and kindness early, paying off when the leaf disappears but the brush shows signs of use, suggesting the kindness was received. Orientation anchors (painter, greenhouse, rooftop) establish clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains choices effectively - it's the only place where "air still tasted of green things" and moonlight can penetrate the smog, making it essential for the ritual. The dying fig tree serves as both canvas and participant, its new leaf marking transformation. The smog-choked city below creates necessary contrast, though more sensory detail beyond visual could strengthen immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: from painting on dying leaves to the tree shuddering and producing new growth, to the painter finally yielding to sleep after forty-three nights. The cost is embodied in his exhaustion and the worn brush tip suggesting mysterious continuation. The dominant stake - proving kindness persists among strangers - faces its test when the leaf vanishes but evidence remains.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of writing dead languages on dying leaves, with the final image of the worn brush tip suggesting kindness was indeed remembered by unknown hands. The piece resists explicit moralizing, letting the jasmine scent's return and the child's laughter create resonance. The ending's "Somewhere, a stranger woke" offers a non-literal answer to whether kindness persists.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism - "the moon could slip through the haze like a coin dropped into a wishing well" shows the painter's hopeful perception. POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance, modulating effectively during the tree's shuddering moment. Minor repetition in "Somewhere" constructions at the end, though this creates intentional rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "languages of curved thorns and floating dots." Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some repetitive structures appear ("He wondered if," "Somewhere") and occasional abstraction around kindness concepts. The "methodically hopeful" phrase feels slightly forced, and there's minor template cadence in the final "Somewhere" sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of painting dead languages on dying leaves to prove kindness persists shows originality, though the resolution feels somewhat expected. The specific detail of the moon-tipped brush and the forty-three nights creates memorability. The transformation of the familiar "message in a bottle" concept through botanical medium and lost languages adds freshness.</comment>
