I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern rather than strict causality, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the artist accepts limits.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The artist's motivation—pursuing impossible precision while forgetting faces—drives consistent choices through crafting the light installation and finally accepting limitation. Internal contradiction operates throughout (remembering hands vs. forgotten faces), and the final renunciation of her knife for painting "nothing" carries visible cost. Slight deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("despair pressed into a coin") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she paints "nothing" and "lets the limits hold her," with clear cost in abandoning her lifelong pursuit. The accumulative lens holds as patterns of failed containment build to acceptance. Deduction for mild orientation delay (the oak library context emerges gradually) and some causality softness around how the coin's indentations become her blueprint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hollow oak library with its wound-like shelves and sap-mildew scent creates visceral atmosphere that constrains choices (one night before demolition). The glass ceiling installation transforms space into sky, and sensory details (charred fragment, pillow damp with sap) charge the ending. Strong integration of setting as both physical space and metaphor for containment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether meaning can be held/captured—escalates from portraits to library to accepting limits. The demolition deadline creates coherent pressure, and her choice to stay as the ceiling collapses shows agency with cost. Under the accumulative lens, the deepening works through pattern (faces→sky→nothing) though the middle section's escalation could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the impossibility of containment—faces that slip "like smoke in a net," the guild's failed attempt to hold the infinite, light that cannot be kept. The final image of painting "nothing" offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior attempts at capture. Exceptional integration without stating the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with selective perception ("fractally precise," "the library was a wound") and controlled rhythm that modulates with intensity. The lyric mode's purposeful compression works, though some moments edge toward purple prose ("ink the color of the hush before demolition"). POV remains stable with character-specific ways of noticing through artist's lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and high information density, but several overwriting issues: mixed metaphors ("library was a wound," "river of gold"), elevated diction that occasionally strains ("the sky wrote itself across their pages"). Some template patterns in the ending sequence. These don't touch closure directly but accumulate enough to limit the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face-blindness with artistic precision creates an original angle on creative limitation. The concept of "mirroring sky inside walls" and the progression from faces to sky to nothing shows genuine ingenuity. Risk-taking in the lyric structure and acceptance of failure as resolution elevates beyond typical workshop pieces.</comment>
