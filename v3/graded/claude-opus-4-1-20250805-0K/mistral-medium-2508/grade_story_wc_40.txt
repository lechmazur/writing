<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's obsession with the crystal and his shift from passive observation to active collaboration shows clear motivation with embodied tension ("fingers hovering," "breath shallow"). The woman's arrival forces a choice that forecloses his solitary path with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("adrift in a hush so profound it hummed") that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through crystal distortions building to the revelation that "growth hadn't stopped. It had gone underground." The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Elias takes the woman's hand, foreclosing solitary investigation with felt cost ("reticent no longer"). The pattern-teaching through crystal echoes pays off in the final image of whispered futures.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crystal's sonic reflections constrain Elias's investigation method and the library's suspended quiet becomes the very medium through which the future speaks. Dawn light through stained glass creating "fractured gold" mirrors the fractured language pattern. The chandelier's single working prism among dulled crystals provides specific, irreplaceable constraint that shapes the entire discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure builds through the crystal's revelations ("The pattern wasn't in the words. It was in the silences") to the woman's arrival confirming a wider phenomenon. The stakes deepen when "They're all doing it" transforms personal obsession into collective testimony. Cost becomes visible when Elias abandons his thirty-year solitary practice, though the final escalation could push harder against his reticence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ending reweights the entire premise: silence isn't absence but "a breath held before the next word." The crystal's distortions reveal growth continuing underground, transforming the death of dictionaries into gestation. The final image of a dictionary's spine cracking open and a child speaking untaught words offers resonant, non-literal answer to whether language can grow without documentation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Elias's academic precision noting "sonically reflective" properties and mapping distortion patterns. Voice modulates effectively from contemplative opening to urgent discovery ("His pulse roared in his ears"). The woman's weathered voice contrasts Elias's interior precision, though brief dialogue limits full distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The crystal was cold, almost vibrating, as if it had been waiting"). Rhythm varies naturally from long contemplative sentences to sharp fragments during discovery. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("hush so profound it hummed") and one instance of filter stacking ("He had noticed...how it bent").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise of language continuing to grow through sonic reflections after dictionaries cease transforms the extinction narrative into underground evolution. The specific synthesis of scholarly observation with mystical discovery through crystalline distortion feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric ending pays off as concrete images (cracking spine, untaught words) embody the conceptual shift.</comment>
