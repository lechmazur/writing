Looking at this story through an Accumulative/Textural lens, where density builds through carved lions, repeated imagery, and the widow's ritualistic practice until the final decision to keep one carving reweights her relationship to loss.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The widow's motivation crystallizes through embodied detail—"hands learning the language of absence," the knife "biting into the blank." Her final choice to keep the leaping lion shows earned evolution from containment to release, with visible cost in breaking her market routine.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she keeps the lion "Not as a ghost, but as a lesson." The accumulative structure builds through carving iterations to this decisive break in pattern, with cost visible in "One cut at a time" accepting perpetual letting-go.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The loft's "rain-beaded skylight" and "damp cedar" scent create lived-in specificity. The skylight constrains her work rhythm and charges the final image when "droplets caught the light and scattered it across the floor in rust-hued peace."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through carving iterations—from "lion's haunch" to "mid-leap"—each attempt deepening her confrontation with loss. The girl's question about lions "stepping out of the wood" forces articulation that tilts toward keeping the final piece.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the lions being "here and gone," never declarative but embodied in wood grain and incomplete forms. The final image of lions "always leaving" while she remains "knife in hand" offers resonant non-literal answer to loss without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "fractured light" and selective attention to craft details. Dialogue with the girl carries subtext about presence/absence, and the widow's compressed responses ("Because that's how they are") reveal character through restraint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"the kettle's whistle" marking time while echoing absence. Some filter-verb clustering ("she climbed," "she worked," "she sold") and occasional abstraction ("hauntingly practical rhythm") slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-as-craft with specific texture in the widow transitioning from seamstress to carver. The lions "dissolving into smoke" in dreams and the husband's death from "one breath held too long" avoid cliché through particularity.</comment>
