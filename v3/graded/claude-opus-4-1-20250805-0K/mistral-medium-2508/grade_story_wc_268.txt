<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Veythas's three-hundred-year resistance to the warnings followed by action creates genuine internal conflict with visible cost (sacrificing Lirien's name). His embodied exhaustion ("like shifting sand") and the final relief of the pretender show complex characterization. Minor deduction for the pretender's underdeveloped presence and somewhat abstract emotional processing in places.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change lands with Lirien's name as the price paid to unmake the false sovereign's claim. Causal lens holds: warnings lead to investigation, discovery demands sacrifice, sacrifice shatters the scepter and unmasks pretender. The cost is explicit and felt through the friendship's erasure. Slight deduction for the pretender's too-convenient relief lacking earlier setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The library's physical decay ("shelves sagging," "frayed like the hem of a god's discarded robe") and temporal distortion effectively constrain choices. The scepter's basalt materiality and the oculus's fractured light during transformation ground the climax. Deduction for underutilized spatial potential—the time-folding property could more actively pressure decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from ignoring warnings to recognizing the knife-edge threat to acting despite personal cost. The sacrifice of Lirien's name creates genuine trade-off with visible price. Minor deduction because the pretender's admission deflates some earned tension, though the cost to Veythas remains intact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of truth's cost emerges organically through the ink that "ate through lies" and the scepter that cracks "from the weight of a truth too long denied." The final inscription reweights the entire narrative without moralizing. The pretender's relief adds complexity to power's burden.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with mythic register ("diminutive titan," "carved from obstinate stone") and controlled rhythm that modulates with intensity. The prose breathes during reflection and tightens during action. Minor deduction for occasional elevation that slightly exceeds Veythas's established perspective ("celestial dance" feels external).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong imagery and varied syntax create momentum, particularly in the climactic sequence. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional redundancy ("quiet authority"/"unpretentious" overlap) and two instances of abstract telling that could be more embodied ("gracefully, as all things must").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy elements through specific details like iron gall ink that creates temporal messages and the unnamed library. The concept of sacrificing a name to unmake power offers genuine originality. The pretender's relief subverts expectations though could be more thoroughly developed.</comment>
