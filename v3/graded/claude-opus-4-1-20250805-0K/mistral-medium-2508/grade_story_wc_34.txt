<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The balladeer's motivation to translate silence and encode unspoken needs is grounded in his grandmother's legacy and curse of being "seldom-heard," driving his choice to refuse the ghost's possession. Internal conflict manifests physically through the bolt plate's heat and his trembling breath as contradictory impulses (helping vs. self-preservation) act simultaneously. The final renunciation carries visible cost as he walks away leaving "no prints," having foreclosed connection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through graffiti symbols, the ghost's answers, and the bolt plate's warmth until the final slam creates decisive change—the ghost dissolves and transfers to the valley child. Cost is legible in the balladeer's "raw throat with words he'd never sing" and his shadowless departure. The constraint of encoding rather than singing shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The misty courtyard floating above clouds creates atmospheric pressure while the bolt plate constrains choices—its heat forces the final decision. Sensory detail is selective (ozone, wet silk air, static hum) and filtered through the balladeer's unique perception. The graffiti that "ripped" and stone "peeling back like paper" grounds the supernatural in tactile reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from encoding messages to the ghost wanting "into him," forcing the crucial choice between absorption and refusal. The balladeer's agency drives the resolution through his final encoded rest symbol and bolt plate slam. Cost is visible in his empty hands, raw throat, and the child now marked to continue the work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the inheritance of unspoken needs—from grandmother's pressed flowers to the balladeer's graffiti to the valley child reaching for chalk. The final image of "silence was enough" resonantly answers whether connection requires possession. The work being "never really done" resists tidy resolution while honoring the cost of translation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through synesthetic awareness ("fingers driftingly alert," hearing "what others don't") and selective attention to encoded meanings. Prose rhythm accelerates during the ghost's manifestation then deliberately slows for the quiet departure. No dialogue maintains the thematic emphasis on non-verbal communication.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The courtyard floated above the clouds like a forgotten server room"). Some metaphor mixing occurs ("ghost in code" as "fragment" that later "unraveled") but doesn't obscure meaning. Minor scaffold appears in "The balladeer smiled, somewhere beyond the clouds" which tells rather than embodies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of encoding art, supernatural possession, and inherited silence creates a fresh angle on ghost stories. The specific detail of the flower press bolt plate as both relic and active tool transforms familiar elements. Risk-taking through the quiet refusal ending and transfer to an unseen child heightens stakes without conventional confrontation.</comment>
