<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Daniel's erasure-driven collecting compulsion builds through concrete embodied details (fingers tracing steel, label "humming against his palm"), with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in his need to gather versus dissolve. The final choice to press fragments into steel and step forward costs him literal existence, earned through prior establishment of his ghostlike state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as fragments layer into density, culminating in Daniel pressing his collected pieces into the labyrinth's heart—a Resonant Reconfiguration where erasure becomes absorption. Cost is unmistakable: "the water closed behind him without a ripple" signals complete dissolution, while "Some poisons were meant to be absorbed" reprices his collecting as intentional self-poisoning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The labyrinth physically constrains movement ("alleys between containers narrowing or vanishing"), while sensory hierarchy reflects Daniel's erasure (hearing "layers" others miss, containers "warm as if breathing"). The final crack in decaying steel where he presses his bundle charges the ending—environment literally absorbs him.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from collecting a label to gathering stories to finding his own crossed-out name, each fragment deepens his erasure. The tide flooding "higher than usual" forces final navigation through water, with cost visible as Daniel chooses absorption over persistence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the poison label's evolution from warning to metaphor ("some histories were too bitter to swallow whole") to final acceptance ("Some poisons were meant to be absorbed"). The ending reweights collection as intentional self-destruction without stating this moral, letting the water's closing "without a ripple" carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout ("salt and rust," hearing port rhythm as "layers"), with controlled modulation as Daniel moves from observer to participant. Minor drift toward elevated register in final paragraphs ("talisman," "undeniable pressure") slightly exceeds established lexicon but rhythm control under pressure remains strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("Container 47-B held a man once"—worldbuilding, atmosphere, thematic echo). Some template cadence in middle sections ("Daniel had," "Daniel would," "He began") and occasional register elevation ("syrupy," "labyrinth's maw") but propulsion remains clear through to the charged final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic error with physical erasure, where a death certificate mistake grants "odd clarity" to see what others overlook. The concept of collecting fragments of others' memories while losing one's own offers non-obvious angle, though execution occasionally reaches for elevated diction that slightly undermines authenticity.</comment>
