<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—measuring frequencies becomes a desperate extraction before dissolution. The vow recognition triggers genuine trembling and the final choice to step onto the bridge carries visible cost (library dissolving behind him). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("extraction: to conjure meaning") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear accumulative/textural lens with density increase toward the woman's appearance and invitation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias steps onto the bridge, library dissolving (visible cost), reaching for connection. The "vow kept" and world remaking itself provides felt transformation with legible before/after.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen library constrains every choice—ice shelves collapse, forcing faster work; the luminous vows require specific tools (lantern slide) to measure. The bridge of light/ice at closure directly emerges from the setting's logic. Sensory hierarchy strong: "ozone and old paper," "quartz hush pressing against ears."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation through accumulative pressure: library groaning, shelves collapsing, time running out drives Elias to work faster, then discover personal connection in the vows. The final choice to step forward onto the uncertain bridge while the library dissolves shows clear cost and agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the luminous vows as preserved promises—"invitations" not just records. The ending transforms measurement into participation, keeping a vow rather than cataloguing them. The world remaking itself "in the quiet" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "gently meticulous rhythm," attention to frequencies and light. Some elevated diction ("luminous vows," "edge of oblivion") fits the lyrical mode but occasionally drifts from Elias's orderly perspective. Clean POV maintenance throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm shifts. Some overwriting in figurative density ("forgotten breath," "bleeding light," "frostbitten leather") and occasional abstract phrasing ("extraction: to conjure meaning"). Template cadence appears briefly ("He held...He adjusted...He worked") but doesn't pervade.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archive/library with emotional preservation—vows as light frequencies is unexpected. The transformation from measuring to participating, from observer to vow-keeper, feels earned. The frozen library as both repository and grave adds conceptual depth.</comment>
