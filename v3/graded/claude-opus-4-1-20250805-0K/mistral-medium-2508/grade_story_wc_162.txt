<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("featherly determined" physicalized effectively) and contradictory impulses acting in scene when Elias both wants to scream at Liora and understands her necessity. The final choice to join her rather than extract her shows earned character change with visible cost. Slight deduction for Liora's precocious wisdom that borders on convenient child-sage trope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently with density increase toward the sinkhole revelation as Resonant Reconfiguration. The logbook codes, corn husk boat, and firefly patterns accumulate to reweight the maze's meaning from confusion-engine to threshold-finder, with Elias's descent marking visible cost. Orientation anchored cleanly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The maze architecture and sinkhole-as-sacred-center constrain choices effectively, particularly how the grain patterns guide Elias to the hidden note. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("air shimmered like a drifting prism"). The terrace's humming wood and firefly-lit underground create atmospheric pressure that shapes the final descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from missing child to understanding thresholds must be crossed alone, with the maze's true center revelation deepening pressure. Elias's agency drives discovery through following wood grain and interpreting the note. Cost is visible when he chooses descent over extraction, though the resolution's ease slightly reduces tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the maze-as-life metaphor without explicit statement. The final image of Elias climbing down while "the ladder held" resonates as acceptance of necessary distances in parent-child relationships. "Some doors only open when you stop looking" gains weight retrospectively when Elias stops searching conventionally.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with architectural/analytical vocabulary ("calculated to make losers question," "analyzing the way the fibers curled"). Controlled psychic distance shifts effectively from external search to intimate understanding. Minor deduction for Liora's dialogue occasionally exceeding plausible child register ("Some thresholds need to be crossed alone").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong rhythm variation and information density, particularly in descriptive passages ("like a bird deciding whether to take flight"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("featherly determined" appears twice, "fractured hush") without clear pattern-teaching. Template cadence emerges briefly in the sinkhole discovery sequence but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of parent-child separation anxiety through maze-as-threshold concept, avoiding typical lost-child resolution. The inversion where the child teaches the parent about necessary distances shows non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking in the mystical firefly underground pays off thematically without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
