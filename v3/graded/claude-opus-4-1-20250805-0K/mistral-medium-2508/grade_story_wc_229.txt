I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric's rigorous standards.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation crystallizes through embodied contradiction—pressing cool glass while holding warm cork, exhaling lavender to beckon boats. The cork as mother's inheritance anchors his belief system concretely. Minor deduction for Harkin's transformation feeling slightly rushed, though his shift from skepticism to recognition ("been shouting his whole life") lands with emotional specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens dominates—the story builds through sensory accretion (vibrations, scent, cork's warmth) toward Resonant Reconfiguration when Harkin pockets the cork "like a secret." Cost manifests in "the clean, bright ache of dawn" and Harkin's shoulders sagging. Orientation anchors clearly (lighthouse, dawn, Elias/Harkin). Deduction for the boats' return feeling slightly convenient despite the whisper mechanism.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse's "iron ribs humming" and "vibrations" function as micro-setting that constrains method—Elias must work through the structure's resonance. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's priorities: scent over sound, vibration over sight. The dead garden returning through jasmine scent charges the ending. Minor deduction for underutilizing the cobalt/bruise imagery after opening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on proving whispers' power over shouts, with Elias's method creating tension through its delicacy ("knife screams when it parts flesh cleanly"). The boats' gradual turn provides measured escalation. However, external opposition remains minimal—Harkin's skepticism dissolves too easily, and the fishermen's return lacks concrete resistance or cost beyond vague "strange dreams."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through contrast—whispers versus shouts, tenderness versus force—without explicit moralizing. The cork as purification vessel transforms from physical to metaphorical organically. "The world, for once, leaned in to listen" resonates without stating thesis. Final image of tending future gardens extends theme beyond immediate resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic blending—"vibrations of intent," "scent of crushed lavender." Prose modulates effectively from lyrical meditation to concrete action. Voice maintains consistency through metaphorical density ("lighthouse stood like a bruise," "oil still clung to the wick like a half-spoken promise"). Minor repetition in "vibrations" but serves accumulative pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong figurative control with purposeful density—metaphors cohere around communication/resonance. Information density high, most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some filter-verb accumulation ("Elias knew," "he watched," "he didn't wonder") slightly dulls immediacy in middle section. Syntax varies effectively, supporting rhythm shifts between reflection and action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse-keeper role with synaesthetic communication—beckoning through scent rather than light/sound. The cork as inherited purification vessel offers non-obvious angle on belief transmission. Transformation of "screaming tenderness" through the knife metaphor shows originality. Slightly derivative in the skeptic-converts arc, though execution elevates.</comment>
