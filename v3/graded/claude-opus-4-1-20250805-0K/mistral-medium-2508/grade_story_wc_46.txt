I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered images and metaphors about light, stillness, and transmission across generations, with density increasing toward the ending's transfer moment.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to preserve and transmit non-burning light is grounded in specific loss (Elias, grandmother) and embodied through tactile gem-polishing. The girl's arrival creates genuine agency through Liora's choice to pass on knowledge, though the girl herself remains somewhat thin as a character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres through the light/stillness metaphor building to the knowledge transfer as closure - a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "pearl of stillness" finds its next keeper with visible cost (the weight of understanding). The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, and the textural lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The grotto functions as more than setting - its serpentine walls and mist actively frame and constrain the intimate teaching moment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("coils of stone slick with the breath of the tide"), with the environment's quartz veins and exhaling mist participating in the final transfer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation operates through textural deepening - from personal practice to memory to the arrival of the student, with each layer adding weight to the central metaphor. The girl's request crystallizes Liora's purpose, though the stakes could be more viscerally felt beyond the metaphorical register.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the light/fire dichotomy and the concept of knowledge that "doesn't consume, only remembered." The ending reweights all prior material when the girl receives the glass - particularly strong is how "Tuesday" undercuts any false profundity while maintaining resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("not with fire, which devoured and demanded, but with light that lingered"). The perceptual signature is distinct - Liora notices texture, patience, geological time. Minor strain appears in elevated diction during memory sequences.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("trapped storm of green and gold") but suffers from occasional overwrought metaphor density and some template cadence in the memory section. The "serpentine" repetition works as pattern but borders on excessive. Information density is generally high with purposeful rhythm variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The central conceit of light-keepers who work through stillness rather than fire offers a fresh angle on mentorship stories. The specific synthesis of geological patience with human transmission feels earned, though some metaphorical constructions feel familiar ("grotto exhaled mist like a sleeping serpent").</comment>
