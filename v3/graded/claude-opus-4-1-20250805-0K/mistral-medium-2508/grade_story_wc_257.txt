<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong grief embodiment through concrete action (wire-twisting, sleepless crafting) and contradictory impulses (creating/releasing). The transformation from closed lily to open crane with distributed ritual shows earned change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("grief coiled tight") and the slightly convenient emotional resolution by winter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through repeated folding/leaving actions that build to communal grief-sharing. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lena shifts from solitary mourning to teaching others, with cost visible in "hollow eyes" and winter timeline. Orientation anchored early (observatory, jewelry maker, post-funeral). Minor deduction for somewhat predictable arc from isolation to connection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Observatory setting constrains through stillness/isolation, then opens through curtains metaphor. Copper flower and crane hollows function as micro-settings that enable transformation. Strong sensory work with "brass telescopes," "cracked glass," moonlight angles. Setting evolution from closed dome to open curtains mirrors internal shift effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (processing grief through craft) established early and deepens through discovery of mentor's lesson. Escalation through accumulation: pendant→stencil→crane→flower→twelve cranes→community teaching. Cost visible in "hands didn't ache" implying prior pain, and winter timeline showing sustained effort. Agency through renunciation of solitary grief-work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete objects (artificial flower that "lasts," hollow cranes "meant to hold light"). The curtains metaphor effectively layers revelation/concealment without becoming heavy-handed. Final image of woman learning creases resonates backward to reweight all prior folding. Strong subtext in "genuinely artificial" paradox.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with appropriate psychic distance shifts. Voice modulates effectively from tight grief to gradual opening. Strong perceptual signature in craft-focused noticing (wire tension, paper precision). Dialogue carries authentic mentor wisdom without exposition. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("reliquary," "surgical precision") slightly outside grieving craftsperson's immediate lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful repetition (folding, leaving, illuminating). Information density high in discovery sequence. Some overwriting in metaphorical sections ("shadows...were not of wings, but of vines") and occasional abstract phrasing ("grief...was a stencil, a coordinate"). Template cadence in "She + verb" constructions through middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-as-craft with origami ritual distribution. The hollow crane as light-holder is genuinely inventive. Transformation of mentor's cryptic teachings into communal practice feels earned. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure pays off, though the grief-to-community arc itself is somewhat familiar territory.</comment>
