I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as the piece builds through sensory detail and pattern recognition toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elias's intervention crystallizes the ship's path.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation flows from embodied perception—fingers tracing surfaces, reading vibrations through boots, interpreting water ripples—creating a coherent character whose blindness enhances rather than limits his expertise. The final choice to intervene carries clear cost (anonymity, energy) earned through thirty years of accumulated skill. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of his detection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres as sensory details build toward Elias's intervention, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration when the mist parts to reveal the golden corridor—a physical manifestation of corrected perception. Cost is visible in his anonymous departure and return to "a dozen other broken things." Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and the convenience of immediate array correction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mist functions as both obstacle and medium, while water becomes Elias's diagnostic tool—setting elements that directly enable and constrain his choices. The depot's industrial texture (anchor chains, gas lamps, cobblestones) grounds the steampunk atmosphere authentically. The water barrel's dual function as lens and mirror elevates setting beyond description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure builds through accumulation: detection through water, diagnosis through Lumen, the crowd's oblivious cheers creating urgency. The intervention carries cost—Elias works anonymously, receives no credit, returns to endless repairs. The tightening from detection to action to withdrawal tracks cleanly, though the resolution feels slightly too smooth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between seen/unseen, recognition/anonymity, with Elias's blindness becoming insight. The final image of him returning to broken things while the ship departs crystallizes the cost of expertise without acclaim. The water as medium for truth and the parted mist as revelation avoid heavy-handedness while maintaining resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical precision filtered through tactile perception—"feedback," "refraction," "hairline fracture"—creating a distinct perceptual signature. The prose modulates effectively from contemplative opening to urgent intervention to quiet return. Captain's single line of dialogue carries appropriate authority and recognition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong sensory density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The mist clung...like a second skin"). Rhythm varies naturally between long descriptive passages and short decisive actions. Minor deductions for occasional over-density in figurative language ("like whispers through a crowded room") and slight repetition in tactile descriptions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The blind artisan who sees through alternative perception offers a fresh angle on the savant archetype. The steampunk setting with crystalline navigation arrays and mechanical hummingbirds creates specific texture. The choice to remain anonymous rather than claim credit resists expected arcs while maintaining emotional truth.</comment>
