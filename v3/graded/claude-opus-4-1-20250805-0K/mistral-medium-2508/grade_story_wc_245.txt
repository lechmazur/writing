<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to navigate grief through the stillpoint is clear and embodied through sensory absorption of languages. The internal journey from raw grief to mapped understanding shows genuine transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "uncharted depths" that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the stillpoint discovery and resonant reconfiguration when Elian internalizes the stillpoint as navigational capacity. The closure lands with felt cost as grief becomes "mapped" rather than erased. Slight dock for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the ultrasonic forest concept.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest functions as both setting and constraint, with trees' frequencies absorbed through skin shaping Elian's navigation. The platinum ring's warmth/cooling provides spatial choreography, and the bone discovery charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects blindness authentically through sound and touch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from following musical trails to the stillpoint's revelation as a moment rather than place, forcing Elian to internalize navigation. The pressure coheres through accumulative sensory absorption until the forest "exhales" and grants the hidden melody. Cost is legible when grief transforms from raw wound to mapped terrain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of blindness as sight and the stillpoint as internal compass rather than destination. The bone's "remember" and Elian leaving it for the next seeker creates resonance without moralizing. The final image of walking into dawn with "hands empty, heart full" offers a non-literal answer to navigating loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic language absorption (salt/copper) and navigation by sound/touch. Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm, particularly in "He didn't walk so much as *unfold*." No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice remains coherent through pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "languages he could taste" and "the space between a held breath and its release." Deductions for repetitive "He [verb]" structures in the final third and some abstract phrasing ("uncharted depths," "quiet fire"). Information density is high but occasional redundancy appears in the ending sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synesthetic mapmaker navigating grief through an ultrasonic forest offers fresh synthesis. The stillpoint as internal navigation rather than destination transforms the quest trope meaningfully. Some familiar elements (compass, forest heart) prevent higher scoring despite the original sensory conceit.</comment>
