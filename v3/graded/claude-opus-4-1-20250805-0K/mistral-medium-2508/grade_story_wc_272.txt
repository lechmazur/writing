<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from artist seeking to capture light to becoming "the canvas" and "the brushstroke" shows genuine character evolution with visible cost. Her internal conflict between holding/releasing manifests concretely through the tarot reconstruction, and the final surrender carries emotional weight. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("luminescent ache") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where Elara's dissolution into the dark reweights the entire narrative from failure to necessary transformation. The cost is felt through the lighthouse's consumption and her loss of individual form. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, library, Elara as artist) establish early and the pattern of fragmentation-to-wholeness holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The collapsing library and dissolving lighthouse function as active constraints that force Elara's choice to "unmake" rather than escape. Sensory details like "salt and old parchment" and "ozone and wet ink" create atmosphere while the pressing walls literally shape the narrative's urgency. The environment transforms from container to participant, earning high integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as walls close in and the library's "hunger" intensifies, forcing Elara from reconstruction to dissolution. The dominant stake—whether to resist or embrace unmaking—tightens through physical compression and the tarot's transformation. Cost is visible in her loss of artistic identity to become "part of the story."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of necessary dissolution emerges organically through concrete images: broken frames, unraveling threads, fragments becoming constellations. The final image of floating fragments "suspended in the luminescent ache" offers a non-literal answer about wholeness through brokenness without moralizing. The recurring question "What do you fear in the dark?" pays off with embodied acceptance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm that modulates from contemplative to urgent as walls press closer. The rhetorical questions function as character-specific perception, and free indirect style maintains intimacy. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("luminescent ache") that slightly exceeds the established voice's natural lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong imagistic prose with purposeful compression and varied syntax, but "luminescent ache" appears three times creating mild repetition. Some abstract phrases like "necessary dark" and occasional filter constructions ("she needed to descend") slightly reduce immediacy. Information density generally high with most lines serving multiple purposes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse-as-body, library-as-consciousness, and art-as-dissolution offers a fresh angle on creative destruction. The tarot transformation from divination tool to "map of fractures" shows specific innovation. Risk-taking in the lyric mode and abstract ending heightens stakes while maintaining coherence.</comment>
