I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through layered exchanges and metaphorical transformations of the moon rock, with closure arriving through a resonant reconfiguration where Lena releases the object and her pattern of running.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's motivation as someone who "made herself useful" to navigate reciprocal exchanges is consistent and drives the story. The final choice to leave the rock shows earned character change through accumulated exchanges. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("desperate jocularity") without sufficient embodiment in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lena's release of the moon rock and acceptance of motion without running reweights the entire reciprocal system. The accumulative structure coheres well with each exchange building toward the final understanding that "the cure wasn't in the holding. It was in the passing." Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the virologist subplot's true nature.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The disused railway station with its "ghosts of timetables" effectively frames the story's exploration of connection and transit. Setting details like the offerings on the tracks and the kudzu-buried freight car constrain discovery. The flatbed truck as pseudo-train cleverly extends the railway metaphor through closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from finding Dr. Carter to understanding the deeper system of reciprocal connection. The revelation that the cure is "just a list of names" effectively reframes the quest. The final transformation where Lena stops running carries emotional weight, though the middle section could use slightly more pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the moon rock's transformations and the railway ledger metaphor. The cure for loneliness being found in "passing" rather than "holding" resonates without stating a moral. The final line "Maybe it was just the motion" maintains productive ambiguity while the world-as-ledger concept reweights all prior exchanges.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with evocative phrases like "slow-motion earthquake" and "desperate jocularity." Some register elevation in places ("catalyze things," "reciprocity") slightly strains the established voice. Dialogue feels natural when present, though limited. The perceptual signature of someone who sees the world through transactions is maintained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong images like "swallowing its own echoes." Some abstract phrasing ("the real, gnawing absence") and occasional overwriting ("hollow out," "forger, a poet, and...the last person") create minor density issues. The closing sequence maintains good momentum despite these occasional indulgences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of disaster relief logistics with mythic object-passing and railway nostalgia creates an original emotional landscape. The cure for loneliness being a transit ledger is genuinely inventive. The story transforms familiar quest elements through its specific lens of reciprocal exchange and the metaphor of transit as connection.</comment>
