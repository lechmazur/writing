<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's split consciousness drives genuine internal conflict through embodied details (the jar pulsing, blood ritual) and his final choice to merge carries visible cost. The transformation from "numb half-life" to "crushing, glorious *all*" earns its emotional weight through prior causality, though Veyra remains more functional than fully realized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael merges his split selves, paying the visible cost of pain and risk to defeat numbness—the final image of stepping "into the dawn" with a "whole" heart reweights the opening's fractured state. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pressure builds through layered details (jar pulses, blood ritual, dojo rising) toward this crystallized moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating dojo and storm-wracked valley establish immediate atmosphere while the jars constrain Kael's central choice—the blood ritual using "metal as the Schism's blade" makes setting inseparable from resolution. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly though some world-building remains gestural ("Emperor's memory-wipes").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from passive waiting to active merger as the custody hearing deadline and Emperor's rewriting history create time pressure that forces Kael's decision. The blood ritual carries visible cost ("pain lanced through his skull") and his choice forecloses the path of remaining split, though the Emperor's threat could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The central metaphor of split consciousness elegantly explores wholeness versus safety, with the final line "we defeat the numbness" offering a non-literal answer that reweights all prior fragmentation. The merger doesn't resolve into false unity but embraces "crushing, glorious *all*" of unified experience with its inherent pain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent mythic-poetic register with selective details like "moss-slicked edges" and "amber fluid," though dialogue occasionally defaults to functional exposition ("Custody hearing's in three days"). The perceptual signature of fragmented consciousness comes through in italicized thoughts and the visceral merger sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("storm-wracked valley," "tearing silk") but suffers from repetitive structures ("The dojo's wooden doors groaned open," "The dojo creaked," "The dojo rose higher") and some overwriting in metaphorical density. Filter constructions like "he felt the weight" and conceptual abstractions ("the weight of his own emotions") dull immediacy in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The clone custody battle premise transforms familiar split-self territory through specific world-building (monks' Schism, Emperor's memory-wipes) and the visceral detail of brains in jars. The merger through blood ritual offers a non-obvious resolution that feels earned rather than convenient.</comment>
