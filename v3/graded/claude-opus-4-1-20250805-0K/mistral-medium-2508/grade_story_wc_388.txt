<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's skepticism and pattern-seeking drive clear choices throughout, with internal contradiction between disbelief and what he witnesses creating genuine tension. The final reach toward the "cure" shows earned transformation from debunker to believer, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("meaning" pushed back) rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through pattern recognition, static air, lead-lined pit, and diamond discovery to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias becomes "refracted" into multiple selves. The cost is visible—his disappearance and transformation—though the "garden/fertilizer" revelation feels slightly rushed in execution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard with glowing fruit and the stillpoint's unnatural calm create vivid constraint on choices, particularly the lead-lined pit and shattered vials that build archaeological pressure. Environment directly shapes the final transformation when "something green and glistening" emerges from beneath.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds from investigation through physical resistance at the stillpoint to visions that reframe the entire Liquidation, forcing Elias to choose between exposure and participation. The cost lands clearly—his literal dissolution/multiplication—though the "cure vs curse" reversal could use one more beat of resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of comfortable lies versus dangerous truths emerges organically through Elias's career arc and the diamond's revelation, with the "garden/fertilizer" metaphor reweighting his life's work. The ending's ambiguity ("You're next") maintains complexity, though the explicit statement "every lie...had been fertilizer" edges toward thesis declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature through Elias's investigative lens ("cracked goggles," pattern-seeking, professional skepticism) with effective modulation as certainty breaks down. Some register drift occurs in peak moments ("unspooling," "meaning pushed back") that feels elevated beyond the established pragmatic voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("knee-deep in myth," "fingers sticky with sap") but several abstract constructions weaken immediacy: "pushed back with meaning," "something older," "ghost of static." The filter-verb cluster around discovery ("he saw," "he reached," "he knelt") dulls a crucial beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic investigation with the concept of lies as literal fertilizer for transformation creates genuine surprise. The "stillpoint as valve" and multiplied-self ending offer non-obvious inflections, though the conspiracy-debunker-finds-real-mystery frame is somewhat familiar.</comment>
