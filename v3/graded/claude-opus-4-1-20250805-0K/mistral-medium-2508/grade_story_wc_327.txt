<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Veyra's copper-veined inheritance and ancestral hunger create clear motivation that drives her fatal choice to answer the echoes. The moment where "the copper in her veins burned with the same hunger that had driven her ancestors" effectively shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. However, the transformation into echo happens too quickly without sufficient embodied struggle, and her final realization "You were never meant to understand" arrives as convenient wisdom rather than earned through dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks building toward Veyra's absorption into the canyon's echoes—a Decisive Change with clear cost. The closure lands powerfully with "echoes are just sounds that have forgotten how to die" reweighting the entire premise. Minor deduction for the slightly rushed transformation sequence where causality accelerates beyond the established pace.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon setting actively constrain Veyra's choices—the towers "sing" and trap her with echoes "thick as chains." Sensory detail like "the texture of crumbling parchment, the sound of a blade dragged across old wounds" creates visceral atmosphere. The starlings' flight patterns function as both setting element and plot mechanism, charging the final image where they "still dance above the canyon."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from translation attempt to existential absorption as the diamond reveals its true curse—not for listeners but answerers. The reversal when "the echoes twisted, no longer passive reflections but something alive" effectively tightens pressure. However, Veyra's agency diminishes in the final transformation; she becomes more victim than agent, though her ancestral hunger does drive the fatal choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of untranslatable knowledge emerges powerfully through the concrete image of sounds that "were not meant to be revived." The final meditation on echoes as "sounds that have forgotten how to die" offers a resonant, non-literal answer about the persistence of lost languages. The starlings' transformed patterns becoming "a language of their own" creates layered meaning about communication beyond human comprehension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through focus on texture and sound—"the grit of consonants lost to time, the silk of vowels unspoken." The prose modulates effectively with pressure, shifting from measured observation to urgent fragments like "The canyon inhaled." Minor deduction for slight register elevation in peak moments ("untranslatable," "unharnessable") that occasionally exceeds Veyra's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong moments like "copper-veined storyteller" and "flawed diamond at her throat" demonstrate purposeful compression. However, several paraphrase loops diminish momentum: "translate it all, even the untranslatable" restates without advancement, and the ending cycles through multiple variations of absence. The filter-heavy sequence "She tried to run...turned to ice" dulls immediacy at a crucial beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of a cursed diamond that punishes answerers rather than listeners offers genuine surprise that feels inevitable in hindsight. The synthesis of translation, echo, and absorption creates a non-obvious take on language death. The risk of sustaining mystery through accumulative structure rather than explicit causality heightens stakes while maintaining clarity at closure.</comment>
