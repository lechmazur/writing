<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's characterization succeeds through concrete embodiment of his shadow-laced nature and the earned progression from passive peacekeeper to active intervener. The fragment's effect on him—showing rather than soothing—creates genuine internal conflict that drives his decisive choice to step onto the ice. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("the space where doubt lived") and occasional therapy-speak ("map empathy onto action").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Charged Poise closure—Elias stepping forward as the mirrors shatter crystallizes his transformation with clear cost (abandoning his observer role). The fragment-vision-mirror pattern accumulates effectively toward this reconfiguration. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some causality softness around how exactly the visions work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse-orchard-ice setting constrains choices excellently—the precarious cliff location and groaning ice create genuine environmental pressure that shapes Elias's final decision. Vivid sensory details ("salt-cracked earth," "wax and damp wool") establish atmosphere while the mirrors serve as functional setting elements that enable the visions and shatter at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate appropriately under the textural lens as visions accumulate urgency about the child's imminent danger, forcing Elias from observation to intervention. The cost is legible—abandoning his shadow-role to become "foolish enough to step onto the ice." Minor deduction because the child herself never appears on-page, keeping some tension theoretical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between observation and intervention, with the final image of shattered mirrors resonating as Elias moves from fragmented glimpses to whole action. The reconstitution motif works on multiple levels without explicit moralizing. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract "map empathy onto action" phrasing that edges toward theme-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with Elias's specific way of noticing ("like old men gripping walking sticks") and consistent psychic distance. The lyrical voice maintains coherent texture through varied syntax and rhythm. Deduction for occasional register drift into elevated diction ("methodical warning to ships that never came anymore") that slightly exceeds the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("roots tangled in the salt-cracked earth above the shifting ice floes below") and good information density. Deductions for scattered overwriting ("trapped screams," "bones clicking"), some filter-verb clustering ("he'd glimpsed," "Elias knew"), and occasional abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The shadow-laced peacekeeper who must abandon passive observation offers a fresh angle on the helper-figure trope. The fragment showing rather than soothing inverts expected crystal ball mechanics cleverly. The specific detail of mirrors at "odd angles" and the child offering herself to the ice create memorable particularity.</comment>
