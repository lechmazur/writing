I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through recurring images (sea glass, stones, letters) and pattern intensification rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from isolation to connection is earned through accumulated gestures—the daily glass ritual, stone stacking, and eventual written reply. His internal contradiction between wanting solitude and needing connection plays out through embodied actions rather than stated feelings. The final choice to stay and build carries visible cost (letting the skiff rot).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly: Elias moves from death-haunted isolation to life-affirming connection through the accumulated weight of letters, stones, and glass. The cost is legible in "The skiff would rot at the dock. / Let it." The accumulative structure coheres as each element (glass, letters, stones) deepens the central question of safety and connection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting constrains choices effectively—the broken lamp creates the isolation, the spiral staircase marks reluctance, the lantern room becomes a sacred space for connection. Sensory details like "rust and old wax, the ache of light that used to be" and stones that "hummed when the wind hit them right" make the environment tactile and alive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: from ritualistic glass placement to burning letters to finally climbing the stairs and writing back. The pressure isn't external conflict but the weight of isolation versus connection, with each letter and stone raising the emotional cost. The final commitment to stay and "build a door" crystallizes the choice between safety in isolation and risk in connection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme emerges through concrete images: "safety wasn't the absence of storms, but the hands that passed the light between them." The sea glass transforms from private ritual to shared symbol, the stones from markers to communication. The final image of the dead lamp but living light offers a non-literal answer about how connection transcends physical infrastructure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical compression with distinctive constructions like "guided his supply skiff through the mist like a man tracing a scar" and "the kind of smile that doesn't need sound." The perceptual signature focuses on texture and weight—glass edges, stone arrangements, held breaths—fitting Elias's tactile relationship with isolation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, though some figurative density borders on overwriting ("the ache of light that used to be," "salt pork," "teeth and salt"). Information density is high—most sentences advance both external action and internal state. Some metaphor mixing ("held note" appears multiple times with different vehicles) creates minor friction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of lighthouse keepers communicating across time through objects and letters offers fresh specificity. The transformation of safety from isolation to connection through accumulated gestures feels earned rather than convenient. The specific detail of stone-stacking as language and the glass as transgenerational talisman elevates familiar lighthouse isolation tropes.</comment>
