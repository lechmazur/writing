<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The librarian's motivation to vitalize escaped dreams is clear and consistent, with internal contradiction between preserving order and allowing freedom crystallizing in her choice to let the dream dissolve. Her micro-choice to whisper "Stay" instead of returning the dream reveals values hierarchy with visible cost. Slight deduction for the dream-woman's underdeveloped agency and some abstract phrasing ("cipher of longing") that verges on label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through light/photography imagery building to the dream's dissolution. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the librarian chooses to let the dream fade rather than cage it, with visible cost in the "single watercolor smear" and her later salt-dampened pillow. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and maintains coherence, though the dream's exact nature could be clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The archipelago functions as active constraint—its "whispering" nature, black sand, and horizon "blurred like smeared charcoal" create the liminal space where dreams can be captured. The watercolor palette's transformation from pigment-holder to prism-shard container that refracts light "into something almost solid" directly enables the photography method. Environment and tools constrain the librarian's choices throughout, charging the final image of "dew—light made liquid."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: first attempt fails, second succeeds but reveals the dream's hunger, leading to the peaked choice between preservation and freedom. The cost is legible in the dream's dissolution and the librarian's physical response (salt tears, damp pillow). Some deduction for the dream-woman's limited agency and the slightly abstract nature of the central conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central tension between preservation and freedom, culminating in the paradox that "some stories weren't meant to be read. They were meant to be *lived*." The final image of the librarian dreaming of walking on water herself, becoming what she sought to capture, offers resonant answer without stating moral. The recurring light/water imagery and the palette's transformation from container to medium deepens thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "fingers stained with the ghosts of ink" and "net for dreams." Voice maintains lyric consistency through controlled rhythm and selective perception focused on light, texture, and ephemera. The dream-woman's dialogue is appropriately thin and desperate. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("luminous absence between dawn and memory") that slightly exceeds the established range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The palette flared—once, twice—like a match in a hurricane" simultaneously shows action, suggests fragility, and mirrors the dream's dissolution. Some figurative density in places ("whispering archipelago still hummed with the hush") but pattern is taught early. Slight deduction for occasional abstract phrasing and one instance of paraphrase ("some stories weren't meant to be read" concept restated).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of librarian-as-dream-hunter using photography to capture ephemeral stories transforms expected tropes. The specific method of using refracted light through prism shards to "stitch dreams into existence" is non-obvious and feels inevitable given the setup. Risk-taking in the lyric structure and the choice to let the dream dissolve rather than preserve it elevates stakes. The transformation of the librarian into what she hunted adds final originality.</comment>
