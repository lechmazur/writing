<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's compulsive pursuit despite personal cost creates genuine tension, with embodied details like "skin prickle" and the physical weight of memories returning. The memory eater wearing a friend's face delivers earned betrayal. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient final exchange lacking fuller embodiment of the confrontation's emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-break closure as the constellation "knitting itself back together" creates Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost ("heavy and bright as a starfall"). The fairy ring dissolving and memory restoration land with weight. Slight dock for the rushed final confrontation that could use one more beat to fully dramatize the reckoning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse with "glass bones and iron ribs" creates vivid constraint, and the fairy ring's iridescent residue functions as crucial detector. Setting actively shapes choices through water depth and the carved pedestal. Deduction for some atmospheric description ("drowned leviathan") that leans ornamental rather than constraining action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds from detection to personal memory loss to active confrontation, with the fairy ring's blue flare marking the decisive turn. The trade revelation ("trading" not just "stealing") deepens stakes effectively. Cost is visible in Elias's trembling hands and the weight of returned memories, though the final confrontation could show more immediate price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory as burden versus freedom emerges through concrete details—the "memory eater" offering "cleaner slates" resonates against Elias's compulsive preservation. The "spaces held open" concept reweights earlier gaps meaningfully. Minor deduction for the slightly pat final exchange that edges toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with academic-folklorist lens filtering observations ("chronically curious streak," technical mushroom details). Rhythm modulates well from methodical investigation to urgent discovery. Deduction for occasional register elevation ("drowned leviathan," "wishbone") that doesn't fully match Elias's established voice and some filter-verb clustering in memory sequences.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative moments like "black water," "jagged absence," and "waves dragging over glass." Information density is good with most sentences pulling double duty. Deductions for metaphor density in places ("drowned leviathan," "hollowed out like a gourd," "split like a wishbone") and slight repetition in memory-loss descriptions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The memory-as-trade concept offers a fresh take on the Faustian bargain, and the constellation fracture creates original worldbuilding. The friend-as-monster reveal lands effectively. Some elements feel familiar (sunken ruins, mushroom rings as portals) without full transformation through specificity.</comment>
