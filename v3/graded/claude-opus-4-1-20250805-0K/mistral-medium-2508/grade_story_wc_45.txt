<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's characterization as a "forgiving skeptic" who "believed in lies more easily than truths, but never held them against anyone" creates a distinctive psychological profile that drives her measured response to the supernatural. Her bone-setting expertise meaningfully informs her approach to "setting the world," though the brother's transformation lacks sufficient emotional cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Liora gains the ability to "set the world." The garden-bargain-restoration sequence maintains causality, but the brother's seamless return ("palms smooth and unmarked") undermines the cost that should accompany such transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The secret garden functions as a transformative space with visceral details ("vines heavy with fruit no one had ever tasted, flowers that pulsed faintly when touched"). The well's symbols that "made her teeth ache" and the changeling's "eyes like polished river stones" create an effectively uncanny atmosphere that constrains choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from discovering the tooth through the changeling encounter to the negotiated restoration, with Liora's "Turn them into stars / So we can find our way" representing agency through renunciation. However, the brother's effortless return deflates the established tension about transformation's price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bone-setting metaphor elegantly bridges physical and metaphysical repair, culminating in "She had always been good at setting bones. Now she knew how to set the world." The theme emerges through concrete particulars rather than statement, though the too-neat resolution slightly diminishes complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical control with distinctive perceptual signatures ("the air thick with the scent of crushed mint and something older, like iron left in the rain"). The dialogue between Liora and the changeling effectively carries subtext, though some passages drift toward elevated register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong imagistic precision but suffers from occasional overwriting ("the well water rose, black and silver, forming a map of constellations where the wounds had been") and template constructions. The final section's repetitive "She had always been..." structure creates unnecessary scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of changeling folklore with medical expertise through bone-setting creates genuine originality. The concept of wounds becoming navigational stars and the garden as a space for metaphysical bargaining transcends typical portal fantasy, though the resolution's tidiness reduces risk.</comment>
