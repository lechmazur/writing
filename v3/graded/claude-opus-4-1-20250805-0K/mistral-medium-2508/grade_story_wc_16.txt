<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her penance for past translation harm, with embodied tension in "fingers still vibrating with the language's pulse." The transformation from guilt-driven scholar to someone who "trusted the sound of her own voice" is earned through concrete action. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("carefully reckless") without sufficient embodied demonstration in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the archive transforms from tomb to living chorus, with visible cost in Elara's decade of penance and the shattered inkwell. The restoration of the Chorus creates a decisive before/after shift. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay and some causal looseness around how singing "in harmonic gaps" mechanically works.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail ("crushed violets and slow decay") and the archive functions as active constraint—the impending burning drives urgency. The glass inkwell's properties constrain Elara's method. Spatial choreography occasionally unclear during the transformation sequence, but the setting actively shapes choices throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear dominant stake (preventing archive destruction/restoring truth) with escalation through the emissaries' approach creating time pressure. The cost is visible in the shattered inkwell and Elara's physical transformation. However, the resolution feels slightly convenient—the archive protecting itself removes some agency from Elara's final choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of language as binding promises, with the archive as loom effectively reweighting the entire premise. The final image of "the thread, unbroken" and "truth, not as a blade, but as a bridge" resonates without moralizing. Slight deduction for occasional abstract philosophizing in the extended ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism and strong perceptual signature in how Elara experiences the archive. Some register drift into elevated diction ("monument to dead lies," "gestation") that occasionally strains the POV. The extended ending shifts into more distant, omniscient territory that weakens voice consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery, but the ending suffers from repetitive structure ("The point was...") and some paraphrase loops. Filter verbs cluster in emotional beats ("She knew, now"). Information density is high in the main narrative but dilutes in the extended coda with redundant thematic restatements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of language-as-reality with the extinct tongue that binds promises across time. The "sylph-touched indigo" that reveals truth on deceit is inventive. The transformation from passive archive to active loom shows genuine originality, though the extended ending retreats into safer, more conventional territory.</comment>
