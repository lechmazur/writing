I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and sensory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where past and present overlap.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to restore lost joy through light-painting is embodied through concrete actions (bottled light, film development, public display). The final choice to share the memory publicly carries visible cost—the film will dissolve by morning. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("grief so deep it felt like grief").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the projected orchard transforms the ruined space, making past joy briefly tangible with clear cost (the ephemeral nature of the projection). The accumulative build through fresco discovery → film development → public display creates coherent pressure. Orientation anchors established early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard setting constrains choices (abandoned, fog-bound, fruit no one dares eat) and charges the final transformation when it "no longer felt like a ruin." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("loam," "moss like memory," "liquid light"). The greenhouse studio and dead trees become active participants in the climactic projection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes build through textural accumulation: private discovery → studio experimentation → public sharing, with escalating emotional risk. The cost is legible—the projection's impermanence ("dissolving like sugar in rain") and Liora's acceptance of ephemeral beauty. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of permanence/impermanence, individual/collective memory, and art as restoration without false resolution. The final image of mixing new paints suggests ongoing creation despite loss. The knowledge network as collective memory reinforces the theme organically.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("paints mixed from captured light," "shadows blurred into dusk"). Perceptual signature strong—Liora notices through an artist's lens. Minor register elevation in places ("collective murk") but maintains coherence under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. Some overwriting in figurative density ("moss like a memory half-forgotten," "liquid ways") and occasional abstract phrasing. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light-painting, collective memory networks, and temporal overlay. The concept of painting with bottled light and using film to resurrect past joy feels specific and earned. Risk-taking in the lyric mode pays off, though some elements feel familiar (abandoned district, mysterious fog).</comment>
