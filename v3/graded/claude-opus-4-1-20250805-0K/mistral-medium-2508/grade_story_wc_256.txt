<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora's pilgrimage motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions with the lens and bells, though her internal conflict lacks the simultaneous contradictory impulses that would elevate the score. The final renunciation ("She left it there") carries visible cost as she abandons the physical artifact for a conceptual connection, earning the closure through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently as the piece builds through sensory accumulation ("hum filled the room," "shadows pulsed") toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Liora becomes "the space between the notes." The closure lands with felt cost as she leaves the bell behind, though the orientation anchors arrive slightly late (past 120 words).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The laboratory setting actively constrains and enables choices through the resonator, extinct recordings, and the lens's interaction with the brass dish. The "golden shadows" arranging into a path and the bell's appearance charge the final image, making the environment essential to closure rather than ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake of discovering "the texture of connection" deepens through Liora's manipulation of the lens, with one meaningful tightening when the hum transforms into "something like a voice." The cost becomes visible when she leaves the bell behind, though escalation could be stronger under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lens metaphor—connection isn't held but shaped—without explicit moralizing. The final image of Liora as "the space between the notes" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of connection, reweighting the pilgrimage concept effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm, though some passages drift into elevated diction ("the slow bloom of a question") that slightly exceeds Liora's established lexicon. The perceptual signature is distinct in how she experiences sound as texture and light, with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from template cadence in several passages ("She had come... She was... She would...") and abstract phrasing like "texture of connection" that recurs without added pressure. The filter-verb stack in "Liora knew the truth" and similar constructions dulls immediacy, though the final image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound archaeology with personal pilgrimage offers a fresh angle, particularly the lens-as-connection metaphor. However, the "laboratory of lost sounds" concept and some mystical elements ("golden shadows arranged themselves") lean toward familiar territory without full transformation through lived detail.</comment>
