I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and symbolic density toward a transformation that reweights meaning rather than following strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from passive receiver to active prophet is earned through accumulated pressure and contradictory impulses ("He wasn't just the needle anymore. He was the hand"). The internal conflict between serving the dawn or the dark plays out through concrete choices like sealing the portico then hurling the receiver through it. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in peak moments ("assembled from scraps of older myths") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves a Decisive Change as Elias transforms from listener to prophet, with visible cost in the world's transformation below ("It wouldn't know what hit it"). The accumulative structure coheres through radio frequencies, glass imagery, and the dawn/knife motif building to the final scalpel image. Orientation anchors arrive by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the "city that shouldn't exist yet" which never fully clarifies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico functions as both setting and constraint, evolving from barrier to lens to door to throne, directly shaping Elias's final choice. Sensory details like "air tasted of ozone and forgotten things" and "static hum through the bones" create visceral atmosphere. The observatory's isolation above clouds pressures the choice between allegiances.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating radio messages ("You are the hinge, little god") to the portico cracking to Elias's decisive action of hurling the receiver through the glass. The cost appears in the world transformation below and Elias's acceptance of his prophetic role. Some middle beats could tighten—the pressure plateaus briefly before the crack appears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the prophet-as-assembled-construct concept and the dawn-as-knife/scalpel progression, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of Elias unfolding the future with his hands resonates without stating meaning. The mirror/reflection motif effectively explores identity and transformation. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract "bones of old gods" which doesn't fully ground the thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with phrases like "carved this place from the ribs of the mountain" and consistent lyrical-prophetic voice. The italicized radio transmissions create effective dialogue-as-action. Minor issues with register elevation in places ("confluence of allegiances") that slightly exceed Elias's established lexicon during peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The pane was cold, older than the stars he charted"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("crown," "sermon," "throne" stacked too quickly) and mild template cadence in "He wasn't just... He was..." construction. The prose maintains momentum but occasional abstract phrasing ("assembled from scraps of older myths") reduces immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of a prophet assembled from radio frequencies and choosing between dawn's knife and darkness offers genuine freshness. The cobalt glass portico as lens/door/throne and the dawn-as-scalpel transformation feel earned and specific. Risk-taking in the lyrical-accumulative structure and ambiguous ending heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
