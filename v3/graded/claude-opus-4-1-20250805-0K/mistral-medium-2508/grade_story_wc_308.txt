<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The skimmer's motivation to preserve ancestral knowledge while facing extinction creates genuine internal tension, particularly in his choice to become "anchor" rather than flee. The arrowhead as embodied memory and his physical response to the flock's patterns show character through concrete detail. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "learning to navigate without moving" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through resonance patterns (stone/bone/echo) toward the Charged Poise ending where the skimmer becomes the anchor, with clear cost in accepting the hunter's presence. The transformation from observer to tower/echo lands with conceptual weight. Slight opacity around the Hollow Maw's exact nature doesn't damage closure but prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon function as active constraints—their echoes both warn and trap, while the arrowhead's vibrations against sternum become the sensing mechanism. "The canyon breathed" and tower groaning create lived environment. The setting directly enables the resolution strategy of becoming indistinguishable from the towers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds from observation to detection of anomaly to predator arrival, with the skimmer's response shifting from reading to binding himself to stone. The cost is clear: accepting proximity to the Hollow Maw rather than fleeing. The "movement as confession" insight crystallizes the stakes effectively under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "navigate without moving" and the preservation of lost knowledge, with the arrowhead accumulating meaning from relic to sensor to anchor. The final image of waiting to "teach the towers to sing" offers resonant answer without stating moral. Strong integration of stillness-as-survival with ancestral wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("jagged spires that hummed," "living map of black wings"). Some elevated diction ("historically reverent," "harmonic stone skimmer") occasionally strains but mostly serves the mythic register. The POV maintains consistent distance and the perceptual signature of reading vibrations is unique.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during tension. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("bruised twilight," "slithered through hollows") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete. Information density is high and most sentences do multiple jobs. Minor repetition of "pulse" concept without sufficient variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of navigation-through-stillness concept with the specific mechanism of reading bird patterns through stone vibration. The Hollow Maw as hunger-that-feeds-on-wandering-pulses offers non-obvious threat. The transformation of defensive stillness into active anchoring shows conceptual depth beyond surface novelty.</comment>
