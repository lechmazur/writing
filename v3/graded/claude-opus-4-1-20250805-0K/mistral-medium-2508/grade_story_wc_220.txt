<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rook's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like flexing claws and following instinct, with his transformation from body-finder to message-carrier earned through prior causality. The internal conflict between settlement rules and personal need creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of his final acceptance lacking more visceral embodiment in the dome sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Rook's transformation from finder of the dead to being found himself, with visible cost in his entombment. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and recurring motifs (leaf, cylinder, script) build toward the final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors land clearly by ~100 words. The closure's cost is felt through the vines tightening and Rook's willing surrender, though the conceptual weight slightly outpaces the visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The scrapyard and wasteland are vividly rendered through selective detail ("ribs of twisted metal," "wind carved spirals"), with the glass dome garden providing stark contrast. The leaf and cylinder function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Setting actively guides Rook's journey through the cylinder's riddle-map describing how "wind bent around certain rocks."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—bridging distance to find connection—escalates from curiosity through active pursuit to final surrender. The cylinder's revelation tightens options by revealing the woman's death while opening the paradoxical path to reunion. Cost is visible in Rook's entombment and transformation. The escalation could be stronger in the middle section where the journey feels slightly mechanical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor "Distance is a wound, but the wound can be a bridge," which the story literalizes without heavy-handedness. The final image of Rook becoming the next message-carrier offers a resonant answer to questions of connection and loss. The garden war concept provides fresh complexity to post-apocalyptic survival.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent lyric register with distinctive perceptual signature ("the wind's wild hush," "ribs of a gutted school bus"). The prose modulates effectively between external description and Rook's canine consciousness. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds a bloodhound's plausible lexicon ("tinted revelation," "symmetric satisfaction").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and selective detail, with effective rhythm in peak moments. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for scattered metaphor density that occasionally obscures clarity ("sky bled into the land in a tinted revelation") and minor template cadence in the closing sequence ("The dome hummed. The vines tightened.").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of a bloodhound finding connection rather than corpses offers genuine freshness, enhanced by the phonograph cylinder as message-carrier and the garden-in-wasteland reversal. The transformation of post-apocalyptic survival from resource wars to "garden wars" provides conceptual originality. The execution synthesizes familiar elements into something distinctive.</comment>
