<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from certainty-keeper to uncertainty-embracer is earned through concrete unraveling of borrowed doubts, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("didn't know how to welcome nuance into certainty"). The final choice to let dust settle on the lens carries visible cost—abandoning his twenty-year ritual. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around doubt/certainty that occasionally loses embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias shifts from rigid certainty to "protected vulnerability," with the lighthouse beam changing from steady guide to questioning pulse—cost visible in abandoning his polished routine. Accumulative/textural lens holds as details (shard whispers, unhooked threads, wind chimes) build pressure toward stance crystallization. The woman's arrival and staying provides external confirmation of internal change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse and its components (lens, beam, steps, rail) effectively constrain choices—Elias must physically unknot the cloak on the beach, the shard must be hung where wind can reach it. Wind chimes function as environmental oracle guiding action. Deduction for some abstract passages about doubt/certainty that lack sensory grounding, though key moments remain anchored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal routine disruption through confronting absorbed guilt to accepting fundamental uncertainty, with the shard's whispers forcing recognition: "You never unhooked from them." The physical unknotting of the cloak provides concrete cost as each thread dissolves. The woman's arrival raises stakes by offering witnessed vulnerability rather than isolation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the transformation of light from warning to question—"not by banishing dark, but by learning its shape." The cloak becoming quilt reweights the central metaphor from burden to "sacred heaviness of questions." Final image of Elias staying while the ship remains "neither lost nor found" offers resonant non-literal answer to certainty versus doubt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm shifts matching emotional intensity—shorter fragments during unknotting, longer meditation at closure. Some elevated diction ("gloriously, terribly unclear") fits the philosophical tone but occasionally drifts toward abstraction. Dialogue minimal but effective—the woman's "I'm here to help you carry yours" carries strong subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "doubt crept in like fog"/"wore their doubts like a cloak," repeated certainty/uncertainty abstractions. Strong moments of compression ("The woman stayed. The shard stayed hollow.") offset by occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages. Line-level craft solid but template phrases around light/dark and knowing/unknowing reduce freshness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The conscience-for-hire backstory offers fresh angle on guilt absorption, and the hollow mirror shard that listens rather than reflects inverts expectations effectively. Wind chimes as truth-tellers and the cloak-to-quilt transformation show genuine invention. Some philosophical abstractions about certainty/uncertainty feel familiar, preventing higher score.</comment>
