<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina's motivation through pyramid scheme trauma and maternal abandonment creates clear causality for her actions, with contradictory impulses (virtue vs mischief) playing out in scene. The final choice to walk away demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("repackaged and sold back") in reflection passages.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through mushroom brightening, message accumulation, and conceptual unthreading that leads to Resonant Reconfiguration—Lina walking into desert as "a door" with diamond as transformed pressure. Cost is legible in blood, abandoned farm, and foreclosed return. Orientation anchored early (farm, mushrooms, bolt).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushrooms constrain and enable choices throughout—their pulsing guides discovery, their light fractures reality, their dimming marks transformation. The farm's physical properties (dampness, walls rippling) directly shape Lina's actions. Setting evolves causally from bright to dimmed embers, charging the final desert image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: bolt discovery → messages → reality ripple → conceptual unthreading → diamond transformation. Each beat narrows options under the textural lens. Cost is visible in blood, the farm's destruction, and Lina's irreversible departure into desert.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of pressure-into-diamonds emerges through concrete particulars without moralizing. The final image of walking into darkness "as a door" offers resonant answer to whether pressure creates value or destruction. Subtext operates through the bolt's submarine history and mother's IOUs, reweighting "promises" and "debt" without stating conclusions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Lina's pyramid-scheme-survivor lens colors everything ("recognized a relic of broken faith"). Voice modulates effectively under pressure, tightening during the reality-shift sequence. Minor convergence in message dialogue lacks distinction but POV remains controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("the farm's air thickened, the mushrooms brightening until their light cast long, wavering shadows"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("shadowseam and shimmering") but serves accumulative design. Minor template cadence in "She [verb]" patterns mid-story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pyramid scheme survivor with quantum physics and submarine archaeology creates non-obvious angle. The conceptual unthreading of pressure from diamonds shows genuine ingenuity. Risk-taking in the reality-fracture sequence heightens stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
