I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's internal conflict between resignation and creative reimagining drives authentic choices, particularly his rejection of comfort for "conception." His final transformation from observer to active participant ("this time, he wouldn't be the last one standing") shows earned change through concrete action. Minor deduction for the child's appearance feeling slightly convenient, though the sticky hand detail adds embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the town's revival through memory-as-alchemy lands with felt cost ("half-mad" persistence). The bottle's transformation from vessel for wishes to vessel for people creates strong causality. Minor weakness: the exact mechanics of memory-to-reality remain somewhat abstract, though the sensory cascade (scent→sound→touch) provides sufficient grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Paper-Lantern Cove's transformation from phosphorescent ruins to living market creates vivid contrast, with specific sensory work (burnt sugar, cinnamon, charred meat). The bottle serves as micro-setting that constrains choice—warming, pulsing, then emptying as the conception completes. Spatial choreography slightly weakens when the crowded docks suddenly appear, though the transition through closed eyes partially justifies this.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal grief through active conception to communal responsibility ("A civilization didn't sustain itself on memory alone"). The alchemist's agency drives the transformation through sustained concentration despite doubt. Cost is visible in his physical degradation ("creak of his own bones") and isolation endured to achieve revival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the alchemy metaphor—transformation requires conception over comfort, working memory over nostalgia. The fisherman's wife subplot provides counter-example where wishing failed. Final image of the alchemist turning toward work rather than celebrating crystallizes the theme that creation demands continuous effort, not single miracles.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled metaphorical density ("lanterns bobbed like fireflies," "ghost's kitchen"). POV remains stable with the alchemist's perceptual signature intact. The child's single line of dialogue feels natural with appropriate informality. Minor weakness in occasional elevated diction ("crucible," "vessel") that slightly distances during emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure, particularly in the sensory cascade sequence. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some metaphorical density in middle sections ("crucible," "vessel," "blueprints") clusters without full payoff. Template phrase "It was/wasn't" appears three times, creating minor cadence repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The conception-over-comfort framework offers fresh angle on resurrection narrative, with alchemy-as-memory providing specific texture. The reversal where ghosts gain "weight" and "warmth" through sustained vision transforms the ghost town trope meaningfully. Risk-taking in the ambiguous reality status of the revival adds complexity without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
