I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory density, pattern accumulation, and a final resonant reconfiguration rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's face-blindness creates a compelling perceptual signature that shapes every interaction. His methodical approach and buried empathy drive credible choices, particularly in the lance sequence where he literally "pries apart layers." The final walk toward the coughing child shows earned change through witnessed truth rather than vengeance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - Elias becomes "a portraitist of the invisible, a lance for the silent" with visible cost in carrying what he cannot see. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and memories layer to reveal Liora's erasure. Orientation anchors clearly (quarry, mist, Elias descending) and the before/after shift from failed witness to active carrier of silenced truths registers powerfully.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The quarry-as-wound metaphor constrains every choice - its "jagged mouth," drowned ballroom history, and mist that "curled like a held breath" create atmospheric pressure that enables the lance's resonance. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's condition perfectly: texture over faces, weight of silence over sight. The environment actively participates in revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure - from ribbon fragment to echo manifestation to the branded memory in the lance. The dominant stake (witnessing vs erasure) tightens when Elias realizes "she hadn't fallen. She'd been *erased*." Cost registers in his "methodical heart a little less still" and the weight he now carries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the opposition of seen/unseen, voiced/silenced without explicit moralizing. The final image of Elias walking toward the coughing child resonates as non-literal answer to witnessing injustice - not through justice but through continued attention to the vulnerable. "The dead didn't want vengeance. They wanted *witness*" crystallizes this beautifully.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary elevation with controlled rhythm - "his boots leaving no prints," "the way the cold seeped into his skin like old guilt." POV modulates effectively during the vision sequence. The perceptual signature of experiencing through texture and resonance rather than sight remains distinctive throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose density serves atmosphere but occasionally tips toward overwriting - "the mist curled like a held breath" and similar figurative language appears frequently. Some filter constructions ("Elias had always known the truth") dull immediacy. However, syntactic variety and information density remain strong, with the lance sequence showing excellent propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The face-blind detective investigating through texture and resonance offers genuine freshness. The quarry as drowned ballroom and the lance as tool for "prying apart layers of a place" show specific invention. While cold case mysteries are familiar, the execution through sensory accumulation rather than deduction transforms the trope.</comment>
