I'll evaluate this story as a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through recursive imagery, pattern breaks (the chipped die's disruption), and cadence shifts that reweight Lena's relationship to perpetual motion.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's contradictory impulses—capturing without reclaiming, climbing without believing in endings—act simultaneously throughout. Her final choice to continue climbing "because she wanted to" shows earned transformation with visible cost (leaving the smooth die behind). The "grim optimist" characterization manifests through concrete actions rather than labels.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Lena's choice to return to the stairs transforms perpetual motion from prison to chosen state. The cost is legible in leaving behind the smooth die and the unopened door to revision. The accumulative lens holds consistently through recursive imagery and pattern breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The staircase functions as both setting and constraint, with the chipped die's interaction revealing its recursive nature. Spatial choreography remains coherent through the sideways leap. However, the gray haze and abstract spiral could use more sensory specificity to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation occurs through accumulation: the chipped die's stuttering roll reveals the loop's flaw, forcing Lena's choice between revision and acceptance. The cost manifests in her deliberate return to climbing after glimpsing escape. One meaningful deepening that reweights the entire premise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mathematical proof becoming lived experience: "Perpetual motion isn't movement. It's the illusion of choice within a closed system" transforms into actual choice. The final reframing—climbing because she wants to rather than to understand—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through mathematical framing ("proof in motion," "elegant but useless"). Some filter verb clusters ("She had been climbing," "She'd stepped") slightly dull immediacy. Voice maintains consistency through pressure, though occasional abstractions ("time here was a rumor") could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several paraphrase loops weaken density: "Some textures weren't meant to be captured. / Some opportunities were only opportunities because they slipped away" restates without advancing. Template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions appears multiple times. Strong opening and closing lines partially compensate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The recursive staircase as mathematical proof made physical offers a fresh angle on infinite loops. The specific detail of the chipped die creating the system's exploitable flaw shows originality. However, the "missed opportunity" framework is somewhat familiar in literary fiction.</comment>
