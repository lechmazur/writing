<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The carver's internal conflict between craft and grief manifests through embodied contradiction—his twitching fingers, the chisel slip that voices his suppressed scream. The spectral father's guidance creates genuine pressure that forces a shift from carving names to "hollowing out the space around them," earning the final choice to teach his daughter "how to listen for the hollows."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from greenhouse to migration to family dinner, with the hollow-carving revelation serving as the decisive reconfiguration. Closure lands with visible cost—the carver accepting grief as "a door—one they could open together, again and again." The father's spectral lesson about grief being "the space between" lines reshapes the carver's entire practice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively shapes choices—the cracked glass projects butterfly patterns "like constellations," the damp earth grounds the carver's work, and the migration timing creates urgency. The butterfly pressed into his palm becomes a traded object at dinner, though some atmospheric details (jasmine, bruised violet) remain ornamental rather than constraining.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from solitary carving to spectral visitation to migration arrival to family gathering. The chisel slip that cracks Liora's stone forces the carver to confront suppressed grief, while the father's intervention reframes his entire practice. The final teaching moment with his daughter shows agency through renunciation of isolation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The hollow metaphor evolves from question ("Could grief be carved?") through revelation ("the space between them") to practice ("carve the hollows until they become a shape we can all live in"). The ending's door metaphor reweights grief from wound to passage without stating a moral, earning resonance through the butterfly exchange and the daughter's trembling acceptance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through craft-specific noticing—"calloused from decades," "chisel paused above the half-finished name." The spectral dialogue maintains naturalistic indirection ("You're holding the chisel wrong") while the narrative voice modulates from meditative to urgent as the migration arrives, though some passages drift toward elevated register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several metaphor chains strain coherence—"veined with starlight," "the dead teaching the living what they'd failed to in life." Template structures appear ("The greenhouse shuddered. / Not from wind, but from...") and some passages loop conceptually, particularly around grief metaphors in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The spectral mentorship tradition transforms familiar ghost-story elements through craft specificity—the dead teaching proper chisel grip rather than delivering messages. The hollow-carving practice offers a fresh angle on memorial work, though the butterfly-as-souls motif and ribbon-roll tradition feel more conventional.</comment>
