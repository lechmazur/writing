<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied trauma responses ("left knee locked when the needles came") and contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final renunciation of solving the equation in favor of "counting silences" represents earned change through prior causality with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds toward the Resonant Reconfiguration where Liran accepts mercy as absence rather than formula. Cost is legible in the "ledger of absences" and physical transformation. Minor orientation wobble in the shrine sequence slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest functions as active constraint—roots pulling him toward the shrine, bark "like sap, like blood." The pewter strap's transformation from restraint to reminder charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects trauma-altered perception effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: physical recovery → forest pull → shrine vision → understanding mercy's absence → final acceptance. The cost manifests in "body whole, mind a ledger of absences," though the middle shrine sequence could tighten for clearer stakes progression.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mathematics of mercy as "spaces between numbers" elegantly reframes trauma and recovery without moralizing. The final image of counting silences between bird notes offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how mercy functions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through trauma-filtered sensation ("proprioception screaming," "bruise-colored glow"). Rhythmic control modulates with intensity, though some filter-verb clusters in the shrine sequence ("began to sing," "began to count") slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density and varied syntax, but "something like sap, something like blood" construction appears twice; mild template cadence in "The forest remembered too. / Its roots coiled..." sequence. Final third maintains clean propulsion with high specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The equation of mercy as absence rather than presence offers fresh angle on trauma recovery. The proprioceptive awakening and ultraviolet forest create specific, non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in the abstract shrine sequence heightens conceptual stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
