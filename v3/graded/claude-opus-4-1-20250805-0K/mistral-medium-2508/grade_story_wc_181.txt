<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Veyra's bewilderment manifests through concrete embodied reactions (trembling fingers, breath hitching) and contradictory impulses between inquiry and self-preservation. The final choice to continue the cycle shows earned renunciation with visible cost—she understands the danger but chooses knowledge anyway. Minor deduction for some filter verb clustering mid-story.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—Veyra becomes part of the cycle she discovered, with the cameo returning to its starting state. The orchard-as-library revelation reweights all prior imagery, and her choice to continue rather than document or destroy shows clear cost. Orientation anchors establish quickly (museum, asteroid, Dr. Veyra).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The astral orchard functions as both setting and constraint—its blossoms contain dangerous knowledge that shapes Veyra's choices. Vivid sensory work ("violet blossoms," "pollen tracing equations," "smelled like pistachio shells") filtered through Veyra's curator perspective. The bathroom's graffiti and acoustics create intimate contrast to the cosmic scale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating revelations: cameo's resonance → reflection's warning → orchard's true nature → understanding the cycle. Each blossom touch deepens stakes (museum burning, previous curator, asteroid's past). The final choice between documenting/destroying/continuing crystallizes with clear cost—Veyra sacrifices safety for knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete tension between preservation and consumption of dangerous knowledge. The cameo's inscription shift from "Simply" to "Complicated" elegantly captures the thematic arc without exposition. The final image of Veyra eating the pistachio with her own face etched inside resonates as self-consumption through inquiry—brilliant non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct curatorial voice with academic precision ("palimpsest," "nonlinear inheritance") that fragments under pressure. The reflection's dialogue creates effective uncanny doubling. Some register elevation in places ("astral orchard pulsed with violet blossoms") slightly exceeds Veyra's established lexicon but serves the fantastical elements.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The past is a palimpsest; scratch deep enough"). Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor repetitive structures in the blossom revelation sequence and some filter verb clustering ("Veyra exhaled," "Veyra smiled") reduce immediacy in spots.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of museum curation with cosmic horror and time paradox. The "nonlinear inheritance" concept transforms the artifact-handling trope through resonance rather than genetics or culture. The pistachio shell motif connecting to faces/identity is unexpected and earned. Risk-taking in the fragmented, accumulative structure pays off.</comment>
