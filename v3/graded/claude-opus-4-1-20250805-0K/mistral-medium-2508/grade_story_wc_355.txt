<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to catalog silence builds convincingly through concrete details like ink-stained fingers and the device that "hummed when it found the right frequency of quiet." The shift from passive collecting to active engagement ("for the first time, he wanted to try") earns its weight through the diary's revelation about "The silence of a choice not made." Minor deduction for the slightly abstract epiphany about empathy not being enough, though it's grounded in the guild's specific history.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through catalogued silences to the final reconfiguration where Elias opens his workshop. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost: abandoning his isolation to engage with others' brokenness. The diary functions as the causal engine, each entry building toward Elias's stance crystallization. Slight deduction for the cost being more implied than viscerally felt in the final beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The workshop's sensory palette (beeswax, old copper, grimy window) establishes immediate texture, and the device's copper plate constrains how Elias accesses the diary. The fireworks create temporal pressure and sonic contrast to his pursuit of silence. The guild's ruins function as both historical anchor and future possibility. Minor deduction: the morning workshop scene could use more specific sensory grounding beyond "careful hands."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from intellectual curiosity about the diary to confronting Elias's core belief that "empathy was a frequency you had to tune into." The fireworks create genuine time pressure, and the diary's final entry forces him to reckon with his avoidance of conflict. The cost manifests in his leaving the workshop and opening himself to others' damage. Deduction for the resolution feeling slightly predetermined rather than fought for in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the taxonomy of silences, each type revealing texture rather than absence. The final image of "careful hands" mending what's shattered resonates without stating its moral. The story earns its wisdom about empathy requiring action through Elias's specific journey with the diary. Strong subtext in the woman who "didn't speak. She didn't need to."]</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent interiority with phrases like "collected silences like others collected stamps" and perception filtered through sound/frequency. The prose rhythm accelerates during the fireworks sequence and slows for reflection appropriately. Minor repetition of "silence" risks becoming a tic but mostly serves the accumulative pattern. The shift to shorter sentences in the final scene effectively signals Elias's changed state.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective variation in sentence length and structure. Information density is high in passages like the diary's catalog of silences. Some figurative excess: "shadows stretched long and thin" and "aftershocks of celebration" feel slightly overwrought. The paraphrase loop between "Maybe empathy wasn't just about hearing the quiet" and "Maybe it was about knowing when to break it" dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of cataloging silence varieties offers a fresh angle on isolation versus connection. The device that finds "the right frequency of quiet" provides specific texture beyond generic empathy themes. The transformation from collector to repairer feels earned through accumulated particulars. Slight deduction for the workshop-as-healing-space resolution trending toward familiar territory.</comment>
