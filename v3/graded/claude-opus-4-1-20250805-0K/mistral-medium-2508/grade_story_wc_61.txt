<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Veyra's internal conflict between accepting cycles and breaking patterns drives genuine agency through the memory sacrifice, with embodied tension in "breath hitched" and bones that "vibrated." The cost of losing her first bloom memory for transit creates earned closure, though some interiority leans abstract ("otherworldly sentimentalist" remains a label).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-break closure: Veyra's choice to sacrifice memory and step into untested light creates Decisive Change with visible cost ("the gear demanded a piece of her memory"). The nebula's cyclic bloom/decay establishes the pattern she breaks, landing with "for the first time, the pattern broke."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nebula garden functions as both setting and constraint—its "slow gravity" and petal cycles pressure Veyra's choice. Sensory detail effectively filters through her perception ("petals of ionized gas drifting," "luminescent blooms that pulsed"), though some descriptions trend ornamental without constraining action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating pressure: from observing patterns to activating the gear to sacrificing memory, each step narrows options. The cost is unmistakable—"let the gear take the memory of her first bloom"—though middle development could tighten between observation and final choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between cyclic acceptance and costly transformation, with the gear's "approximation of infinity" embodying perpetual incompleteness. The final image of stepping into light "that did not ask to be consumed" resonantly answers whether breaking patterns justifies personal sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with lyric compression ("stretched like a sigh") and consistent POV filtering through Veyra's alien perception. Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from embodied experience ("otherworldly sentimentalist," "fractal paths"), but rhythm effectively modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though some ornamental phrases don't advance pressure ("petals of ionized gas drifting in the slow gravity of forgotten stars"). Minor template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions mid-story, but the closing sequence maintains strong propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of garden/technology/memory-as-currency creates non-obvious world logic. The sonar-ping light-finding and resonance-based illumination offer genuine innovation, though "otherworldly sentimentalist" feels like prompt-fulfillment rather than organic characterization.</comment>
