I'll evaluate this story through the lens of Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lian transforms her relationship with scars, storms, and change.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lian's internal conflict between fear and transformation plays out through embodied details (trembling fingers, breath hitching) and concrete choices (pressing quill to pulse, tracing on stone). The transformation from fearing to embracing change lands with earned cost through her scars' metamorphosis. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("stories taking shape in the air") that could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through rune-work, scar transformation, and storm imagery, culminating in Lian's reconfigured stance toward change ("Now she understood it was the only time anything could change"). Cost is visible in the shedding quill tip and transformed scars. Slight deduction for the grandmother's wisdom feeling somewhat convenient rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating platform constrains choices (she must work before storm returns) and the crow's feather becomes a new tool. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (ozone scent, frost lattice, steaming tea). The platform's descent and storm's approach create spatial pressure that shapes the ending's urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pressure builds through the storm's gathering threat and the rune's physical demands (frost where fingers were, quill shedding its tip). The transformation carries visible cost through the crystallized tip and singing scars. Stakes deepen as Lian moves from fearing to embracing the space between storms, though the resolution could face more resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of scars into stories and the discovery that blooming requires stress. The final run toward "the next held breath" offers a non-literal answer about embracing transitional spaces. The crow's gifts and grandmother's wisdom layer meaning without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical control with purposeful compression ("Her scars were proof") and selective perception focused on tactile and transformative details. Rhythm modulates effectively between longer contemplative sentences and short declaratives ("They *sang*"). Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("saturated hush") that slightly exceeds Lian's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of striking clarity ("letting the stone drink the rune") but suffers from some abstract phrasing ("stories taking shape in the air between her hands") and mild repetition of storm/breath imagery. Information density is generally strong with most lines advancing multiple purposes. Some filter constructions ("She understood then") could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of rune magic, scar transformation, and storm cycles creates a fresh angle on coming-of-age. The specific detail of the quill shedding its tip as "deliberate surrender" and scars becoming songs elevates familiar transformation themes. Risk-taking in the lyrical approach and crystallization metaphor heightens meaning.</comment>
