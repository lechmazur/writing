<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation to "unwrite the future by mapping silence" is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied actions (kneeling by water, tracing patterns, measured breathing). Internal complexity shows in "lantern of calm opened and burned without smoke" and the careful balance between action and restraint. However, the character remains somewhat archetypal without distinctive personal flaws or contradictions that would elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—the prophecy's code untying "like wet shoelaces" and the valley's transformation show visible cost and change. The piece teaches its pattern early ("smoothed hush," "terrestrially cosmic shimmer") and pays off through density shifts. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3. Deduction for slight abstraction in how exactly "mapping silence" mechanically works to dissolve the code.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting constrains and enables the central action brilliantly—the brook becomes the medium for unwriting, its "delicate arithmetic" and "grammar without grievance" essential to resolution. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("paper thunder," "moonmilk," "velvet riverbed"). The nocturnal haven functions as more than backdrop, actively participating in the transformation through water patterns and acoustic properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes clearly established—preventing "noon of iron" and mechanized future—with escalation through the code's resistance ("balked at vanishing, clinging to stone like frost"). The summoner's agency drives resolution through breath and attention work. Cost is visible in the careful restraint required and what must be given up ("did not claim victory"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the code finally releases, though additional pressure points would strengthen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between noise/silence, code/mercy, with the brook's "patient grammar" embodying the alternative to prophetic determinism. The ending's "terrestrially cosmic patience" teaching stones offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext operates effectively through the fox's trust and the child's untroubled sleep. Minor deduction for occasional drift toward abstraction ("listening keeps the world from hardening").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—"nocturnal haven," "smoothed hush," "terrestrially cosmic"—with consistent lyric-accumulative voice. Rhythm modulates effectively with scene pressure (shorter units during code resistance, longer flow after release). POV remains stable and controlled. The prose texture serves the meditative action without becoming precious, maintaining clarity even through compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The wing tilted, catching moonmilk, and the brook answered with delicate arithmetic"). No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Prose propulsion maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks. Minor figurative density in places ("embered with curiosity," "grammar without grievance") serves the accumulative mode without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ritual magic and linguistic deconstruction through water-as-eraser concept. The specific approach of "unwriting" rather than confronting prophecy offers non-obvious angle. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure pays off. However, the summoner archetype and prophecy-prevention frame remain somewhat familiar, preventing higher scoring despite strong execution.</comment>
