I'll evaluate this literary piece as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The surveyor's "Stoically sensitive" paradox drives genuine internal complexity through embodied details like "boots remembering former thresholds" and the physical act of placing witness-bearing notes. The character's motivation crystallizes through concrete actions rather than declaration, though some passages drift toward abstraction ("to love them until they answer").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece builds density through the surveyor's methodical documentation ritual, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where accepting "living gaps" becomes the work's purpose. The cost manifests as solitary witness-bearing without "rescue or recognition," though the emotional price could be more viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion functions as both setting and constraint, with water-damaged specifics ("water-bitten program," "carp listening like patient archivists") that shape the surveyor's movements and choices. The environment actively participates through "pilings release when tide subtracts its weight," making the setting inseparable from the protagonist's work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes center on the surveyor's need to document what's lost, with pressure building through accumulation of specific cataloging acts rather than external opposition. The dominant stake—preserving memory through physical notation—remains consistent, though the piece lacks a decisive tightening moment that would elevate tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of "Placing notes in foundation repairs," avoiding explicit moralizing while exploring memory, loss, and witness. The final image of the city breathing "through its missing teeth, aligned and merciful" offers resonant closure without stating meaning, though "Interlaced absence" occasionally surfaces too explicitly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinctive formal register appropriate to the surveyor's methodical nature, with controlled rhythm in lines like "I take from my satchel an antique traveling inkwell, stained with tides of ink older than my meticulous patience." Some passages strain toward purple prose ("memory were bioluminescent"), but overall the perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The submerged pavilion lies ahead, a lace of arches veiled by green water"), though several instances of abstract philosophizing dilute momentum ("to catalog the way emptiness braids itself through what remains"). The piece occasionally loops conceptually, restating the documentation theme without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a shore surveyor documenting drowned architecture through hidden notes offers genuine freshness, transforming the archeologist trope through specific ritual and purpose. The "Hushed Blaze" paradox and image of placing notes where "no one expects a voice to be waiting" demonstrate originality, though some metaphors feel familiar.</comment>
