<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The potter's motivation to understand place-memory through practiced non-insistence is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied choices (cleaning frames, singing, making cups). Her zen philosophy manifests through specific actions rather than labels, and the final choice to "be that someone" carries visible cost of solitary commitment. Minor deduction for some abstraction in middle passages about "phototropic to kindness" that briefly shifts from embodied to conceptual.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with density increase and pattern breaks that reweight the dominant stake of understanding why places resist change. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the potter's realization that "someone keeps choosing the same steady tenderness" with visible cost in her solitary departure. The fractured timeline device through the lantern glass creates coherent pressure without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned oasis setting directly constrains choices through its emptiness, heat, and fractured temporal state. The lantern glass functions as micro-setting that enables perception of multiple timelines, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("chimney smoke flattens," "air seemed ready to thrum"), with the environment evolving causally as the potter's kindness activates dormant possibilities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of understanding place-resistance escalates through accumulative pressure as each small act of kindness (water, cleaning, singing, clay cups) deepens the oasis's response. The potter's agency drives the escalation through deliberate non-forcing choices that cost her resources (last water, time, effort). The thrumming intensifies and braids with "footsteps of people unseen" as visible consequence of her actions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete interplay of kindness, memory, and resistance to change without explicit moralizing. The recurring image of braided timelines shifts meaning from observation to understanding to embodied practice. The final realization that places resist change through "steady tenderness, again and again" reweights all prior material without stating a moral, earned through specific scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through pottery metaphors ("clay remembers hands," "ribs felt like kiln walls") creating coherent voice texture. Purposeful compression and lyric elision are taught early and maintained throughout. The psychic distance modulates effectively from observation to intimate realization, with diction remaining within the potter's contemplative lexicon even under the pressure of fractured time perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, and the prose maintains momentum through varied rhythm and syntax. Some abstract passages about phototropic qualities and fractured timelines occasionally slow propulsion. Minor template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions appears 4-5 times but doesn't cluster enough to trigger major penalty. Strong opening and closing lines that anchor voice and recharge motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of pottery craft, beekeeping remnants, and fractured timeline perception creates a fresh angle on place-memory that feels inevitable in hindsight. The specific detail of "phototropic to kindness" transforms the familiar environmental concept into something character-specific and thematically essential. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and timeline braiding heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
