I'll evaluate this story through the lens of literary fiction standards, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category systematically.

**Drive Lens Identified: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered observations and parallels between greenhouse recovery and neutron star research, with density increase and pattern recognition driving toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization succeeds through concrete embodied details—kneeling to trace spirals in dust, studying particles through a hand lens—with her scientific mindset consistently filtering both stellar and terrestrial observations. The parallel processing of catastrophe through patient methodology creates genuine character specificity, though internal contradiction could deepen further.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through "a practice of noticing, a practice of keeping faith with change," with visible cost in the flood's destruction and the slow work of recovery. The accumulative lens holds consistently as patterns build from dust to data to community repair, though the final paragraph slightly over-articulates the thematic convergence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains and enables choices throughout—broken panes become frames for equations, dust patterns reveal flood vortices, algae-slicked tiles demand careful movement. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("faint brown whisper," "earthy arithmetic"), with the micro-setting of butterfly dust functioning as both literal debris and metaphorical lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation rather than reversal—from personal recovery to scientific recalibration to community rebuilding. The cost is legible in "fallen leaves and silt," "tomatoes gone to filaments," though agency could intensify through more active choice-making rather than primarily observational stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the correspondence between neutron star decay and greenhouse recovery—"gradual change folding time like paper, not a melodrama but an accumulation of creases." The final image of continuing work despite inevitable decay offers resonant non-literal answer to questions of persistence, though "kindled humility" edges toward explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent scientific precision filtered through poetic observation—"neutron star researcher whose models once threw flamboyant fireworks at data." The perceptual signature of preprocessing reality through pattern recognition remains distinct, though occasional elevated diction ("kindled humility gathered") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"She was a neutron star researcher whose models once threw flamboyant fireworks at data, until the river argued for simpler mathematics." Some repetitive structures appear ("She would," "They would"), and abstract phrases like "kindled humility" and "theater of prediction" create minor register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of astrophysics research methods with greenhouse recovery offers genuine originality—using pulsar analysis techniques to understand flood damage creates non-obvious convergence. The specific detail of butterfly wing dust as microscopic lens for understanding both destruction and persistence elevates beyond typical disaster recovery narratives.</comment>
