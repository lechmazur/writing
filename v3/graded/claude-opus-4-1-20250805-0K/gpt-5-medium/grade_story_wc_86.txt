<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's "uncommonly thoughtful" trait manifests through careful negotiation tactics and the drawer pull's grounding presence, with internal contradiction between diplomatic duty and emotional weight. The Voric/Estaran commanders show distinct characterization through gesture (Raglen's grunt-nods, Della's grip-tightening). Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("shoulders drop as if armor exhaled") rather than fully embodied moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Situational lens with prisoner exchange as coherent pressure forcing stance crystallization. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through successful exchange with visible cost (grain sacks revealing Voric hunger, healer's urgency for dying boy). The drawer pull transforms from personal talisman to shared symbol bridging both sides. Slight deduction for cost being more implied than viscerally felt in final beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The parapet setting actively constrains negotiation ("spine of stone between flags"), with mist creating atmospheric pressure and "slick teeth of stone" endangering movement. The drawer pull functions as micro-setting, constraining choices when shown to calm the frightened conscript. Weather and moon phases drive timing. Minor deduction for some static description that doesn't alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on preventing violence through successful exchange, with escalation when "tempers climbed the steps" over the naming dispute. The narrator's intervention with the drawer pull meaningfully tightens pressure and forces resolution. Cost is visible (grain given despite scarcity, boy's survival urgency). Deduction for relatively gentle escalation that could push harder given the life-death stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of "recycling mistakes into wisdom" emerges through the drawer pull's transformation from grandmother's desk to peace symbol, and the school-burning backstory that both sides must transcend. The "narrow weather" between apology and forgiveness creates thematic resonance. Final image of cooling metal suggests temporary peace requiring constant renewal. Some thematic statement ("harvest the past") edges toward explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical compression ("wind combed the mist like cold fingers") and controlled metaphor. POV maintains consistent focalization with selective perception of diplomatic nuance. Dialogue is minimal but effective (Della's urgency, narrator's "Listen"). Some register elevation ("furrowed hush," "spine of stone") occasionally strains against the practical negotiator role.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong opening establishes atmosphere and controlled metaphor throughout (parapet as "teeth," mist creating "furrowed hush"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deduction for occasional overwriting ("shoulders drop as if armor exhaled through skin") and some repetitive phrasing around the drawer pull's temperature shifts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on prisoner exchange through the neutral negotiator role and the drawer pull as inherited peace-making tool. The synchronization through moon phases and the specific Voric/Estaran conflict avoid generic war story tropes. The transformation of a domestic object (drawer pull) into diplomatic talisman shows originality. Slight deduction for familiar mediator-between-enemies framework.</comment>
