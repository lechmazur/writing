I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern rather than causal plot progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" drives consistent choices through lighting rituals and storm-speaking. The arrival and teaching of the kelp-haired child creates genuine stakes around succession and continuity. Internal contradiction emerges between the narrator's role as herald and their deeper function as teacher, though some passages lean toward abstract declaration rather than embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, the piece builds density through repeated lighthouse imagery and storm dialogue, culminating in "our headline will always be weathered joy." The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the child's arrival and the narrator's shift from solitary keeper to teacher, with cost visible in accepting this "stubborn crown." However, the orientation remains somewhat abstract - we never fully anchor in concrete physical space or clear temporal progression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse built from recycled bottles, the glass lantern wick that "drinks light like rain," and the beam traveling through total internal reflection create vivid, specific setting. The foundation showing "emerald glass that once was bottles and now is bones for the beacon" constrains the narrator's world. The storm as entity with "mouth open at the sky and teeth made of waves" elevates atmosphere beyond decoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake of preserving communication/guidance after print media's death coheres through lighthouse-keeping and storm-speaking. Pressure tightens when the child arrives "in a crate" with prophetic abilities, forcing the narrator from isolation into mentorship. However, the conflict lacks visceral urgency - we observe philosophical acceptance rather than dramatic tension, and the cost remains more conceptual than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between old media (print) and new forms of communication (light beams, storm-speak), exploring how truth and guidance persist through changing mediums. The child who "swallowed a page of the final morning edition" embodies this transition. The final image of keeping "its emerald vow to tomorrow" resonates without stating a moral, though some passages veer toward explicit thematic declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through inventive compounds ("storm-speak," "shadow elation") and poetic compression ("Ships listen, or what passes for ships now"). The perceptual signature of someone who reads weather as language and light as communication stays consistent. Dialogue absence works for the meditative tone, though occasional register drift into abstraction ("accidentally prophetic") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong moments like "Light tumbles down mirror angles, touches prisms, and roars out to sea like a bell made of dawn" show excellent rhythmic control. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "I was accidentally prophetic" appears multiple times without variation. Some passages stack abstract declarations ("Shadowed elation is the only weather that lasts past midnight") that could be grounded in concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse-keeper as news publisher, storms as living entities with memory, and light beams as the new medium for truth creates genuine originality. The child who ingests and speaks unprinted headlines is memorably specific. The piece commits fully to its premise of communication evolving past print into light and weather, avoiding generic post-apocalyptic tropes.</comment>
