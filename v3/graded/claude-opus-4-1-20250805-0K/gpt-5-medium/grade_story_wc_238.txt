I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to deliver an overdue apology is grounded in specific guilt about selling "a rumor once that broke her, a lie wrapped in truth." Internal contradiction manifests through the narrator's role as advice-giver who failed in personal connection. The final choice to expose the foreman shows agency with visible cost, though Mara's characterization remains somewhat thin as a ghost presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through perfume releases, stylus writing, and sensory layering that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator plays the "imperfect miracle" nocturne. Cost is visible in exposing the foreman ("names and numbers, money trails") to save the orchard. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 ("gossip-column exorcist"), though the ghost-communication mechanism strains credibility slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sheet music archive with its dust "singing" and the orchard pressing "like a held breath" create atmospheric pressure. Sensory details layer effectively (jasmine, old rain, peaches, iron filings). The perfume bottle and metronome serve as micro-settings that constrain the séance method, though some descriptions edge toward overwriting ("dust sang under my shoes as if the floor were a throat").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—delivering an overdue apology before the orchard's destruction—creates time pressure. Escalation occurs through the perfume releases and Mara's increasingly specific responses, culminating in her request for "what I owed the living." The narrator's decision to expose the foreman shows agency with consequence, though the middle section could tighten its pressure points.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of "imperfect miracles" emerges through action: the flawed séance, the partial orchard salvation, the clumsy nocturne that nonetheless connects. Subtext operates in Mara's minimal ghost-writing ("You left" as footprints "smudged by tide"). The final image of playing together despite imperfection resonates without stating a moral, though some metaphors feel forced ("Forgiveness is a coastal town").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains a literary register appropriate to the gossip-columnist narrator who "advises through metaphors." Perceptual signature shows in musical and journalistic framings. Dialogue (minimal but present) carries subtext in Mara's terse responses. Some sentences risk purple prose ("violet glass clouded by decades of patient sighs") but rhythm generally supports the ethereal tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("dust sang under my shoes") alongside occasional overwriting. Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some metaphors strain ("memory chooses a door"), and there's mild template cadence in the "I had" constructions. The final line lands effectively with "though it was an imperfect miracle, it was ours."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ghost-séance through perfume and metronome offers a fresh angle on supernatural communication. The gossip-columnist-as-exorcist concept is original. The story commits to its ethereal-grit tone throughout. The specific detail of reorganizing sheet music "by how the composers smiled" shows imaginative particularity, though the core reconciliation arc is familiar.</comment>
