I'll evaluate this story through the lens of **Accumulative/Textural** - the piece builds through pattern, repetition, and density toward a resonant reconfiguration where the narrator dissolves into absence, teaching the hummingbird a new song.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation crystallizes through concrete particulars - tracking prints, teaching the drone to taste ink, refusing the metronome's throne. The final choice to "disappear" by letting ink erase the narrator's outline earns its weight through prior setup of the mentor's death and the market of stolen time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator dissolves into absence, breaking the metronome's counting - a visible cost that reweights the opening's "silhouette that refuses to darken." The accumulative lens holds as ephemeral patterns build toward this dissolution, though the algorithm/hunger reveal strains clarity momentarily.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment functions as more than backdrop - its "auric ribs" and "alleys hollowed like flutes" create the physical grammar for reading disappearing ink. The hut "low and blue with salt" where "panics are minted" constrains the final confrontation, making environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from tracking prints to confronting the time-theft market to refusing godhood over panic. The cost manifests when the narrator sacrifices physical form - "taking my outline with it" - to break the system, though the algorithm revelation needed sharper grounding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of disappearing ink teaching permanence - "Read the river of it, and you will see which rocks are hearts." The final refusal to "become the trader who sets the tempo" reweights the opening question about who profits from slowed time without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through phrases like "pale as salt," "consciously wild stillness," and "serene anger." The perceptual signature - tracking ephemeral patterns, reading ink like maps - stays consistent even as emotional pressure mounts toward dissolution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("I am an albino tracker, a silhouette that refuses to darken") but occasionally strains with abstract constructions ("an algorithm in the metronome that wants every heart to lag"). Some passages risk opacity without quite breaking clarity at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of disappearing ink as both teaching tool and weapon, the hummingbird that "tastes ink," and time-as-currency creates genuine freshness. The final transformation - becoming absence to break the market - feels both surprising and inevitable from the established logic.</comment>
