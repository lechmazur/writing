I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal linkage, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration when the memory engine activates.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's grief-driven obsession to complete Mira's memory engine demonstrates clear, embodied motivation through concrete actions (measuring craters, soldering seams, dunking head in cistern). Internal contradiction manifests beautifully in "I am an uncertain alchemist" working with "kintsugi intentions," and the final choice to hang the charm back shows earned acceptance of loss with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure: the engine's activation doesn't resurrect Mira but gives "the pattern of her choosing," transforming grief into understanding with clear emotional cost ("It does not give me her"). The accumulative structure coheres through repeated imagery (bells, ribs, gold seams) that reweight at the ending, and orientation anchors (workshop, acid sea, alchemist) establish by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The acid sea actively constrains choices (dunking head in cistern "to spare my lungs"), while the workshop's "metal ribs" and "pontoons" create lived-in specificity that shapes action. The statue's pockmarks functioning as "a map of absence" that must be matched demonstrates setting-as-puzzle constraining the central task, though some descriptive passages lean ornamental ("groans like a waking leviathan").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating pressure: from measuring the statue to fitting the key charm as "the final pendulum," with the engine's activation as the peak that "drinks the room." The cost is legible when the engine reveals "the hour when she fell and did not land" without returning her, though the resolution arrives somewhat mechanically through completion rather than a harder choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The kintsugi metaphor ("gild it where it teaches me to look") transforms from mere repair to acceptance of loss, with the final image of the charm swinging "toward the statue, as if that moon had found a tide again" offering profound resonance. Theme emerges through concrete action rather than statement, particularly in "the pattern of her choosing, which is the nearest thing to truth I can breathe."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice emerges through unusual constructions ("the bolts she was counting counted her instead") and perceptual signature ("my mind quilts memories together"), though register occasionally drifts toward overwrought ("a tone of dire enchantment"). The controlled use of present tense and consistent POV modulation maintains immersion despite some purple passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density varies: strong passages like "Each plunge steals a little fear and returns a little clarity" contrast with overwritten sections ("The sea gnaws the pontoons, each kiss a hiss"). Some metaphor strain appears ("the engine yawns unless I narrate the logic it will inherit"), and occasional template constructions emerge, though the closing sequence maintains cleaner propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The memory engine concept offers genuine freshness—a device that reveals not the dead but "the pattern of her choosing"—transforming typical resurrection fantasy. The integration of kintsugi philosophy with grief work through concrete mechanical action, plus the specific detail of matching statue pockmarks to engine ribs, creates memorable originality despite some familiar workshop-fantasy elements.</comment>
