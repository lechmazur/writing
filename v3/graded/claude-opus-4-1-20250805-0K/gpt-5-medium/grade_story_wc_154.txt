I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through layered images, translation metaphors, and the coral fragment's evolving significance rather than strict causal progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" drives concrete micro-choices through translation acts, and the boy's "shrewdly innocent" nature manifests in his dual-boat drawing and cast messages. Internal conflict between professional distance and emotional involvement plays out through the coral handling and careful word choices, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("lotus-hearted ache").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the mother reaches for the uncle's sleeve after learning the boy will keep his fingers—a gestural reconciliation earned through the narrator's translation work. The accumulative lens holds as details (cast messages, coral grooves, boat drawings) layer toward this moment, though the cost remains more implied than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hospital setting constrains choices effectively—the atrium's glass walls, waiting room dynamics, and medical timing all shape the narrator's translation work. The coral fragment functions as micro-setting, its labyrinth grooves holding "routes of patrol boats" that mirror the navigation between hostile parties, directly constraining how the narrator mediates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether translation can bridge the family's conflict-zone divide before the boy wakes. Pressure tightens when the narrator must decode the cast's "smudged notes" and find language that both relatives can accept ("Also Us"), with escalation through the mother trying the Reka word for shelter.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the translation metaphor—"unknot weather in other people's chests"—and the boy's boat drawings labeled "Us" and "Also Us." The final image of leaving one's hand "ungloved so the coral's memory keeps speaking" resonates without stating a moral, reweighting earlier material about shared anxieties.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric texture with selective perception ("mist-clad atrium," "pelagic syllables") that reflects the translator's island-hopping background. The prose rhythm modulates effectively under pressure, though occasional elevated diction ("pacific conflict-zone translator") slightly strains the intimate register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("monitors speak pelagic syllables"). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("lotus-hearted ache," "weather sensed in common") edges toward overwriting without pattern-teaching, and occasional abstraction ("small fidelity") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of medical setting with conflict-zone translation offers fresh specificity, particularly the child's cast as diplomatic document. The boy's boat drawings and the coral-as-dictionary concept avoid generic peace-making tropes through concrete island details and the "Also Us" formulation.</comment>
