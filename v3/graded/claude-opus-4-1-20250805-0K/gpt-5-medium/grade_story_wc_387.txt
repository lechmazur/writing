<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The net-mender philosopher demonstrates clear motivation to honor hidden effort, and this drives concrete micro-choices throughout (demonstrating with tea ceremony, refusing fireworks). The internal consistency holds as the character teaches through patient demonstration rather than declaration, with visible cost in the councilor's transformation and community participation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the community's collective recognition and participation in honoring unseen labor, with visible cost as they physically clean the parapet. The accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns of hidden effort layer through net-mending, tea whisking, and civic maintenance, culminating in the child receiving the whisk. However, the transformation feels slightly orchestrated in its completeness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The wet parapet, fireflies, and tea bowl create a micro-setting that constrains and enables the demonstration—the specific conditions of "after rain" and "firefly season" charge the final teaching moment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("Water threads along the stone lip, murmuring"), with the environment actively shaping choices through moon paths and wet stones.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of appreciating hidden effort before it disappears is signaled early and tested through the demonstration's risk of failure ("frowned, but their schedules were full"). The councilor's skepticism provides resistance that transforms to participation, with visible cost as the community physically engages in maintenance work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the accumulation of specific hidden labors (net-mending, night sweeping, hinge oiling) without moralizing. The final image of the child cradling the whisk "like a crab rescued from a bucket" offers a resonant, non-literal answer about gratitude's rhythm that reweights all prior patterns of unseen effort.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout ("I sit with demure audacity," "moon paths across the district") with consistent lyric compression that serves the accumulative design. The voice maintains its philosophical-poetic register under pressure without head-hopping, and the patterned elision ("Tonight was for patterns; tomorrow, for hands") pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While prose achieves moments of beauty ("Fireflies lift and settle, a scintillatingly somber choir with lantern throats"), there's occasional overwriting and some template cadence in the middle section with repetitive "I [verb]" constructions. Information density is generally high but could be tighter in the exposition of past events (fisher's net story).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of manual labor philosophy with civic demonstration through tea ceremony is genuinely fresh and earned through specific detail. The risk of conducting a "demonstration" without fireworks that transforms into communal recognition shows bold structural choice that heightens meaning, with the whisk-as-storm metaphor providing unexpected depth.</comment>
