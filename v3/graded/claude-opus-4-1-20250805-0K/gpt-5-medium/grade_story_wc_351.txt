<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's helix-minded, spiral-focused engineering mindset genuinely shapes perception and action throughout, with contradictory impulses ("calm panic of recognition") acting in scene. The final choice to become "the patient recorder of abandoned dreams" is earned through prior causality, though the colleague character lacks sufficient pressure to fully test the protagonist's values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates as Accumulative/Textural, building density through layered memories and canyon resonances toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator accepts a new role. Cost is visible in the mirror breaking "a final time" and the narrator feeling "no panic, only a wider field of view," though the transformation could be more viscerally grounded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon functions as more than backdrop—its "ribbed shadows," mica walls, and limestone shelves actively enable the memory-excavation process. Setting constrains choice when the canyon "opened a seam where cold air threaded like memory," directly shaping the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through the three pulses of memory-excavation, each deepening the narrator's entanglement with abandoned dreams. The canyon's physical quake answering the final pulse provides escalation, though the lack of genuine opposition or risk limits the stakes' visceral impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the archaeology metaphor and the canyon as "phonograph" of dreams, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of "tending the seams where futures and fossils converse" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to questions of memory and transformation without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout ("helix-minded," "chaotically precise") with controlled lyric compression that serves the reverie tone. POV remains stable despite the experimental memory-merging sequences, and specialized engineering vocabulary ("notch filter," "seeded cloud") stays within the narrator's plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("moonlit canyon trembled like a lung relearning breath"). Minor template cadence appears in "I saw...I felt...I steadied" sequence but doesn't pervade or touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of using a broken periscope mirror as "needle" for playing canyon-stored memories offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of engineering precision with dream archaeology feels specific and non-obvious, though the abstract nature of the memory sequences limits full emotional grounding.</comment>
