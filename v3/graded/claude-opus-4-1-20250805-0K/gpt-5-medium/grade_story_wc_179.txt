<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rell's transformation from carrying "unfinished arguments" to releasing resentment is earned through visceral cellular memory of his mother's absence, with contradictory impulses (holding vs. releasing) acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to accept the broken music box shows credible endurance with visible cost ("smiles like a door learning it was always a window"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("shifting grace gusts like a wind with hands") that briefly dulls embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration achieved through Rell's acceptance of the broken pin as compass, reweighting his resentment into breath. The sanctuary's rule of "shifting grace" creates consistent world logic where reality bends to emotional need, culminating in visible cost as Rell "returns the unspent years to the floor." Slight deduction for mild orientation delay (sanctuary's nature clarified gradually) though this serves the dreamlike texture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary constrains every choice through its enforced silence, with the broken music box as micro-setting driving the central transformation. Vivid sensory work ("walls soften like breath," "floor ripples like sleeping water") filtered through the narrator's scheming-pacifist lens. The factory memory sequence uses space brilliantly ("belts carry not metal, but the breath his mother forgot to exhale"), directly charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation operates through textural deepening as Rell moves from surface resistance to cellular memory to final acceptance, with the sanctuary's "shifting grace" forcing stance crystallization. The cost is legible when "resentment loosens from his tongue like old thread" and he "returns the unspent years." One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length, though the transformation could use slightly more resistance to heighten the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the broken music box metaphor—incompleteness that still carries meaning—without stating morals. The final image of Rell carrying "the broken pin like a compass" offers a non-literal answer about navigating by absence rather than presence. Strong subtext in the narrator's "scheming" mercy and the sanctuary's paradox of soundless healing reweights the concept of wholeness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature with the narrator's paradoxical "scheming pacifist" voice creating controlled ambiguity ("I convince by arranging encounters that run deeper than hearing"). Purposeful compression and lyric elision work well, though occasional register elevation ("cellular memory, the old library beneath words") slightly exceeds the established voice. The taught pattern of silence-as-communication pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("spine learned to quarrel with waking"), but some overwriting in metaphor density ("shifting grace gusts like a wind with hands" followed immediately by more figurative language). Minor paraphrase loop with "shifting grace" explained twice in adjacent passages. Information density high in peak moments, particularly the factory sequence, though some abstract phrasing ("unopened letters" as metaphor) occasionally dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of a sanctuary that heals through enforced silence and "cellular memory" offers fresh inflection on trauma healing, avoiding therapy-speak for visceral, embodied transformation. The broken music box as central metaphor—something that cannot play but still shapes—is highly original. Risk-taking in the non-linear reality shifts and lyric compression heightens stakes (+0.3), with the scheming-pacifist paradox creating memorable perspective.</comment>
