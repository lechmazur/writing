<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's cautious hopefulness manifests through concrete actions—checking charts, tracing signals, choosing breakfast without the chair—with contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. skepticism) acting simultaneously. The final choice to interfere despite the trickster's temptations shows earned renunciation with visible cost (refusing tenure/headlines). Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("cautiously hopeful, but I shelve hope until evidence") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with subsonic frequencies as the persistent constraint shaping tactics throughout. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the narrator's active resistance creating breathing space for the community, with cost visible in refusing the trickster's offers. The orientation anchors (midnight shift, university radio, election season) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The radio station setting actively constrains choices through equipment limitations, budget restrictions, and the physical antenna array that must be climbed. Sensory details filter through the narrator's technical expertise ("boards crackled like dry ice," "carrier wave with a patient pulse"). The astronomical charts function as micro-setting that shapes the narrator's mapping solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through deepening pattern recognition: static interpretation → signal detection → tracing to source → active interference → trickster's counter-pressure → final resistance. The dominant stake (community autonomy vs. manipulation) tightens as the narrator discovers the signal's orchestration of campus divisions. Cost is legible in the refused rewards and the effort required to maintain counter-signals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete struggle between amplified discord and restored agency, with the final annotation "to outwit cosmic tricksters, teach people their breath" offering resonant wisdom earned through specific experience. The signal's manipulation of "predictable arguments" and the narrator's counter-strategy of inserting "pauses into rallies" embody the theme without stating it. The ending reweights earlier campus conflicts as orchestrated noise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through radio/astronomical expertise ("Static had tempers; silence had accents"). Voice maintains consistency through technical-poetic diction that intensifies under pressure without breaking. The experimental compression and metaphorical density ("gossiping like galaxies") serve the ethereal tone while remaining legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("I watched the mixer lights like stars, blinking out constellations of disagreement"). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("It showed me neighborhoods from above, gossiping like galaxies, empires traced in traffic") occasionally approaches overwriting but remains purposeful. Minor scaffold in repeated "I [verb]" constructions mid-story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The cosmic trickster as subsonic manipulator offers fresh synthesis of political and astronomical domains. The specific solution—using phase inversion to seed "contrary timbres" mapped to campus locations—feels inventive and earned. Risk-taking in the compressed, metaphorical style heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity at closure.</comment>
