<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The violinist's motivation to reawaken beauty through subversive music is clear and embodied through concrete actions like using the locust shell as a mute and playing "resonantly soft" to avoid detection. Internal conflict between longing and caution drives micro-choices throughout, particularly in the tension between wanting to play freely and needing to evade the statues' surveillance. The final transformation—statues beginning to sway by choice rather than command—is earned through the protagonist's persistent risk-taking with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase and pattern breaks building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the orchard "began to reawaken itself" and statues root "not in command but in choice." Cost is visible in the risk of being sealed by the statues ("If I failed, the statues would lock") and the protagonist's sustained tension throughout. The closure lands with both transformation and felt consequence as even the city's machines "hesitated as if embarrassed by their perfect timing."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard and living statues create immediate atmospheric pressure while constraining the protagonist's choices—forcing the "resonantly soft" playing style and the use of the locust shell as mute. Sensory details like "fog licks iron like a cautious animal" and "fruit brightened as if remembering their own colors" are selective and purposeful. The environment actively participates in the closure as branches arc "to shade the waiting faces" and cobblestones sigh, making setting indispensable to the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—awakening beauty without triggering the statues' enforcement—is established early and tightens when "a statue reached for my wrist." Escalation occurs through accumulative pressure as the orchard responds progressively (sap, scent, wingless flight) and the statues move from uncertainty to active approach. The final cost is legible as the protagonist risks everything ("If I failed, the statues would lock") to achieve transformation, though the resolution could carry more visceral weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete tension between mechanical control and organic beauty, never stated directly but embodied in images like the locust shell as "a tiny cathedral of absence." The final transformation offers a non-literal answer: beauty doesn't beg but "remembers, and then it stands, and then it teaches stone to dream in daylight." The story resists tidy resolution, leaving the statues and orchard in a state of awakening rather than complete freedom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The narrator's perceptual signature is distinct—noticing how "fog licks iron like a cautious animal" and describing music as "a breeze between gears." Voice modulates effectively under pressure, shifting from lyrical observation to urgent precision during the climactic statue encounter. The prose maintains consistent POV without head-hopping, and the metaphorical register fits a musician's sensibility throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "The city beyond the span gnashes in perfect meter, a mechanical world that has forgotten its own melody." Some metaphorical density borders on overwriting ("a map of wounds that become windows") but serves the lyrical mode. Minor issues include occasional abstract phrasing like "fuller attention" and some synonym accumulation around music/sound, though momentum remains strong through the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of music as subversive communication that bypasses surveillance through "heart rhythms" offers a fresh angle on resistance narratives. The specific synthesis of living statues as both garden protectors and suppressors of beauty feels original. The story commits fully to its premise without retreat, and the transformation of enforcement into choice ("their feet rooted not in command but in choice") provides an earned, non-obvious resolution.</comment>
