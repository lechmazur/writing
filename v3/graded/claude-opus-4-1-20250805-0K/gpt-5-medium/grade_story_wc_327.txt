<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to preserve a dying language through texture-to-sound translation is clear and deepens as the canyon demands payment (the travel-name). Internal conflict between fear of the curse and duty to the elders creates genuine tension. The final choice to stay as caretaker shows earned transformation with visible cost—the permanent loss of identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (birds scattering, canyon resisting) that reweight the dominant stake. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—the narrator accepts permanent residence to tend the echo-school, with the cost of their travel-name paid on-page. The because/therefore linkage from offering the name to receiving the language's full testimony is clean.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canyon functions as active setting that constrains choices—the echo-tunnel that "swallowed my name," walls that speak only certain textures, birds whose choreography enables translation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "rasp like bark scraped by winter," "thinner than silk." The environment directly shapes the final choice to remain as caretaker.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation coheres through accumulating texture-to-sound discoveries, with the canyon's resistance forcing adaptation (building listeners, using bird patterns). The curse's demand for the travel-name creates a clear trade-off with visible cost. Agency manifests through the narrator's choice to feed the tunnel breath and apologize, earning the canyon's cooperation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the preservation of language as living texture rather than static record—"a moving concord that rose at dawn and nested in the evening's cold seams." The ending reweights the opening's "flawed diamond rumored to be cursed" as necessary payment for cultural preservation. No explicit moralizing; the cost of memory-keeping resonates through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature: "copper-veined storyteller," "quietly articulate because the valley favors words that do not bruise the air." Lyric compression serves the accumulative design—"traders counting lies on knuckles, a child naming dust storms." Voice maintains consistency through stress, with syntax reflecting the narrator's careful, textural attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The gem had a feathered fracture, and through it the stone ribs of the canyon trembled with unread syllables." Some figurative density in places ("metronome of attention," "fugitive meanings") but serves the lyric mode. Clean propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of language preservation through synesthetic translation (texture to sound) and the concept of echo as reader of braille. The curse-as-payment mechanism and birds as choreographic translators avoid template solutions. The specific cost (travel-name for language access) feels earned and non-obvious.</comment>
