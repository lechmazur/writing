I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through pattern, resonance, and density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's discovery transforms from personal quest to collective navigation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation crystallizes through embodied details—barefoot steps, ear to deckplates, palms completing circuits. Her "awkwardly confident" trait manifests in approaching the stone circle "as if acting a role she knew by blood but not by rehearsal." The final choice to share coordinates publicly carries visible cost (risk of "waking whoever had silenced them"), though internal contradiction could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara transforms personal search into collective wayfinding, with cost visible in risking exposure. The accumulative structure coheres through the hum motif building from tremor to full activation. Orientation anchors clearly (abandoned spaceport, post-rebellion lull). Deduction for slightly abstract final line about "courage to ask a machine the right question."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The stone circle functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—Mara must risk physical contact to activate it. Sensory hierarchy works well: "each nick a nebula, each fissure a comet." The spaceport's industrial decay contrasts effectively with the ancient calibration altar, though some descriptions edge toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal search to collective risk when Mara decides to broadcast the coordinates. The "lull in rebellion" creates ambient pressure throughout. Cost becomes tangible when she chooses exposure over safety, though the middle section could tighten—the stone circle discovery feels slightly convenient rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the navigation metaphor: finding bearings in absence, translating "need into navigation." The opera glasses transforming space into time ("not magnification but chronology") elegantly develops the seeing/finding motif. Final image of "orientation rather than rage" reweights the rebellion context meaningfully, avoiding explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "the abandoned spaceport repair bay breathed like a sleeping leviathan." POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Some moments edge toward purple ("thunderous serenity pressing against the ribs"), but rhythm effectively modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in the activation sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong syntactic variety and purposeful rhythm, especially in the stone circle sequence. Information density generally high. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("mineral and memory," "braided with the hum") and the abstract final line. The "margin of daylight" metaphor works but appears three times without evolution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient stone circle as starship navigation calibrator offers fresh synthesis. The transformation of rebellion from "rage" to "orientation" provides non-obvious resolution. However, some elements feel familiar (missing parent, rebellion backdrop), and the convenient discovery of exactly what's needed reduces the originality score.</comment>
