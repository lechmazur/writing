<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to understand weatherwalkers drives concrete choices through taste-based navigation, with embodied sensory details ("metallic spring unfurled under my tongue"). The final acceptance to "carry your story" represents earned change through witnessed experience, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("terrestrially cosmic logic").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory impressions and forest democracy imagery build toward the protagonist accepting their role as story-carrier, with cost implied in "when the taste of alone returns." The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the shift from skepticism to witness-bearing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lavender bluff and aurora create atmospheric pressure while the tin compass ring's taste-based navigation constrains movement choices ("citrus when we strayed near impatience"). Setting actively shapes the journey through sensory cues that guide decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity about weatherwalkers to witnessing collective climate negotiation, with the protagonist's compass guiding them through taste changes that reflect emotional/spatial states. The cost of carrying another's story ("when the taste of alone returns") lands clearly though could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the forest democracy metaphor and weatherwalkers as custodians of "unfinished debates," with the final image of carrying story as antidote to isolation resonating without explicit moralizing. The concept of emergent navigation through collective cues enriches the central question of trust versus skepticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines technical terms ("emergent compass," "terrestrially cosmic") with synesthetic perception ("taste was rain cut with violets"). The consistent focus on taste as navigation method creates unique perceptual signature, though occasional abstractions ("tomorrow remembering yesterday") slightly dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves lyrical density with lines doing multiple jobs ("She climbed the path as if gravity were reciting her biography"). Some passages edge toward overwriting ("aurora combed the bluff in green teeth") and occasional abstract phrases reduce clarity ("history had turned into circuitry").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synesthetic navigation system and forest democracy concept create fresh synthesis, with weatherwalkers as debate-carriers offering non-obvious angle on climate fiction. Risk-taking through taste-based compass and lyrical density heightens stakes while maintaining coherence.</comment>
