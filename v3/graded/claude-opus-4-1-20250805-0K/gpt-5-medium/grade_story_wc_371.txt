<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation as a "creeping normality noticer" drives concrete actions from clearing ivy to sharing bread, with internal contradictions between documenting loss and arriving "late." The encounter with the baker's ghost/memory crystallizes the cost of normalized forgetting through embodied detail ("dust on her sleeves," "wind-chapped mouth"). Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract "absolution" framing that occasionally drifts toward theme-speak rather than staying fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught resonance building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where sharing bread and planting seeds accepts ongoing responsibility ("absolution were a line thrown from shore that I will have to keep holding"). The baker's appearance deepens rather than resolves the stake, revealing the bakery's slow death predated the tarp. Cost is legible in accepting perpetual witness-bearing without exoneration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tea house setting constrains choice through physical resistance ("thorn and nettle") and enables communion through its preserved space. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("breathe when the wind exhales," "smells faintly of sesame and ash"). The overgrown courtyard functions as both obstacle and sanctuary, though some description tends toward the picturesque without always advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from seeking personal absolution to accepting collective responsibility for forgetting. The baker's revelation that "the oven cracked a year before the tarp" reweights the narrator's guilt, forcing acknowledgment that the wound preceded visible signs. Cost manifests in the commitment to return "with a trowel and a handful of tea leaves," accepting ongoing work without resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts of guerrilla gardening and bread-sharing rather than abstract statement. The concept of "creeping normality" gains specificity through the baker's story of gradual erosion. The final image of birds finding "seeds crowding the seams" offers non-literal answer about careful company versus miracles, though occasional passages drift toward explicit thematic articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("I garden the edges like I am speaking softly to a skittish animal"). POV maintains consistent metaphorical register and perceptual signature focused on small surrenders and careful observation. Some passages edge toward elevated diction that strains against the intimate scale ("heuristically gentle hands"), creating minor register friction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with lines doing multiple jobs ("The tea house had cloaked itself in moss and etiquette"). Strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Deductions for occasional overwriting in figurative density ("testing the patience of my heuristically gentle hands") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("sacred in the ordinary").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of urban decay narrative with ritualistic tea ceremony creates specific emotional texture. The "creeping normality noticer" concept offers non-obvious angle on gentrification grief. While the bread-as-communion and gardening-as-resistance aren't entirely novel, their integration with the ghost/memory encounter and ongoing commitment creates earned resonance.</comment>
