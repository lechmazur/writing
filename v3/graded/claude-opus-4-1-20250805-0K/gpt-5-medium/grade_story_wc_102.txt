<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to heal hoarded love from a past life is clear and drives concrete actions through the camera obscura practice. Internal contradiction between holding/releasing manifests through embodied breath work rather than abstract meditation. The final choice to "decant" unused love shows earned transformation with visible cost ("storage closet unlatch behind my ribs"), though some interiority edges toward therapy-speak ("where unused love is stored").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through breath-based revelation leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist releases hoarded love. The closure lands with felt cost as the "storage closet unlatch[es] behind my ribs" and the protagonist actively decants rather than spills. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (twilight viaduct, camera obscura artist, post-memory state).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct with blooming vines creates atmospheric pressure while the camera obscura functions as micro-setting that constrains the protagonist's interaction with memory. Sensory details layer effectively ("diluted ink," "white blooms mapping the curve like shy comets"). The bridge's ability to "hum with former footsteps" and respond to breath changes makes environment actively shape the healing process.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of releasing hoarded love escalates through breath work that makes "the arches thicken" and "river grow ribs of light," culminating in the glass room becoming a door. The protagonist's agency drives the transformation through deliberate breathing practice with kwan yin's tear. Cost is visible when the "storage closet unlatch[es]" and the protagonist must "decant" rather than "spill or drown."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete practice of using breath and camera obscura to locate "where unused love is stored" without explicit moralizing. The final image of leaving breath rhythms as "trail markers the future may follow back" resonantly answers the central question. The mirror-maker who "forgot to love anyone but the light" creates earned wisdom about hoarding versus giving through specific dramatized discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and perceptual signature ("twilight poured like diluted ink," "lantern inside the heart of a cloud"). POV remains stable with purposeful compression that serves the accumulative mode. The prose modulates effectively between contemplative observation and active breath work, maintaining coherent focalization throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly lands ("vines had flowered in improbable constellations") though occasional overwriting appears ("pilgrim of sparks walking inside the lens"). Some therapy-speak intrudes ("where the remainder goes when a feeling is not spent") but doesn't touch closure. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, though a few paraphrase loops appear mid-story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The camera obscura as a tool for hunting stored love offers a fresh angle on memory healing, avoiding typical flashback structures. The synthesis of Eastern spirituality (kwan yin's tear) with Western optical technology creates non-obvious specificity. The breath-based transformation mechanism and the stranger who mirrors the practice add authentic complexity beyond template healing narratives.</comment>
