<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's contradictory impulses—duty to the orchard versus desire for freedom—act simultaneously throughout, with the final choice to continue the cycle earned through visible cost ("The orchard loosened its hold, just a little"). The boy and mother function effectively as catalysts, though their characterization remains functional rather than deeply particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the final image of hours coiling "graceless and beautiful" while "the cliffs hold their breath" crystallizes the narrator's earned stasis with visible cost. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early through impressions without touching and pays it off when guiding the travelers using this same method.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth functions as both setting and constraint, with mechanical birds marking time and territory while the orchard's shifting geometry creates genuine stakes. The environment directly constrains choice through the frost deadline and the orchard's reactive nature ("The orchard does that when it smells fear"), charging the final image of perpetual duty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as the frost deadline approaches and the orchard tightens its hold, with the boy's nut becoming the key that enables escape. The cost is legible when "The orchard loosened its hold, just a little, because I had obeyed its bargain," showing the price of both freedom granted and freedom denied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of graceless beauty in servitude emerges through concrete particulars—mechanical birds scraping wind, trees drinking salt spray, impressions without touching—culminating in the resonant final line. The boy's question about growing "a safer world" and being told "Only if you teach it the right shapes" adds thematic depth without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout with precise, lyric diction ("The cliffside labyrinth sloped and folded like a fist opening slowly") and controlled rhythm that modulates with pressure. The voice maintains consistency even under stress, with purposeful compression ("Go before the frost takes the paths and makes them lie") that serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"I moved my hands through the air, leaving impressions without touching, coaxing doorways from absence" advances action while reinforcing the central motif. Some minor repetition of "impressions without touching" but it functions as pattern-teaching rather than loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of leaving impressions without touching offers a fresh angle on the guide-through-danger trope, with the orchard's memory of a lost city adding originality. The specific synthesis of mechanical birds, cursed orchard, and blueprint-as-body creates a non-obvious world that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
