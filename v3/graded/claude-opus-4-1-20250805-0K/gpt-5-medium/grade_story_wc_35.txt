I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory patterns, metaphorical density, and a cadence shift that reweights the keeper's remorse through the ritual of cooking and consuming.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chef-narrator's motivation to transform stored remorse is embodied through taste metaphors ("mouth full of borrowed thunder," "gums with rust"). The keeper's internal conflict crystallizes through the memory of his brother's death, and his final stance shift from bleeding to bearing shows earned change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the keeper stands taller, memory "subsumed into a body that could bear it without bleeding." The accumulative lens holds through sensory layering and pattern breaks. Cost is visible but could be more visceral at the exact closure moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The coral pavilion constrains choices through its contagious touch, and puddle patterns guide navigation. Sensory hierarchy reflects the chef's professional priorities ("scalloped edges," "bitter tide line"). The fortress setting after rain creates the specific conditions enabling discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: discovery of pavilion, contagious touch forcing engagement, cooking as transformation. The keeper's memory revelation deepens stakes. Cost manifests in the narrator taking on remorse to transform it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of cooking memories to make them bearable. The final image of vanishing puddles leaving "salt rings and beetle tracks" resonantly answers how we process collective trauma without erasing it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through culinary metaphors ("taste memories," "mouth full of borrowed thunder"). Lyric compression serves the accumulative mode. Voice maintains consistency even under the pressure of absorbing the keeper's traumatic memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("coral should not live here, and yet here everything sturdy turns brittle when kept"). Some figurative density in peak beats but pattern-taught. Minor template cadence in "I tasted...I asked...I studied."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of a chef who cooks memories fresh and specific. The coral pavilion as frozen archive of remorse offers non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in the lyric mode and metaphorical density heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
