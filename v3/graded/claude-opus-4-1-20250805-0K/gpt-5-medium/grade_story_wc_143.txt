I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is clear and deeply personal—documenting the last glacier moth before extinction, driven by childhood memory and professional duty. Internal contradiction between scientific detachment and emotional investment creates authentic tension. The choice to photograph rather than intervene shows credible restraint with visible cost in "my throat clean and still."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the moth's final flight reweights the narrator's purpose from documentation to witness. The closure lands with felt cost: "the moth made a soft collision with my sleeve, dusted me with a century." Orientation anchors early (moonlit summit, crater inspector), and the chemical timing mechanism provides causal scaffolding for the lyric accumulation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crater setting actively shapes the story—its stillness enables the chemical reactions, the seam harbors the moth, and the radio array's intrusion heightens the contrast between old and new ways of keeping watch. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "a wing like a shard of milk-glass unfurled." The moonlit summit constrains timing and creates the specific conditions for the moth's awakening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on capturing proof of the moth's existence before it vanishes forever, with agency funding as secondary pressure. The chemical timer countdown creates escalating tension through color changes (blue→ochre→white). Cost is legible in the narrator's acceptance that documentation cannot save the moth: "keeping watch did not save the night, it simply kept the night from leaving alone."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between old ways (Nightwatch's sand and lantern) and new (satellites, radio dishes), questioning what we lose in technological progress. The moth becomes a living metaphor for vanishing knowledge without forcing the connection. The final insight that "the dawning hush belongs to no archive but breath" offers a resonant answer about the limits of preservation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression and scientific precision: "the crater was only a silver bowl holding a slow breath." POV remains controlled with appropriate uncertainty about the moth's behavior. Perceptual signature shows in unique observations like "satellites taught the sky to buzz like a hive." No dialogue needed; the internal voice carries the full weight effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "I was purposefully curious, the way you become when every answer feels like a door to another losing." Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, particularly in the countdown sequence. Minor repetition of "hush" is pattern-taught and pays off thematically. Each sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of extinction documentation with personal legacy creates an original angle on loss. The chemical timing mechanism is inventive and specific to this world. The glacier moth in a crater seam defies expectation. While the eco-elegy frame is familiar, the execution through the Nightwatch lineage and the specific detail of chemical messages elevates beyond template.</comment>
