Looking at this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, I'll evaluate it systematically across all categories.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern accumulation of dust-reading, ceiling secrets, and ghost whispers toward a resonant reconfiguration where debt is released.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's contradictory impulses between duty ("hired to fix vertical journeys") and curiosity ("hunt ceilings") act simultaneously in scene, culminating in the earned choice to release the ghosts' debt. The character's expertise in reading dust patterns and arguing with ghosts creates specific, embodied moments rather than labels.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the mainspring's unwinding releases trapped time/debt, with visible cost in "the ceiling answered with a softness of release." The accumulative lens holds throughout, building from dust patterns to ghost whispers to the final payment of borrowed days.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned ticket office constrains choices through its ceiling architecture and hidden spaces, directly enabling discovery. Sensory details like "coins, mouse nests, and roses too old to remember their color" filter through the protagonist's professional priorities, making the setting instrumental to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: whispers guide to hidden clock, mainspring reveals debt ledger, unwinding releases trapped time. The protagonist's agency drives each discovery with visible cost in "admitting the debt meant naming the thief."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of time-as-currency and debt-as-trapped-souls without explicit moralizing. The final image of the non-flaking smile offers a non-literal answer about release and accounting that reweights all prior ceiling/debt imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in lines like "gravity prints its diary everywhere" and controlled rhythm that tightens during discovery beats. The narrative voice maintains its technical-mystical register consistently, with purposeful compression serving the accumulative structure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong information density, though some repetitive stems appear ("I + verb" patterns in middle section). Lines often do multiple jobs, as in "The ghosts had waited for someone to balance the clock," which advances plot while maintaining voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of elevator repair expertise with ghost-arguing creates a non-obvious angle on supernatural detection. The specific mechanism of reading dust patterns to trace ghost movements, combined with the time-as-currency payroll system, feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
