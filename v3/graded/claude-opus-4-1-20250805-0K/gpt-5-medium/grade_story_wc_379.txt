<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's patient facilitation and "leading through following" philosophy creates consistent character-specific action throughout. The final choice to open the library and share Noemi's letters demonstrates earned agency with visible communal cost. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("sandstorm calm," "metronome of ache") that occasionally replaces embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the mailbox opening through collective storytelling as the decisive change, carrying clear emotional and communal cost. The closure lands with the mailbox becoming an "open library" and the community's new dawn practice. Orientation anchored effectively by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution mechanism of the hairpin matching exact rhythms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The courtyard setting with hibiscus shadows and bougainvillea actively shapes the gathering space and communal dynamic. The mailbox as micro-setting constrains action and becomes the focal point of transformation. Sensory details like "sandal scuffs and coffee breath" ground the dawn atmosphere. Some abstract descriptors ("sandstorm calm") occasionally replace concrete sensory work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on proving "listening heals" through the locked mailbox mystery, with escalation through accumulated stories that "click some unseen tumbler." The developer intrusion raises external pressure effectively. Cost manifests in the vendor's tears and the community's vulnerable sharing. The hairpin solution feels slightly convenient but the emotional cost remains legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between communal listening and commercial development, with the mailbox serving as a physical manifestation of collective healing. The final image of tapping stories into "our common lock" resonates without stating a moral. Noemi's letters containing "Anyone Who Needs" deepens the theme of community care through specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with phrases like "I inventory stories before objects" and consistent metaphorical register. Some register elevation feels slightly forced ("metronome of ache," "throat cleared for ongoing song"). The collective first-person maintains stable focalization throughout. Dialogue minimal but functional when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, though some metaphorical density approaches overwriting ("each rib a rumor, each breath witness"). Template cadence appears in places ("Marta spoke of...Jonah confessed..."). Information density high in most passages. The "accession number made of breaths" pushes into purple territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of a mailbox that opens through collective storytelling rather than a key offers genuine freshness. The integration of thrift-store curation with community healing creates an organic synthesis. The contrast with developers provides familiar but well-executed tension. Some metaphorical choices feel reaching rather than earned.</comment>
