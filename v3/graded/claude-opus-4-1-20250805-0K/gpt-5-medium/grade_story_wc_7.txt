Looking at this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive (evident from its lyric density, memory-taste conceit, and pattern-based progression), I'll evaluate each category:

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chef's ability to taste memories creates genuine internal contradiction between preserving and transforming the past, with embodied sensations ("tongue pricked as if tasting lightning") replacing emotional labels. The final choice to share the soup carries visible communal cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("learn to trust again") in non-peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the shared soup that "moved through them like a hand untangling hair," with clear communal cost in accepting memory's burden. The accumulative lens holds as density increases from individual tastes to collective healing. Orientation anchors (greenhouse, chef, alignment) establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse constrains choices throughout—its broken panes become the portal for calling neighbors, its ruined soil holds memory fragments that feed the tree. Sensory hierarchy reflects the chef's profession ("river stones warmed by sun"). The drowned district and rust create lived-in specificity that shapes available actions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation follows accumulative pattern: individual memory-tastes intensify through pruning scenes, building to the communal risk of sharing forbidden "memory foods." The council's ordinance against healing creates external pressure. Cost is visible in each pruned memory's specific loss ("unfinished homework," "birthday party").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the accumulation of memory-tastes and pruning choices, culminating in "the loudest thing is the moment you refuse to hate." The final image of collective rebuilding "with flavors, quietly and together" offers resonant answer without stating a moral. The knowledge fruit becomes vehicle for examining what forgetting costs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "groaned when the wind rehearsed its old song," "shadows curved like commas waiting for their sentence." Voice modulates effectively under pressure, compressing during pruning sequences. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance shifts that serve emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid compression ("heavier than guilt," "memory less ash"), but several template-cadence runs appear ("I tasted...I spit...I knew...I clipped"). Some paraphrase loops in the pruning sequence. Information density high in most beats, supporting the accumulative structure despite these artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The memory-tasting concept feels fresh and specific, avoiding generic rebellion narratives through concrete sensory work. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and synesthetic conceit heightens stakes. The synthesis of food, memory, and gentle resistance creates something inevitable in hindsight (+0.3 for risk within band).</comment>
