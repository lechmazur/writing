<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lark's motivation to capture "the sound of trust breaking" drives consistent, embodied choices through micro-manipulations and the thwarting of the cutpurse. Her steadfast patience and inherited maps create a coherent character logic. The final choice to pay for dignity shows value hierarchy with visible cost. Minor deduction for some interiority that edges toward abstraction ("human weather") without full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through false starts toward the brittle inhale of trust breaking. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lark captures the sound and understands "even justice sounded like something breaking," with visible cost in the paid coins and fractured bonds. Orientation anchors clearly (pirate market, beneath pier, Lark enters). The pattern of near-transactions accumulates pressure effectively toward the decisive recording.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rotting pier that "breathed and creaked like a sleeping hull" constrains action through the hush that forbids sound until sunrise. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through vendor positions, lime spillage, and character movements. The split lime's "wet gasp" charges the moment of trust breaking. Setting actively shapes tactics through the enforced silence and creates atmosphere of "comforting unease."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing trust breaking) drives escalation through accumulating false starts that tighten the web between Kettle and smuggler. The cutpurse's attempted theft creates meaningful complication that triggers the trust fracture. Cost is visible in the broken bond, paid coins, and Lark's understanding that "even justice sounded like something breaking." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete pursuit of recording trust's fracture, avoiding abstract statements. The final realization that "even justice sounded like something breaking" reweights the entire collection project. Subtext operates through the hush, gestural tensions, and the watch fob's ticking conscience. The piece resists tidy morals while maintaining thematic coherence about betrayal's inevitability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters the market through sound-collector's awareness ("nerves braided with lantern light," "human weather"). Voice maintains lyrical consistency without head-hopping, using selective attention to track the web of tensions. Rhythm accelerates during the cutpurse encounter through shorter constructions. Clean free indirect style throughout with character-specific metaphors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly serves atmosphere ("breathing pier," "nerves braided with lantern light") though occasionally dense. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some repetitive constructions ("She [verb]" patterns) in middle section. Prose maintains momentum through varied paragraph lengths and syntax that matches scene tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The concept of collecting "the sound of trust breaking" offers fresh angle on betrayal narratives. Specific world-building (moonshine runner's maps, pier market's hush rules) creates memorable texture. The orchestrated false starts as method for capturing human breakage shows ingenuity. Risk-taking in the lyrical accumulative structure heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
