<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The alchemist's motivation is embodied through physical patience and concrete actions that reveal internal purpose without exposition. The sister memory provides earned emotional grounding for his quest. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "demonstrating patience physically" which edges toward label rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where the final exhale releases both lake and aurora, paying off the established "held breath" pattern with visible transformation. The alchemist's methodical pattern-making accumulates toward this resonant reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the frozen suffering and the sister's absence that drives the quest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The subarctic crater setting constrains every choice through cold that fights against manipulation ("frozen thumb fought"). Objects like the illustration plate become tools that shape tactics. The withered orchard's "ribs" and the closed-eye bark scar charge the final image with embodied loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each arranged object adds to the pattern, culminating in the fissure discovery and the teaching of breath to travel. The dominant stake—finding a route for the living—faces concrete obstacles in frozen sap, silent grids, and disagreeing compasses. Cost manifests in physical suffering and the sister's irretrievable absence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of translating heartbeats into maps—finding life patterns beneath apparent death. The final image of teaching breath to travel offers a non-literal answer about connection and release. The sister memory adds emotional resonance without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines precise technical language ("flash-paper," "ampoule") with lyrical compression ("branches like ribs, sap frozen mid-throb"). Perceptual signature shows selective attention to patterns and pulses. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction that slightly exceeds the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"frost traced his eyelashes" shows time passage, cold, and stillness simultaneously. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. Deduction for two instances of slight redundancy ("demonstrating patience physically" repeated) and minor abstraction in "moving stillness."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy, cartography, and environmental listening creates a fresh angle on navigation stories. The specific detail of "safekept starlight" in an ampoule and flash-paper as "fast handwriting" shows imaginative particularity. The quiet ending through teaching breath to travel avoids expected confrontation.</comment>
