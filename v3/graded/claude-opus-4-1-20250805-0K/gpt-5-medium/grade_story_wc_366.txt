I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered images, recurring motifs, and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to protect "the tender hush that arrives after weather" is embodied through concrete actions—building stone messages, maintaining the letter chain, holding sea glass to candlelight. Internal contradiction emerges naturally when the narrator claims to prefer the bunk below while sleeping in the haunted lantern room, and the final choice to write "Thank you" and place five stones for love shows earned renunciation with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of safety as "candle smoke, salt, and softened paper in hands," reweighting the anonymous letter chain from mere communication to embodied community care. Cost is legible in lines like "the ache that shines enough to guide" and the stones placed "where waves could almost reach them." The accumulative lens holds consistently, though some middle passages drift toward exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting constrains choice through the broken lamp forcing candle use, the specific placement of letters "in the crook of the stairs," and stones readable only at certain tides. The sea glass discovery "in the dust by the pedestal" and its transformation when held to candlelight charges the final understanding of safety. Sensory detail like "Wings brushed the glass where fog swirled like breath" creates atmospheric pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: from maintaining the lighthouse to preserving the letter chain to understanding safety itself as "the ache that shines enough to guide." The lamp's death escalates pressure, forcing the narrator to confront ghosts and previous keeper's drowning. Cost appears in "the luminescent ache that guards a coastline better than iron," though agency remains primarily observational rather than decisional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the anonymous letter chain as a metaphor for community care without recognition—"We do this to bottle the feeling of safety and pass it hand to hand unseen." The sea glass transforms from found object to "our small green lighthouse inside," and the final line "If safety could be bottled, it would taste like candle smoke, salt, and softened paper in hands" offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior exchanges.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature emerges through poetic compression: "the room above me remembered every shipwreck," "warmly observant, like a tidepool holding sunlight." The voice maintains lyric consistency through metaphorical perception, though occasional lines like "Safety is not the absence of loss" drift toward abstraction. Rhythm modulates effectively between longer meditative passages and shorter declarative moments of action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong figurative language serves the accumulative mode: "the reticent lighthouse supply skipper brings flour, oil, and silence." Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some passages like the letter descriptions become slightly repetitive. The final image achieves exceptional synthesis, and prose rhythm varies naturally between contemplative and active beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain as community care system offers fresh perspective on lighthouse keeper isolation, transformed through specific details like "Three stones means danger, four means soup." The synthesis of safety as accumulated small gestures rather than grand protection feels earned. Some elements (haunted room, drowned keeper) lean toward familiar maritime gothic, but the execution through lyric accumulation distinguishes the piece.</comment>
