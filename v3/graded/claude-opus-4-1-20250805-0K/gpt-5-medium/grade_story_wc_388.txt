<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "excavate truth from comfortable lies" drives concrete actions throughout—reassembling shredded documents, testing the resonator, teaching calibration to replace superstition. Internal conflict between debunking and witnessing genuine function creates authentic tension. The final choice to leave the diamond despite being offered it demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost ("no richer, but steadier").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: discovery of shredded documents leads to reconstruction, which reveals the resonator's true function, enabling practical calibration that saves the orchard. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator transforms "curse for calibration," with visible cost in the company's "Liability exceeds projected goodwill." The pattern of investigation→revelation→implementation creates clear because/therefore linkage throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The radioactive orchard setting directly constrains choices—dust storms force shelter, the packing shed's "cone of calm" enables investigation, the diamond's position "under eaves" matters for the resonator's function. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "dust storm came like a herd of hammers," "smelled faintly of disinfectant and pear blossoms." The environment actively shapes tactics when marking "spots where the calm failed" for new nodes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from investigating a mystery to preserving human survival in a hostile environment. The dominant stake—truth versus comfortable lies—tightens when the narrator must choose between leaving people their superstition or teaching them maintenance. Cost is visible in "everybody pays with breath" and the caretakers who "bristled at a truth that offered no cosmic fairness."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of the "flawed diamond"—"imperfection were not the signature of every useful thing we build." The story resists simple moral binaries, showing how corporate liability calculations create human cost. The final image of keeping the apparatus "turning" offers a non-literal answer about maintaining truth as infrastructure rather than revelation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical precision befitting a conspiracy debunker: "constructive interference," "field resonator," "lattice intentionally cracked." Perceptual signature shows selective attention to mechanical detail over emotional response. Syntax modulates effectively under pressure, shortening during the dust storm sequence, expanding during analytical passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs: "I am a conspiracy debunker, sharply observant, paid in bottle caps and secrets" establishes character, setting, and economy efficiently. Some metaphorical density in places ("stubborn lanterns refusing to extinguish," "herd of hammers") but vehicles remain coherent. Minor template cadence in "I wanted... They wanted..." sequence deducts slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise of a scientific device mistaken for supernatural curse offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic survival. Specific synthesis of radioactive remediation technology with human tendency toward superstition feels organic. The transformation of "curse" to "calibration" through patient investigation rather than revelation provides non-obvious resolution.</comment>
