<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "distill chaos into narrative" drives consistent choices throughout, with contradictory impulses (jealousy of past selves vs. present acceptance) acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to "keep walking, chronologically confused but forward" represents earned endurance with visible cost—accepting temporal disorientation while continuing patrols after one's own funeral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks that reweight meaning—the grave discovery, dream chronicling, and final acceptance form a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator chooses forward motion despite chronological confusion. Cost is unmistakable: "the day I died" and continuing to patrol "after my own funeral" shows the price of this acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mountain ranger cabin and ridge setting constrains choices (the scroll in the map drawer, the grave on the ridge) and charges the final image through ravens that "rehearsed insults until they were poems." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "snow rasped the windows," "the logbook smelled like wet wool and ghosts."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulative deepening—from seeing the grave, to reading the scroll's "erratic, glittering dates," to the dream sequence where past/present/future selves converge, finally crystallizing in the choice to patrol despite being dead. The cost is legible: accepting one's death while continuing the work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between chronological order and narrative meaning—"narratives are the only heat that lasts." The final image of walking "chronologically confused but forward" offers a non-literal answer about accepting temporal disorder while maintaining purpose, without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "jaded wonder," unique phrasings like "snow hissed like applause withheld," and consistent dream-chronicler perspective. Voice modulates effectively from contemplative observation to surreal dream sequence while maintaining coherent texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density and varied rhythm, though some metaphorical density in places ("Feral nostalgia paced the room, baring its teeth"). Prose propels through concrete images and avoids loops, with effective sentence variety and purposeful compression that serves the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of a ranger chronicling dreams after discovering their own grave offers genuine freshness through specific execution. The transformation of death into continued service ("patrol the day after my own funeral") and the synthesis of temporal confusion with narrative purpose creates non-obvious resonance.</comment>
