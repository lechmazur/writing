<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation to preserve small moments before they're lost drives consistent choices throughout, with internal conflict between professional distance and emotional investment. The woman's desperation for repair versus acceptance creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the convenience of the man's arrival timing, though the emotional complexity of their reunion earns back points.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear accumulative/textural lens with density increasing toward the reunion that serves as Resonant Reconfiguration—the covenant regenerates through accumulated proximate causes rather than decree. Cost is visible in the careful distance they maintain ("without touching yet") and the weight of what was lost. The orientation anchors (jetty, twilight, archivist role) establish clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming jetty with sea thrift and glasswort creates specific texture, and the warm boards where "old afternoons might still be steeping" constrains their walk and charges memory. The walnut ink's slow steeping mirrors the regeneration process. Setting actively participates in closure through the "same rail, same rust" recognition that transforms the locket photo's meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from archival preservation to active reconstruction of lost connection, with the dominant stake (whether memory can regenerate covenant) tested through proximate causes. The man's hesitant arrival creates meaningful pressure that forces both characters to choose engagement over retreat. Cost appears in "the breath she lost" and their careful final distance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the accumulation of small moments having weight equal to large vows, with the walnut ink steeping serving as central metaphor for how experience browns and deepens over time. The final line "to preserve the weight of small moments until even absence agrees to be seen" offers resonant answer without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "haunted euphoria bright as salt behind my eyes" and the archivist's careful, archival way of seeing ("walnut arcs," "brown, slow as a moon drawing breath"). Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("white parenthesis") that slightly exceeds the POV's established range, though the lyric consistency mostly holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the tide hummed like a low string and swallows stitched dusk to the sea"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("gull let the wind hold it in a white parenthesis") borders on overwriting but serves the accumulative pattern. Prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful repetition of "proximate causes."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of an archivist who preserves emotional weight rather than just facts offers fresh angle on memory and reconciliation. The specific synthesis of archival practice with emotional reconstruction feels earned. Transformation of the covenant concept from legal/religious to accumulated small moments shows genuine insight, though the setup remains somewhat familiar.</comment>
