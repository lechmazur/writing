I'll evaluate this story through the lens of Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds meaning through layered imagery and pattern rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to transform from mourning jeweler to "tutor of endings" emerges clearly through embodied grief—metal that won't polish, the lily stencil's charged significance. Internal contradiction plays out between isolation and the need to help others, with the final choice to "wait" and "keep watch" earning its cost through accumulated particulars of shared grief work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the narrator's transformation from private grief to communal healing, with visible cost in the commitment to "be here as long as the curtains lift." The accumulative lens holds as density builds from personal loss through shared rituals to the final image of the singing lily. Orientation anchors clearly (observatory, after Devin's death), though some middle passages drift toward reflection without sufficient present-frame pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively shapes choices—the planetarium mechanism enables the projection work, the dome becomes canvas for transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "Light found dust like a river finds silt," "curtains of intention," the "cool as pocket water" ring. The micro-settings of beads, wire, and vellum constrain the ritual work effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming grief into teaching) establishes early and deepens through the shift from solitary arrival to communal practice. The accumulative escalation works through density increase—from one lily projection to multiple visitors' rituals, each adding weight. Cost registers in accepting the permanence of loss while helping others: "Good grief is a hinge too, and you never slam it because your fingers are in there."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "curtains of intention"—how meaning persists even when plans break. The lily's transformation from private symbol to shared healing tool avoids explicit moralizing. The mother-daughter scene crystallizes the theme without stating it: intention honors broken plans by admitting both light and "the room you have to move in."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled compression: "I had pawned my last commission and my patience." Perceptual signature strong in selective attention to materials and craft: "beads cut from coal of shipwrecks," "pins that held cradle ribbons." Slight register elevation in philosophical passages ("thread ourselves by what we mean") fits the reflective mode but occasionally distances from immediate scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The dome looked newly cut from night" combines setting, time, and emotional state. Some figurative density in emotional beats risks overwriting ("ardor subdued as a red star") but generally serves accumulative texture. Minor redundancy in explaining the intention/action metaphor weakens momentum mid-piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of mourning jewelry craft with astronomy teaching creates fresh ground—transforming private grief work into communal healing through projected constellations. The origami coordinates system and the lily-Lyra fusion feel specific and earned. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure and the quiet ending pays off through earned resonance.</comment>
