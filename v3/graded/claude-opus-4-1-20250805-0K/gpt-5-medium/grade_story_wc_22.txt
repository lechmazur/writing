<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation unfolds through embodied action—mixing fertilizers, reading bird calls, planting seeds—with his shift from driving soldiers to healing land earned through specific gestures. Internal complexity emerges in "He does not pray; he translates," though the piece leans heavily on external action over interiority. The final "narrow as mercy" crystallizes his patient endurance with visible cost in the transformed battlefield.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images of seed-planting, bird-reading, and dead-language speaking that culminate in "the battlefield unlaces under green." The Resonant Reconfiguration lands as Earned Stasis—the coachman's patient ritual transforms war ground into garden with the cost visible in his nightly labor and the reef's death that frames everything. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dead reef, blooming jetty, and battlefield-turned-garden constrain every choice—he must work with "salt-slick boards" and "shell holes filled with rain." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "seeds rustle like crows' feet on vellum," "coin-silver" sky. The environment actively shapes tactics as birds map "pressure lines across the inlet" that guide his planting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming battlefield from death—deepens through accumulation rather than reversal, fitting the textural lens. Pressure coheres as he moves from jetty to battlefield, each action (mixing fertilizer, reading birds, planting) tightening the treaty between "brine memory and seed breath." Cost is visible in the nightly ritual's patient labor against the reef's death.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete "submerged concord" between death and growth, never stated but embodied in every fertilizing gesture. The final image of crossing the "blooming jetty, narrow as mercy" offers a non-literal answer about patience versus conquest. Recurring motifs—dead languages, bird calls, seed pods—constrain choice and charge the closure without ornament.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: only this coachman would hear "where to spread them by understanding bird calls" or think "narrow vastness is a road." Voice modulates from practical ("cracks the pods with a coachman's care") to lyrical ("evening emptiness sharpens the harbor") without losing coherence. No dialogue to judge, but the internal consistency is exemplary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "He brews them from kelp ash, bone dust, and pulverized shells that once housed the music of coral streets" layers process, materials, and loss. Some elevated diction ("submerged concord," "unseam the wind") fits the mythic register. Minor repetition of "narrow vastness" serves as purposeful bookend.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of ecological restoration through ancient language and bird-reading feels non-obvious and earned through specifics. "Dead languages that unseam the wind" and birds as "scouts for wind and root" create fresh connections. The piece commits fully to its premise of healing through patient translation rather than force, though some elements feel literary-familiar.</comment>
