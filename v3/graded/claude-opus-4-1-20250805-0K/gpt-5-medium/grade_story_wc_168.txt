<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The firefighter's internal conflict between guilt and duty drives meaningful choices, particularly in how he "made room around the fact the way rock makes room for water." The mother's character emerges powerfully through minimal gestures—her "strict and tender" eyes and decision to repair rather than mourn. Both characters act from contradictory impulses (keeping/returning, bearing/unbearing) that culminate in earned transformation through the shared act of mending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through layered imagery (fire/ash/paper/stone) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where shared grief transforms into shared teaching. The cost is visible in "burned fingers" becoming tools for "enlighten[ing] without preaching," and the empty box becoming "lighter than guilt, heavier than air." The closure reweights the opening's "learned silence" into active translation of pain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge functions as emotional crucible—exposed, honest ("where the wind always arrives honest"), forcing both characters to meet without shelter. Sensory details like "porcelain making a brittle music inside his shirt" and "breath making small fogs" ground the ethereal tone. The setting constrains choices through its bareness, though it could more actively shape the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from private burden to shared reckoning as the firefighter's "bargained innocence" meets the mother's need to reclaim her children's memory. The tension peaks when she refuses to simply take the box, forcing collaborative repair that costs both characters their protective isolation. The final agreement to teach together demonstrates agency through renunciation of private grief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of translation—converting untellable loss into "a universal language" readable "by starlight." The paper children become a concrete vessel for exploring how tragedy transforms into wisdom without false redemption. The ending's image of "calibrating his steps to the heavens" resonates without moralizing, suggesting ongoing navigation rather than resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical control with distinctive constructions like "hard softness" and "the slow dance of celestial bodies." The prose rhythm modulates effectively between contemplative passages and the tense meeting. Dialogue is minimal but carries enormous subtext ("You kept them because you thought I could not bear them"), though the narrative occasionally strains toward elevated diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some figurative language feels forced ("brittle music," "small immaculate coffin"). The piece suffers from occasional register drift into overly literary constructions that don't quite match the firefighter's voice. Some paraphrase loops appear ("he could not bear"/"I could not bear"), but momentum generally sustains through varied syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of a firefighter returning saved objects transforms through specific execution—the collaborative repair becomes unexpected and moving. The concept of "bargained innocence" offers fresh perspective on survivor's guilt. While the setup of meeting to return objects is familiar, the execution through shared manual repair and future teaching elevates beyond template.</comment>
