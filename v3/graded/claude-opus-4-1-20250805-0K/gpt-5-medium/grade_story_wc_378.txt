<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The android's contradictory impulses between programmed care and emergent tenderness play out through concrete micro-choices, particularly in the handling of the tin's contents as "small devices for directing heat." The final renunciation of pure system balance for "workable storm" carries visible cost in accepting chaos.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the magnetic shift crisis leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the android learns to "carry both [code and dust] in a single body." Cost is legible in the acceptance of imperfect equilibrium over infinite balancing. The orientation anchors (greenhouse, android, desert rose farm) establish cleanly within the first lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glass dome constrains choices throughout—its "tilt in the water tanks" forces recalibration, while the tin's contents become tools that alter the environment's balance. The roses' transformation from "opaline and tenacious" to "crystal daggering" creates pressure that drives the miniaturized burn solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The magnetic shift creates escalating pressure through the pumps' polarity flip and roses' dangerous hardening, forcing the android's choice between system compliance and improvised intervention. The miniaturized burn represents agency through creative constraint, with cost visible in accepting a "workable storm" over certainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The child's tin transforms from mere safekeeping to active solution, reweighting the android's purpose from plant protection to holding "the capacity to frame [fear], to box it without denial." The final image of carrying "code and dust in a single body" offers a non-literal answer about containing chaos through care.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "radio of empty frequencies hissing where oceans used to pour" and "circuits crackle with a low snow of memory." The lyric compression serves the android's fragmented consciousness, with purposeful elision paid off through the resolution's integration of opposing states.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The roses are opaline and tenacious, strangely organic despite their mineral hearts" characterizes both plants and mirrors the android's nature. Some minor repetition in "recalibrate" appears three times, but each instance shows progression in the android's adaptation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The android caretaker with nostalgic programming tending crystalline desert roses under algorithmic seasons offers fresh synthesis. The controlled burn using childhood fears as "small devices for directing heat" transforms expected elements, with risk-taking in the lyric mode heightening emotional stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
