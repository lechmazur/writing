<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poet's motivation to understand their censorship scars drives consistent choices throughout, with "furiously tranquil" embodied in their measured response to revelation. The caretaker functions effectively as pressure/revealer. Minor deduction for the teacher revelation feeling slightly convenient, though the emotional cost of recognizing her sacrifice lands well.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where understanding the city's scars transforms the poet's relationship to their own censorship, with clear cost in accepting inherited trauma. The accumulative/textural lens holds as storm patterns mirror emotional revelation. Slight deduction for the teacher connection arriving late without sufficient groundwork.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory and storm function as active setting that constrains timing ("between thunder and thunder") and enables revelation through the dome's projections. Strong sensory work with lightning as "marginalia" and the city below as "healed page." The storm's electrical patterns literally map onto urban scars, making environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal summons to understanding systemic censorship to accepting inherited responsibility. The timer creates measured pressure between revelations. Minor deduction for the teacher revelation feeling slightly unearned, though the poet's final acceptance of their role carries genuine cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of scars as maps—trauma becoming navigation. The ending reweights censorship from silencing to creating underground networks of resistance. Particularly strong in how "furiously tranquil" becomes a learned stance for walking "brightness without being burned."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("rarefy fear into clarity") and consistent metaphorical register. Strong perceptual signature in how the poet notices everything through literary frames. Minor deduction for occasional overwriting ("arterial lines") that slightly obscures clarity in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with memorable phrases like "metronome for lightning" and "storm stepping back to the horizon." Deductions for density issues: overuse of figurative language in high-pressure beats (-0.5), occasional register drift into elevated diction beyond the POV's natural voice (-0.3), and some mixed metaphors that muddle clarity (-0.4).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of censorship narrative with storm-as-revelation device, particularly in using electrical patterns to map urban trauma. The "furiously tranquil" paradox as inherited resistance stance shows originality. Modest deduction for the teacher-student revelation following familiar mentorship patterns.</comment>
