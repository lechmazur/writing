<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's undercover mission creates clear internal tension between janitor duties and cryptid research, with embodied responses to the garden's strangeness ("Real notes rode in my bones"). The final transformation from observer to keeper represents earned change through accumulated pressure, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("frostbitten hope that never thaws") rather than embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through cryptid phenomena until the narrator accepts the keeper role—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("we let the garden metamorphose our bitterness"). The arrowhead's transformation from tooth to seed to sprouting root provides causal linkage, and the descent/return structure creates clear before/after, though some middle transitions feel compressed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The underground garden breathes with specific, constraining detail—"walls hung with bulbs that swung in a gravitationally playful rhythm," roots climbing "like fingers learning Braille." The drain as breathing portal and the vertebrae staircase create vivid spatial anchors that shape the narrator's choices, particularly the decision to plant the arrowhead "above the drain."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating strangeness: people returning "altered in posture," seedlings moving "like compass needles drunk on auroras," culminating in the descent where "a windless choir throbbed." The narrator's agency drives the climax through singing and accepting the keeper role, with clear cost in being "kept" and transformed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The central theme of transformation through acceptance emerges organically—"to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" becomes literal as the garden metamorphoses those who enter. The arrowhead's journey from comet-pruner to tooth to seed elegantly embodies cycles of change, and the final line about "frostbitten hope that never thaws" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends janitorial mundanity with cryptid researcher's analytical eye and poetic perception—"The herbalist's underground garden breathed like a sleeping whale." The consistent first-person maintains mystery while revealing gradual understanding, though occasional register drift ("gravitationally playful") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery ("black peppermint," "gravel weep backward into mountains"), but some overwriting appears in peak moments—"harmony untamed" and "frostbitten hope" feel forced poetic. Minor template cadence in middle sections ("It told me... It said...") and occasional abstract phrasing reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cryptid researcher as undercover janitor offers fresh angle on supernatural investigation, avoiding typical confrontation for gradual acceptance. The garden as living entity that edits people's spines and the arrowhead containing "handwriting" when sprouting show genuine imaginative reach beyond standard horror/fantasy templates.</comment>
