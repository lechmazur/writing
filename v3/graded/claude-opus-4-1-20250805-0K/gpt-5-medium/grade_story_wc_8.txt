<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's "emotionally rational" temperament creates genuine internal tension between documenting facts and acknowledging their human cost, particularly in the line "stubborn about facts yet aware of the ache that facts bruise." The final choice to publish both findings and method while delivering the ledger to families shows earned moral complexity with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator chooses truth over noble lies, with cost visible in acknowledging the stationmaster was "torn" and the families' "grief to finish its interrupted sentence." The accumulative/textural lens holds as details (ledger, photographs, compass) build toward reweighting the grandfather's "noble lies" philosophy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The railway station functions as more than backdrop—its "long throat of shadow" and ivy "whispering memory" constrain the search while the broken roof letting in seeds creates tactile pressure. The illuminated letter and charred documents provide specific texture that shapes discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from abstract historical correction to concrete human cost as the narrator uncovers "passengers" struck through and "missing factory lads who never enlisted." The dominant tension between noble lies and truth deepens when evidence reveals the stationmaster "burned and also saved," forcing the narrator to reckon with mercy's complexity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the rose's final petal enabling truth's surfacing—endings as permission rather than closure. The central question of whether "mercy needs disguises" or "mercy needs light" receives a nuanced answer through action: tell truth "without contempt" and let mercy be "consequence, not premise."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent academic precision with poetic undertones ("the station is a long throat of shadow"). Some elevated diction ("emotionally rational," "noble lies") occasionally feels more essayistic than embodied, though the perceptual signature of noticing illuminated letters and architectural decay remains distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "noble lies"/"mercy needs disguises" and the repetitive "I will publish" constructions in the final section. Strong moments like "the ivy shakes out a rain of seeds that tap my shoulders like shy reporters" demonstrate capability, but template cadence ("I write... I write...") dulls the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of historical investigation with moral philosophy through the specific lens of a family secret creates fresh territory. The stationmaster's margin notes revealing human ambivalence and the image of ivy seeds as "shy reporters" show original perception, though some thematic articulation tends toward the abstract.</comment>
