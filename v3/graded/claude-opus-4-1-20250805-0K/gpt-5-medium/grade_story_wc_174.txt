I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern and cadence shifts toward a resonant reconfiguration where the puppet troupe transforms their practice.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sorin's transformation from "urbane calligrapher" complicit in exploitation to ethical collaborator is earned through concrete struggle with the story stick and vellum. The woman's entry and taking control demonstrates clear agency shift with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "half-lit epiphanies" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the final "meteor hush" transforms from isolation to collective listening, with clear cost in surrendering artistic control. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through the stick's passage between hands. Orientation anchors cleanly establish the dome setting and post-argument context.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dome functions as pressure vessel, its "meteor hush" and acoustic properties constraining intimacy and amplifying conscience. The story stick and vellum operate as micro-settings that shape choices. Loses points for some abstract descriptors ("half-lit epiphanies rose like smoke") that don't fully ground in sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation reads through accumulative deepening as the stick passes from Sorin to the woman to the audience, each transfer raising ethical stakes. The dominant stake—whether truth survives their method—tightens when the woman enters and redirects their practice. Cost is visible in surrendering authorial control.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the story stick's transformation from "baton and conscience" to democratic tool. The ending's "meteor hush made of listening" offers resonant answer to the ethical question without moralizing. The puppets cutting their threads provides concrete image for the abstract concept of artistic exploitation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm ("meteor hush that turned footsteps into chalk marks"). Some register elevation in places ("urbane calligrapher" repeated, "prosthetic conscience") slightly strains POV lexicon. The woman's "clean and windworn" sentences effectively contrast Sorin's more ornate interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("strings crisscrossed the dome like constellations"). Deductions for repetitive "half-lit epiphanies" phrase, some abstract passages that could be more concrete, and occasional register drift ("prosthetic conscience"). The "meteor hush" motif works but appears four times, bordering on overuse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of puppet theater as metaphor for artistic exploitation, with specific inflection through the story stick's democratic function. The reversal where puppets write on vellum offers genuine surprise. Some safety in the resolution's completeness prevents higher scoring.</comment>
