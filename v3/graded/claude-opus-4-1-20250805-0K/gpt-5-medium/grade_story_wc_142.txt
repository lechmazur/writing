I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is primarily an **Accumulative/Textural** piece with elements of Situational. The story builds through layered descriptions of the carnival city, accumulating tension through the privatization threat, with closure achieved through a choreographed reconfiguration rather than strict causal progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Nessa's motivation as culture shock absorber navigating between guilds and planners is clear and embodied through concrete actions like encoding graffiti messages and negotiating with the liaison. The internal conflict between allegiances manifests in scene through her chip-pressing pact and the "ceasefire" with her brother, though some emotional transitions could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Nessa's choreographed solution that literally realigns the rafts, with visible cost in her temporary alliance with the consortium. The accumulative structure builds pressure effectively through privatization encroachment, though the orientation of the raft city's physical layout could be clearer earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The carnival raft city breathes as a living organism—"tents breathed like lungs, floats creaked"—with the foundation stone chip constraining choice at the climactic console moment. Setting actively shapes tactics through the graffiti color grammar and the physical realignment of rafts that "bent until the VIP zone met the fish market."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from fence appearance through graffiti resistance to the liaison confrontation, with Nessa's chip-pressing pact raising personal cost. The "bought us only a season" acknowledgment shows clear-eyed acceptance of limited victory, though the consortium's acceptance feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between preservation and change, with the final image of steering "toward a future that would not sell the past without buying our consent" offering resonant synthesis. The graffiti grammar and choreographed resistance embody rather than state the theme of cultural survival through adaptation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains consistent perceptual signature with phrases like "I think in loops and ledgers" and distinctive metaphors ("bright ribbon knotted over dark water"). The collective "we" sections maintain coherence, though dialogue with the liaison could carry more subtext beyond direct negotiation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and evocative imagery like "gulls argued with kites" and "drums would not learn our secrets." Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, though occasional filter constructions ("I knew it bought us") could be tightened.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of using graffiti art as encoded resistance instructions and physically realigning a raft city through an ancient console shows creative synthesis. The "culture shock absorber" role navigating gentrification offers a fresh angle on familiar displacement themes, executed with specific detail.</comment>
