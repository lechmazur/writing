I'll evaluate this story through the lens of Accumulative/Textural design, as it builds through pattern, repetition, and density toward a resonant reconfiguration where the narrator forgives the wheel and steps away from the ghost shift cycle.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to find "the weight of a swallowed truth" about his father's death drives consistent action through the tunnel exploration. Internal contradiction between skepticism ("belief never tightened a bolt") and the need to understand creates authentic tension. The final choice to forgive the wheel and walk away shows earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative structure coheres through the valve wheel as recurring anchor, building from radio confession through tunnel exploration to the final forgiveness. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when "I forgave the wheel, and I set it back to open" - a gesture that accepts the truth without requiring ghostly proof. Cost is felt in "Weight arrived in my arms" and the acceptance that "Normal means are heavy."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tunnel's cold dripping beads mirror the valve wheel's condensation, creating textural coherence. Setting constrains through darkness, echoes, and the physical pipe system that must be navigated. The valve wheel functions as micro-setting that enables the central choice - its threads counted "like rosary sorrow" charges the final image of stepping out "like a man leaving a shift."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from abstract skepticism to physical engagement when "My hands, disobedient, turned the wheel another quarter, and pressure climbed." The dominant stake - understanding the father's death without surrendering to superstition - tightens when the narrator must choose between belief and mechanical truth. Cost manifests in accepting that "Someone had closed a line to push output" without ghostly vindication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between mechanical truth and supernatural comfort, crystallizing in "both are habits; one thrives on fear, and the other counts the cost." The valve wheel accumulates meaning from religious relic to confession tool to forgiven object. The final distinction between the town's ghost shift and the narrator's metronome offers resonant complexity without stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains industrial precision ("threads," "pressure," "leverage") against lyrical intrusion ("rosary sorrow," "yellow coin"). Perceptual signature shows in how the narrator reads patterns in radio timestamps and interprets mechanical systems. The controlled rhythm accelerates during the wheel-turning sequence, with shorter clauses marking increased pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves density through lines doing multiple jobs: "I lifted the beaded valve wheel and felt the cold make my palms intelligent." Some repetitive structures appear ("I had come," "I swore," "I mapped") but serve accumulative design. Information flows cleanly despite compressed metaphorical language, though occasional abstractions like "weight of a swallowed truth" risk opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of industrial ghost story with mechanical skepticism offers fresh angle on grief and workplace tragedy. Specific detail like tracking "frantic calls to talk-radio psychics" by timestamp to map tunnel activity shows inventive approach. The refusal to provide supernatural confirmation while still honoring loss resists genre expectations effectively.</comment>
