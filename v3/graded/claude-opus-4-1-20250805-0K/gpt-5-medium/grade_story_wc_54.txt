<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "puzzle out new equations for hope" drives concrete actions throughout, with internal consistency between the engineering mindset and physical interventions. The janitor provides meaningful secondary pressure that shifts the protagonist's approach from solo technical fixes to community-oriented solutions. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract framing of hope as "system" without fuller embodiment in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration - the terminal transforms from abandoned to breathing with purpose, with visible cost in volunteer labor and "proportional headaches of functioning mercy." The piece teaches its pattern of redirected flows early and pays it off through accumulated changes. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The terminal functions as active setting that constrains choices - wrong flows force specific interventions, spatial layout guides the repair sequence. Sensory detail effectively filtered through engineer's POV ("arteries leading nowhere," "maze of intentions"). The sextant piece works as micro-setting that shapes ritual actions at junctions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of resurrecting functionality escalates from solo technical fixes to community shelter needs, with meaningful deepening when the janitor's practical requirements ("shelter the buses when the river floods") reorient the protagonist's abstract equations. Cost visible in physical labor and acceptance of "proportional headaches." One clear tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of redirected flows - both literal (water, air, power) and figurative (intentions, purposes). The final image of mutual breathing between narrator and terminal offers resonant answer without stated moral. "Hope is engineered, not declared, and tested by maintenance" crystallizes earned wisdom through concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct engineer's perceptual signature throughout ("flows were wrong," "equations in chalk," "balancing gradients against distances"). Voice modulates effectively from technical precision to lyrical wonder. Brief dialogue with janitor carries subtext and advances plot naturally, though limited dialogue prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The terminal listened by changing, which is one form of gratitude"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful rhythm shifts. Minor template patterns in middle technical sequence ("I rerouted... I flipped... I reversed...") but quickly broken. Final line achieves resonant closure through embodied action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on post-apocalyptic setting through engineer's systematic approach to hope. The carnival's departure as inciting condition adds unexpected texture. Specific synthesis of technical problem-solving with community needs feels earned. Some familiar beats in the helper-arrives sequence prevent higher scoring.</comment>
