I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through sensory layers and pattern accumulation rather than causal linkage, with density increasing toward a resonant reconfiguration at closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to restore the coastline through finding the goddess's echo is clear and embodied through concrete actions like gripping the rail spike "between thumb and forefinger." Internal consistency holds as the "cool-headed fisher" maintains patience while navigating the mystical garden. The final choice to "let the map spill back into the tide" shows earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator releases the coastline map back to the tide - "Give it back, she breathed, and I knew she meant not hoard but hold in a way that keeps opening." The accumulative lens holds throughout with pattern-building toward this moment. Cost is felt through the narrator having to surrender control of the coastline's restoration rather than possess it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden functions as both setting and constraint - "waves of sound rose into hedges and aisles" that the narrator must physically navigate. The rail spike as micro-setting "transliterates emotions" and becomes a tuning fork that shapes choices. The environment actively participates in closure when "the spike traced a coastline inside me, cove by cove."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from fishing for a voice to negotiating the coastline's restoration with the goddess. The dominant stake - saving the coast from "the type of silence that does not sleep but devours" - tightens when the goddess demands her name's return. Cost manifests when the narrator must release rather than possess the map, foreclosing the path of control.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between possession and release - "not hoard but hold in a way that keeps opening." The recurring motif of translation (spike transliterating emotions, stars speaking in wind) accumulates meaning. The final image of releasing the map resonates without stating a moral, embodying the theme through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout - "I stood at its jetty, a cool-headed fisher with brine on my sleeves and patience in my mouth." The lyric compression serves the accumulative mode with lines like "tracks are what music would be if it had to carry weight." Voice maintains consistency even under pressure in the final negotiation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs: "The sea there was not water but braided music, ripples of bass and hush." Some figurative density in peak beats ("waves rose into antlers and broke into petals") approaches overwriting but serves the lyric mode. Minor template cadence in "She asked... I said... I told her" sequence deducts slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of fishing imagery with sound/music creates fresh specificity - "to fish for a voice, to catch the echo." The concept of "sleepwalking constellations" that "step down when she dreams and rearrange the shore" transforms familiar mythic elements. The rail spike as tuning fork shows inventive use of the mundane object.</comment>
