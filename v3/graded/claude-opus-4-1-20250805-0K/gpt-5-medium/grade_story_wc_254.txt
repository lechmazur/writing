<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cloud-shadow poet's internal journey from cautious permission-seeker to boundary-crosser is earned through concrete sensory details and embodied responses ("tremor of certainty crosses our skin"). The collective POV effectively shows group psychology shifting from fear to courage, though individual characterization remains thin beyond the poet.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where boundaries dissolve "responsibly" as the group moves from atrium to lake. The cost is palpable in the guard's tears and badge surrender, and the final "fertile" certainty that "keeps humming" crystallizes the transformation with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium and humming quartz colonnade function as active participants, with columns tuning to pulse and harmonics braiding light. The frozen lake's progression from "white armor" to "cracks a delicate stanza" constrains and enables the final crossing, making environment inseparable from the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from gathering under "careful permission" through synchronized breathing to the decisive lake crossing, with the guard's transformation marking the key reversal. The pressure coheres through accumulating courage ("shy animal offered salt and dusk") with visible cost in abandoned badges and dissolved boundaries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of boundaries—physical, legal, emotional—emerges through concrete actions rather than declaration, culminating in "paraphrase it with breath, footfall, and compassion made audible." The poet's reinterpretation of law from "Keep afraid, lest meaning live" to touching thresholds gently offers resonant complexity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyric voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the piece's contemplative mode, with effective rhythm variation ("Voice by voice," "Behind us the humming"). Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("lantern-moth hush," "cobalt ribs lift") but the pattern is taught early and sustained through closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong momentum with purposeful compression, though occasional redundancy appears ("tremor of certainty" used twice, some paraphrase loops around fear/courage). Lines often do multiple jobs effectively, as in "glass fogs and clears, a diaphragm breathing the boundary porous and kind."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of architectural space as living organism with political allegory feels fresh, particularly the colonnade that hums "like throats remembering unspoken oaths." The transformation of ban-enforcement into organic dissolution through breath and harmony offers a non-obvious angle on resistance narratives.</comment>
