<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal struggle between floating and grounding is embodied through concrete physical sensations and the recurring tension between "gravity defier" identity and eventual surrender. The final choice to walk rather than fly represents earned renunciation with visible cost ("subtraction made room"). Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("periodically eternal") that lacks full embodiment in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis—the protagonist renounces flight ("no urgency to fly") with visible cost in the shift from defying to accepting gravity. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and repeated imagery build toward the final reconfiguration. Slight deduction for delayed orientation (who/where crystallizes slowly) though this serves the dreamlike progression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The viaduct setting constrains choice through its "slick" surfaces and puddle choreography that "prescribe a sequence." The rain and wet stone create atmospheric pressure that charges the final walking choice. Environment actively shapes tactics but could more concretely obstruct or enable specific moves beyond the floating sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from initial hovering "a finger's width" to following puddle pathways to the final lowering "a grain at a time." The dominant stake (conquering the labyrinth of self) tightens through the realization that conquest means grounding, not height. Cost is visible in the "subtraction" and abandonment of wings, though middle development could sharpen the pressure points.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete reversal that "the labyrinth of self sits flat on the ground, a floor disguised as air." The final image of beginning "where I had avoided ending" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral. The recurring drop/ripple motif and gravity/flight tension create layered meaning that reweights prior material at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "darkening brightness," "caustic starlight," synesthetic descriptions like "script of rainlight." Voice maintains lyric control under pressure with purposeful compression and rhythm that mirrors the floating/grounding arc. No head-hopping, consistent POV modesty with inference ("I could almost pronounce").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong moments of compression ("do not outrun what follows you") but several abstract passages dilute momentum ("periodically eternal, a loop that ends on the hour"). Some elevated diction strains against immediacy ("covenant with the ground," "vectors"). Information density is high in places but uneven, with philosophical abstractions occasionally replacing concrete advancement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The reversal that self-conquest means grounding rather than flight offers a non-obvious inflection on the gravity-defier premise. Procedural generation as metaphor for path-finding and the fractured timeline imagery create fresh angles. The specific synthesis of rain, tablet, and viaduct feels cohesive though some elements trend toward the abstract rather than lived detail.</comment>
