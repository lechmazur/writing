<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to honor her mentor through ritual care is beautifully embodied in concrete actions (cleaning skin, placing the chip, listening for patterns). The internal conflict between professional skepticism ("the guild still called it superstition") and personal faith creates genuine tension that drives the closure choice. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "unshaken and remade" which briefly lapses into label-speak at a peak moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with the aurora's variations, static patterns, and ritual gestures building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist captures her mentor's final essence. The cost is felt through "Let them meet themselves kindly, then let them go" - the mentor's voice teaching even in death, forcing the protagonist to accept loss while preserving wisdom. The "seed to be planted" creates visible future consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora function as active participants, with the aurora's "living veils" enabling the emerald chip's function and the grotto's "resonating drips" creating the sonic environment for pattern-finding. The body-as-setting works brilliantly: "the hollow at her temple," "slack at the corners," physical details that constrain the ritual's execution and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from physical preparation to chip placement to radio tuning to hearing the mentor's voice, each step deepening the stakes of capturing something before it's lost forever. The cost lands clearly in "the vision blinked away" and accepting "it would not resurrect her," forcing the protagonist to work within death's constraints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete practice of finding "patterns in static" - death as threshold rather than ending, memory as something actively cultivated rather than passively received. The final image of the chip as "seed to be planted" where "silence is tutored to bear fruit" offers a non-literal answer about how knowledge transmits across the boundary of death without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exceptional perceptual signature: "cloths folded like prayers, vials banked like small moons" shows the beautician-mortician's ritualistic attention to arrangement. Voice modulates perfectly under emotional pressure, maintaining poetic compression ("the world shiver near that threshold of stillness") while staying grounded in professional specificity. No head-hopping, controlled psychic distance throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "I cleaned the cold from her skin" simultaneously advances action, reveals temperature, and suggests care. Some figurative density in peak beats ("lattices that do not break all at once") occasionally approaches overwriting but remains pattern-coherent. Minor template cadence in "I [verb]" constructions mid-story prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of death-care profession with speculative technology (emerald chip that captures neural echoes) creates genuine freshness. The specific detail of "finding patterns in static" as inherited method transforms the familiar mentor-student dynamic. Risk-taking in the lyric-scientific hybrid voice heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
