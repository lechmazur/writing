I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and repetition toward a resonant reconfiguration where the historian commits to teaching walls to speak to each other in a dreamless world.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The historian's motivation to preserve stories before "silence forgets their grammar" drives consistent micro-choices through touching fragments, reading diaries, and ultimately teaching walls to speak. His porous nature ("letting other lives flow through") creates authentic character texture. The final commitment to "stitch a world from echoes" shows earned endurance with visible cost—volunteering to absorb stranded stories.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the historian commits to teaching walls to speak to each other, accepting the role of intermediary in a dreamless world. The cost is palpable—he "volunteers" to absorb stories "stranded without sleepers." The accumulative structure coheres through the brass disk discovery revealing the displaced axis "unseated dreams," making his final stance inevitable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library's physical details—"shelves made from ladder rungs and binding twine," "corrugated skin"—create lived-in specificity. The brass disk's "concentric circles offset from a center" constrains understanding and charges the final image. Setting actively shapes choice when he "rearranges the reclaimed silo library along the new pull."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from collecting stories to understanding the displaced axis unseated dreams, forcing the historian to volunteer as intermediary. The brass disk discovery deepens pressure by revealing "rooms woke in terror" without dreamers. Cost is legible when he accepts being "porous" to let stories flow through him.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image of walls as "abandoned dogs watch[ing] doorways, faithful to footsteps that would never arrive." The final line "stitch a world from echoes" offers a non-literal answer about creating meaning after loss. The displaced axis works as both physical reality and metaphor for lost human dreaming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows in phrases like "bronze quiet that even dust learns to honor" and "grain spine." The historian's voice modulates from quiet observation to intimate address ("steady now, steady"). No POV slippage; controlled psychic distance serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "walls began to listen the way abandoned dogs watch doorways." Some repetition of "displaced axis" and "bronze quiet" serves the accumulative pattern. Minor template moments ("He reads," "He writes," "He sits") don't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise of a world after "the last human dream is dreamt" offers fresh angle on post-apocalyptic territory. Specific synthesis appears in walls as repositories of stories and the historian as voluntary vessel. The displaced axis as both physical and metaphysical unseating shows conceptual originality.</comment>
