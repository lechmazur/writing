<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "recalibrate our days by puzzling out new equations for hope" drives consistent action through pattern-making and cross-dimensional collaboration. The internal experience of working with parallel selves is embodied through specific gestures and the gauge's needle movements, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("logical dreamer, lucidly watchful"). The final choice to teach the village these patterns shows earned agency with visible cost in the form of the upheaval called forth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens as patterns and decorations accumulate meaning until the final "serene upheaval we had called forth" lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The grotto setting and gauge mechanics remain consistent throughout, building pressure through iterative attempts. However, the precise nature of the "upheaval" and its cost could be more concrete—we see the village path "bright with scattered tin" but the actual price of this transformation remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tide-polished grotto functions as both setting and constraint, with water levels responding to pattern arrangements and affecting the protagonist's work. Sensory details like "stones shining like answers" and "obsidian" water effectively filter through the protagonist's perspective. The gauge and decorative materials (shells, ribbons, tin) physically enable choices and charge the final image of walking home with the gauge "poised like a held breath."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes center on revitalizing a storm-damaged village through hope calibration, with pressure building as multiple parallel selves collaborate on pattern solutions. The gauge needle's movements ("leaned left," "trembled right") provide concrete markers of progress. However, the conflict lacks a clear oppositional force or meaningful reversal—success arrives somewhat smoothly once the method is discovered, and the cost of the "serene upheaval" remains vague.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of hope as mathematical calibration rather than faith emerges through concrete pattern-making and the gauge's mechanical precision. The final insight that hope requires "buoyancy...but also ballast" resonates without moralizing. The parallel selves working toward shared solutions effectively embodies collective problem-solving, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement ("Not superstition, I would say, but calibration").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains a distinctive lyrical-scientific register with controlled rhythm throughout, particularly in lines like "gut-sealed pig bladders dyed with seaweed ink." The perceptual signature of someone who reads "possibility" through mechanical instruments while remaining attuned to natural rhythms is consistent. Some passages become overly abstract ("serene upheaval coursing beneath everywhere"), but the prose generally serves the accumulative structure well.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "The gauge listened to pressure within pressure, its face mottled with salt." However, several abstract phrases lack concrete grounding ("serene upheaval coursing beneath everywhere," "mindscape," "versions of me living a breath away"). The final third contains some repetitive phrasing around patterns and calibration that could be compressed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The concept of using a balloonist's altitude gauge to measure interdimensional pressure while creating ceremonial patterns is genuinely fresh. The synthesis of scientific measurement with ritual decoration to solve collective trauma avoids both pure rationalism and mysticism. The parallel selves collaboration adds an original dimension to the hope-restoration narrative, executed with commitment to the premise's implications.</comment>
