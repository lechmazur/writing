<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's infinite patience manifests through methodical rope-reading and seed-tending, with internal tension between urgency to preserve knowledge and the slow pace required. The final exchange with the fisherman crystallizes a mutual understanding earned through the night's vigil, though some interiority relies on abstract concepts ("patience is not passivity") rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens dominates as the piece layers rope-knowledge, weaving traditions, and seed-keeping methods toward a resonant reconfiguration where the harbor "keeps us" - a charged poise with felt communal cost. The fulgurite glass functions as a consistent constraint enabling the rope-reading, and the closure lands with the fisherman's return validating the narrator's vigil.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The golden dock, fulgurite glass, and rope coils constrain the narrator's actions throughout - the glass must be held to read knots, the dock's "ticking like a clock" drives urgency. Sensory hierarchy privileges tactile and auditory ("whisper of wool, hemp, and nylon") over visual in fog, and the harbor's final "keeping" transforms setting into active presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on preserving rope-encoded knowledge "before they unraveled in salt and forgetfulness," with pressure building through resistant knots and the fisherman's imminent return. The narrator's agency manifests in patient decoding and seed-blessing, though the conflict remains primarily internal without a decisive external test that would elevate the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the rope's "slow grammar" teaching patience, yield, and attention as forms of preservation - never stated but embodied in knot-lessons about drought, fish-handling, and storm mercy. The final image of the harbor "keeping us" resonantly answers the preservation question by showing knowledge as communal trust rather than individual collection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric density with selective perception ("planks shining faintly like old coins") and specialized vocabulary ("bollard," "clove hitch," "bowline") that establishes expertise. Psychic distance modulates effectively from close interiority during rope-reading to wider perspective at dawn, though occasional abstractions ("memory itself had a color") slightly weaken immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The glass is a conduit for listening, sand lightning remembers the path of charge"). However, abstract formulations appear in peak moments ("patience is not passivity," "attention is a sailor's prayer") and some paraphrase loops emerge ("I am infinitely patient" echoed later), preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rope-as-archive concept freshly synthesizes maritime and agricultural knowledge systems, with specific knot-types encoding particular lessons. The fulgurite glass as listening conduit and the secret weavers' non-verbal communication system create original world-logic, though some philosophical abstractions trend toward the generic.</comment>
