<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong dual characterization with Ilen's craftsman pragmatism ("not a mystic, just a worker of surfaces") contrasting effectively with Noor's emotional vulnerability. The synchronized breathing reveals contradictory impulses—desire to trap versus need to care—culminating in the earned realization that "the work was not to trap, but to teach holding." Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("fear of shatter") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught imagery (mirrors, frost, breathing) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the dream settles "as into a hammock" with visible cost in the "loosening like shoulders after hard labor." The closure transforms capture into care through accumulated sensory pressure. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of the "runaway dream" early on, though this pays off through concrete manifestation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ruined orchard with "frost like quiet ash" and fog that "climbed the trunks like memory of breath" creates atmospheric pressure that shapes choices—the mirrors must align with "winters of bark," the corridor must steady against fog. The setting actively participates in the resolution as "every mirror showed a city touching its orchard again." Environment constrains and enables throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from preventing the dream from tearing "the last cords anchoring the district" through the corridor's near-collapse ("edges begging to split") to the final acceptance of teaching rather than trapping. The cost manifests in Noor's physical struggle and the acceptance that "not all fences returned." One meaningful deepening through synchronized breathing that transforms the conflict's nature.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of boundaries—erasing versus maintaining—culminating in the insight that boundaries should soften "only where harshness had once pretended to be order." The broken sextant as "instruction, not shame, a guide to the missing angles" resonates without stating a moral. The final image of fog keeping "a seam bright as glass mountains at dawn" offers a non-literal answer to the boundary question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("frost lay like quiet ash," "lungs as windows"). The perceptual signature focuses on surfaces, angles, and craftsman details consistent with Ilen's profession. Minor dialogue effectively uses subtext ("Gentle, he murmured"). Some register elevation in places ("centuries of thick fog") but remains largely consistent with the established poetic mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly serves the accumulative pattern ("frost shimmered up the glass," "stars flickered in its ribs like trapped bees"). Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional abstraction ("cruel torn edges," "geometry where Noor first learned numbers") and some repetitive phrasing around breathing/exhaling that borders on template cadence in the middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of craft (mirror-making) with metaphysical capture creates an original approach to the dream-catching premise. The specific detail of using synchronized breathing to "teach the fog their pulse" and mirrors creating corridors where "sky and ground mirrored each other" transforms familiar elements. The concept of teaching holding rather than capturing offers genuine insight beyond template resolution.</comment>
