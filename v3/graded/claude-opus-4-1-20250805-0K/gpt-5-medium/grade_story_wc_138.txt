<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The immortal narrator's motivation to "discover what happens after goodbye" drives concrete choices through arranging Lio's arrival and manipulating the amulet fragment. Internal contradiction between boredom and purpose-seeking creates authentic tension, particularly in "purpose is the closest thing to mortality an immortal can borrow." Lio's withheld forgiveness applies credible interpersonal pressure that shapes the final negotiation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through prismatic imagery and magnetic field manipulation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where goodbye transforms from ending to "blueprint of the next room." The corridor sequence dramatizes this conceptual shift with visible cost—the narrator pays with memories, Lio with his refusal to forgive. Minor orientation wobble with "escondite" (undefined Spanish term) but recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite and magnetic storm create active constraints—the storm enables the dimensional manipulation while the prisms serve as both tools and witnesses. Sensory detail like "trapezoid of obsidian mirrors that hummed against my palms" and "air smelled like pages" grounds the fantastical. The environment directly shapes the ritual's execution and charges the final image of space returning to work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity about goodbye to a dimensional "spatial mutiny" requiring payment in memories and forgiveness. The corridor's revelation that "departure becomes infrastructure" meaningfully reweights the dominant stake. Cost is visible when both characters pay with what they've hoarded—memories for the immortal, withheld forgiveness for Lio.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that goodbye creates ongoing infrastructure rather than absence—"a bridge that the heart keeps mending to keep crossing." The spatial mutiny as "union strike, demanding wages of witness" provides fresh metaphorical depth. The final image of purpose as borrowed mortality resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct voice combines scientific precision ("coils sang in coils") with poetic compression ("storms make doors honest"). Perceptual signature shows through unique observations like "angles whisper to me when they plan rebellion." Dialogue between narrator and Lio carries subtext effectively, particularly Lio's laugh "in the same key as the hushed thunder."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong syntactic variety and information density, with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some metaphorical density in early sections ("secret folded into light," "echoes and refuses endings") but serves the accumulative design. Minor template echo with repeated "I [verb]" constructions in paragraphs 7-8. Clean propulsion through the corridor sequence to closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of dimensional awareness with emotional aftermath of goodbye creates non-obvious thematic territory. The concept of spatial geometry responding to emotional states through "union strike" is inventive. Risk-taking in the dense metaphorical opening pays off when the abstract becomes concrete through the corridor discovery.</comment>
