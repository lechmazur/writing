<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to cultivate foresight through action drives consistent micro-choices (chalking arrows, placing tape streamers, adjusting landing corridors) with embodied expertise under pressure. The mentor's patch functions as both borrowed authority and personal vow, grounding character depth. Minor deduction for the child's appearance feeling slightly convenient, though their interaction reveals the narrator's teaching impulse effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal closure where the narrator's survey work directly enables the helicopter's safe landing, with visible cost in the crashed relief craft and failing hospital generator. The accumulative lens holds as wind pattern documentation builds toward the decisive corridor adjustment. The "singular convergence" concept pays off through the dust devil's precise timing at the helipad, though the child's arrival could be better motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The container maze functions as active setting that shapes investigation paths and creates the wind tunnels central to the conflict. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities ("ribbon tape flashes from magnetized stakes, drawing pale currents"). The port environment constrains choices through its architecture, with the boulevard-to-helipad alignment revealing the lethal convergence point.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds from silence to survey to urgent helicopter redirection, with the hospital generator failure raising immediate stakes. The dust devil's "teeth and timing" creates specific cost through the crashed relief craft. Agency manifests through the narrator's practiced methodology transforming observation into life-saving intervention, though the tension could tighten further between discovery and resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the practice of "foresight in action, not in hindsight's sterile glow," with the narrator embodying this principle through methodical observation that prevents future disaster. The patch's journey from mentor to antenna creates resonant imagery about inherited wisdom and practical memorial. The final inventory of "what held and what almost failed" reinforces the theme without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines technical precision with poetic observation ("The towering labyrinth of shipping containers glitter like dark cliffs"). Perceptual signature shows professional filtering where wind patterns become "pale currents like a slow animal breathing." The controlled, contemplative rhythm suits the investigator's methodical nature, maintaining consistency through urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("I am an accident investigator, rapidly adapting to the blankness that follows other people's alarms"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("Silence gives you unshared custody of attention") that could be more embodied, though prose remains propulsive overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The accident investigator entering post-disaster silence offers a fresh angle on the detective archetype, with wind pattern analysis as unusual investigative focus. "Singular convergence" as multiple factors meeting at one critical moment provides conceptual originality. The transformation of urban architecture into wind-training apparatus shows creative environmental thinking, though the core rescue plot remains somewhat familiar.</comment>
