<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "transpose life into a new key" drives consistent choices from accepting the microdot specs to transforming them into public revelation. Internal contradiction emerges beautifully in "I had not changed the town with insight, only with arrangement," revealing self-awareness about their manipulative yet benevolent role. The final fortune "see what you have done" carries visible cost as the narrator confronts their own orchestration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with fortune-writing patterns building to the lighthouse projection that makes "You already know" bloom across kitchen walls—a Resonant Reconfiguration where open secrets become visible truth. The cost manifests as "their shoulders said thank you for arranging the tide," showing the town's ambivalent gratitude for forced transparency. Causality holds through fortune→microdot→lighthouse→revelation chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The harbor setting with its "neon fizzed out like a tired constellation" and the lighthouse that "grumbles in its sleep" create atmospheric pressure for secret-keeping. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from restaurant to causeway to lighthouse. The lighthouse lens becomes the constraining tool that enables the final projection, though some middle passages drift toward abstract description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal fortune-writing mishaps ("you will be seen" causing smuggler exposure) to town-wide revelation through the lighthouse projection. The protagonist's agency drives the transformation of spy specs into fortune projections, with clear cost in "everyone finally looked." Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as fortunes compound into collective acknowledgment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between hiding and revealing, crystallizing in "open secrets are waiting rooms where fear goes quiet." The final projection "You already know" offers a non-literal answer to the story's central question about truth and community knowledge. The recurring fortune motif constrains choices and charges the closure when fortunes become literal light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "I walked the causeway while the tide thought things over." POV maintains consistent metaphorical perception throughout ("envelope sweating against my ribs"). The keeper's dialogue carries natural indirection ("You are making a habit of orchestrating the weather"), though some passages edge toward overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density varies—strong in "Light scattered over the town in thin squares, and on each kitchen wall the same sentence unfurled" but occasionally loops with near-paraphrase ("open secrets keep the weather calm" echoes similar sentiment multiple times). Some metaphor density in peak beats ("neon fizzed out like a tired constellation") without clear payoff. Opening and closing lines effectively bookend the piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fortune-cookie writing with espionage creates an original premise where prophecy becomes community manipulation. The transformation of spy equipment into truth-projection device shows genuine ingenuity. The specific detail of fortunes "blowing back like gulls in a crosswind" grounds the fantastical elements in lived experience.</comment>
