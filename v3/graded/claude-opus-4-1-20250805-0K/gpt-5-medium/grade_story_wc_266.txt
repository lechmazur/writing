<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interior journey with contradictory impulses acting in scene (fear vs. need for courage). The protagonist's final reaching for courage that "fits where the star was pressed" earns the transformation through prior causality with visible cost. Minor deduction for the guides' characterization remaining somewhat archetypal despite their gentle persistence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as protagonist accepts courage "light as breath and heavy as love" with the skiff nesting in their chest—a decisive internal shift with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through ridge traversal and courage materializing. Orientation anchors established early ("After the leash breaks, the tide slackens").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway functions as micro-setting constraining choice ("every grain of sand clicks like a clock"). Sensory detail filters through POV ("fog gathers like quiet linen"). The ridge's transformation from distant seam to traversable spine that "hums with stories I did not live" effectively charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding unused courage) escalates from ache to active quest through ridge traversal. The protagonist's agency drives the journey—choosing bends "that resemble my old fear" and walking them anyway. Cost is legible as "children I did not lead, doors I never opened because I was leashed."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of the broken leash and unused courage that "keeps pace" alongside. The final reaching for courage that "fits where the star was pressed" offers a non-literal answer to where courage waits—not ahead but beside us always. No explicit moralizing; meaning accrues through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("every note asks where I am willing to be carried"). Perceptual signature consistent in selecting water/tide imagery. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("Passage is a promise"). Minor compression under pressure maintains coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and information density, particularly in "We shall traverse the ridge when it appears, the second guide says, through indirect routes that your own feet will decide." Some repetitive phrasing around "vigil in twilight" (appears twice). No loops or scaffolding in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ferry guides who row on choices rather than tide offer a fresh angle on the psychopomp tradition. The concept of courage as something that "keeps pace" alongside rather than ahead transforms familiar quest structure. Some elements feel slightly derivative of spiritual journey templates.</comment>
