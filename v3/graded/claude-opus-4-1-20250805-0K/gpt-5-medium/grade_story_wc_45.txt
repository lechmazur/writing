I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and metaphorical density toward a resonant reconfiguration where healing becomes possible through the acknowledgment of shared brokenness.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's characterization as a "forgiving skeptic" who sets bones manifests beautifully through concrete actions—examining the tooth, setting Ari's shoulder, teaching Linnet patience. The internal contradiction between skepticism and mercy drives authentic choices, particularly in accepting Ari's story while acknowledging "the cleft in certainty we both could straddle." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("yearning is the honesty of the body") that briefly shifts from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the final image of stars as "bright bones of the sky, set just so that we could heal" reweights the entire narrative through the bone-setting metaphor. The cost is palpable—Ari's erosion by shame, the drowned child, the community's need for resolution through a false body. The accumulative texture coheres powerfully, though one instance of unclear causality (why exactly Ari placed the substitute body) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The secret garden functions as more than setting—it breathes "mint and iron," harbors evidence, and provides sanctuary for truth-telling. Exquisite micro-details like "the fountain muttered in a dialect of abandoned plans" and the hedge maze as "hedged constellations" constrain choices and charge the final image. The spatial choreography of bone-setting is visceral and precise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure rather than reversals—from examining evidence to discovering Ari to the physical act of healing that becomes metaphorical reconciliation. The dominant stake (transforming mistakes into constellations) deepens meaningfully when Ari's actual mistake is revealed. Cost is visible in Ari's physical and emotional erosion, though the resolution feels slightly too neat given the gravity of the deception.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the bone-setting metaphor that pervades without becoming heavy-handed: "truth, hurts first and then holds." The story resists simple morality around guilt and justice, embracing the complexity of Ari's protective lie about the changeling child. The final image of stars as witnesses rather than omens offers a resonant, non-literal answer about healing through acknowledged brokenness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"the town's voices thinned like smoke and clung to my coat." The perceptual signature is consistent: medical precision mixed with poetic observation. Dialogue (when present) carries subtext effectively, particularly Linnet's whispered secret and Ari's confession. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the narrator's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"I had set more wrists than clocks, yet everyone wanted me to set the story" establishes profession, reputation, and conflict simultaneously. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. Deduction for two instances of abstract phrasing ("yearning is the honesty of the body") and one paraphrase loop around the changeling tooth's significance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of bone-setting as both literal medical practice and metaphor for truth-telling is fresh and specific. The transformation of astronomical mapping into moral navigation ("turn mistakes into constellations") shows genuine ingenuity. The piece commits fully to its lyrical mode without retreating into conventional narrative, though it echoes familiar literary territory around community scapegoating.</comment>
