<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to decode temple inscriptions through patient observation creates clear internal consistency, with embodied details like "ink-stained and awake" and "my throat knew the cadence." The collaboration with Mara shows contradictory impulses (solitary chronicler opening to shared witness) that earn the final choice to continue witnessing together, though some interiority relies on abstract phrases like "midnight solace" rather than fully embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where shared reading transforms both isolation and understanding—"through shared burdens we learned meaning." The pattern of variable stars as grammar builds coherently toward the revelation that decoding requires dialogue not solitude, with clear cost in abandoning solitary practice for collaborative witness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choices through its instruments ("scope," "sextant," "arrays") and the variable stars themselves become the decoding mechanism. Sensory details like "paper released a breath of fields" and "daylily rasp my knuckle" are selective and purposeful, though some descriptions lean abstract ("sanctuary of slow light").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from solitary decoding to collaborative revelation, with the telegram creating urgency and Mara's arrival forcing the narrator from isolation into shared practice. The deepening occurs when they discover decoding requires conversation—"To decode temple inscriptions, we must read them aloud to someone willing to answer"—with clear cost in surrendering solitary mastery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mirror-pilgrimage story and enacted practice of shared burden-bearing, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final insight that "healing travels fastest by ordinary words" resonates through accumulated particulars of their collaborative reading, with the daylily serving as a physical anchor for connection across distance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyric compression ("Midnight hush pooled") and scientific precision ("Flux became syllable, magnitude a verb"). The perceptual signature remains consistent—a chronicler who thinks in star patterns and inscriptions—though dialogue between narrator and Mara could show more distinct lexical variation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in passages like "Stars brightened and faded, and we took down their music as carefully as surgeons." Some abstract phrasing ("midnight solace," "tender quiet") and occasional template structures ("She said... I said...") prevent higher scoring, but no loops or scaffolding mar the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of astronomy and temple decoding through variable stars as linguistic key offers genuine originality. The specific detail of the daylily-pressed telegram and the transformation of solitary scholarship into collaborative witness avoids generic templates, though some metaphysical concepts remain somewhat abstract.</comment>
