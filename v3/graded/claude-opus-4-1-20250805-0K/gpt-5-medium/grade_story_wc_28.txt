<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's complex identity as "gentle radical" with "arms of steel" and "heart undecided between heat and frost" creates genuine internal contradiction that drives choices throughout. The renaming sequences reveal character through concrete micro-choices under pressure, particularly in handling both the boy's mother and the fire-feeders with "aberrant mercy." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("warm coldness") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught renaming ritual that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the fire-feeders accept new names tied to reparative work. The cost is visible in "sullen" men kneeling and the crowd's "breath...like a warm coat of frost." Orientation anchors established early (plaza, post-fire, narrator's role), and the closure lands with "the work begins to move them."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The plaza functions as active setting that "whispers through cracks" and "tightens around us," constraining choices through its mosaic patterns that guide renamings. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("ash drifted in slow halos," "shadows climb my wrists"). The tessera and bottle caps become micro-settings that shape decisions, though some descriptions remain abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of post-fire healing/justice escalates from individual renaming (Asha) to confronting the fire-feeders, with pressure building through "the plaza tightens around us, the past marching through like a procession." The narrator's choice to rename rather than punish shows agency with clear cost. Some middle sections lack active pressure, relying on reflection rather than dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of restorative justice versus retribution emerges organically through the renaming acts, with the final image of renamed men beginning their work offering a non-literal answer to handling collective harm. The concept of "aberrant mercy" that "refuses to step back from the flames that made it necessary" resonates without moralizing, though carries risk of thematic echo in phrasing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("markets that no longer cry," "prayer that forgot its god and kept its music") maintains consistency throughout. First-person narration controls distance well, modulating between intimate reflection and external observation. Some elevated diction ("retrocognitively trapped") occasionally strains POV plausibility but serves the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong imagistic prose with purposeful rhythm variations, though some passages border on overwriting ("wind moved like a careful surgeon"). Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional abstract loops ("warm coldness, a brazier hidden inside armor") and some template-like parallel structures in the renaming sequences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The renaming-as-justice concept offers fresh angle on post-conflict healing, with specific details like using bottle caps and mosaic patterns to divine new names. The transformation of perpetrators into named roles of service (Bearer, Tanner, Chisel, Watch) feels earned rather than convenient, though the mystical element of the plaza "speaking" names risks derivative magical realism.</comment>
