I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal chains, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where rekindling the beacon transforms isolation into belonging.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The custodian's motivation to "prove that coincidences have meaning" drives concrete actions throughout—adjusting mirrors, charting sun angles, recognizing patterns in the traveler's map. The final choice to trust Lio's map and insert the shard shows contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. faith in pattern) acting simultaneously, with visible cost in the community's arrival changing solitude to belonging.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the beacon's rekindling transforms the protagonist from isolated custodian to community anchor, with clear cost (solitude traded for belonging). The accumulative lens holds as details layer—star paths, the shard's silence, Lio's arrival—building to "we rekindled more than light; we rekindled the grammar of belonging." Who/where/when anchored early through "beacon-tower custodian" and "ravaged saltlands."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The glass pavilion functions as active setting—its humming ribs must be tuned, its underside holds crucial star paths, its structure enables the beacon. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "milk-pale and cool" shard, phosphor poured into lantern cup, the beam that "exhaled like a sleeper releasing a dream." The pavilion constrains choices by requiring specific alignments and modifications.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: failed attempts with the broken prism, Lio's arrival with the missing piece, the revelation about the shard's purpose, successful rekindling that draws community. The dominant stake (proving coincidences have meaning) tightens when Lio's map matches the etchings "almost perfectly," forcing the choice to trust pattern over skepticism with visible cost in transformed isolation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accumulated particulars: star paths matching dreams, Lio's mother charting meteors on the day the ancestor etched tracks, "coincidence as stitch" not shrug. The ending reweights all prior patterns without stating a moral—"the sound that coincidences make when meaning opens" offers resonant answer to whether patterns matter, earned through specific dramatized convergences.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "retrocognitively blessed" shapes how the narrator experiences the pavilion's memories, creating unique phrases like "yesterday breathing from the panes." Voice modulates with discovery ("The realization arrived quiet as frost"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("grammar of belonging") slightly strains the established voice but remains largely coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("stories snipped by winds that sounded like scissors being cleaned"). Information density high—most sentences advance multiple purposes. Minor repetitive structures appear ("By night...by day," "We taught them...we stitched") and occasional elevated diction ("choreography," "semaphore") creates slight register drift, but momentum and clarity remain intact through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with mystical perception creates non-obvious angle—a custodian who hears building memories seeking pattern in catastrophe's aftermath. The specific detail of "shard of hush" as compressed sound and its integration into the prism shows genuine invention. Risk in the lyric-accumulative structure pays off, though some elements feel slightly familiar (beacon-lighting as community restoration).</comment>
