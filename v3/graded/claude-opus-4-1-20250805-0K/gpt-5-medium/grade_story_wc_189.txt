<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's patient, observational stance drives the central choice with genuine internal conflict between staying/leaving, though the resolution feels slightly predetermined. The jade cicada functions as a concrete anchor for transformation, and the character's method of "tangential approach" manifests consistently through sideways seeing and tidepool metaphors.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases toward the decisive "Yes" that reweights the entire pause, though the cost could be more visceral. The closure lands through Decisive Change with the narrator choosing inland migration, but the emotional price remains somewhat abstract despite the "extend the coast" resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto setting constrains the conversation physically while tidal imagery permeates perception and decision-making. Sensory details like "dripped like a slow metronome" and "sea glass light" are selective and purposeful, though some passages drift toward the abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pause itself becomes the pressure vessel, with stakes crystallizing around love versus career/archives. The narrator's decision to go inland carries cost through what will be lost (daily tides, familiar rhythms), though the tension could tighten more dramatically.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cicada's metamorphosis metaphor elegantly parallels the narrator's transformation without stating it directly. Theme emerges through the concept of "transition periods" and "star fed hinges," with the final kiss to the cicada and tucking between "notebook and heart" offering resonant closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical density with distinctive perceptual signature ("I listened the way I catalog reefs"). Some passages risk overwriting ("star fed hinges," "littorals") but the controlled rhythm and tidepool-chronicler perspective hold throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in "I will..." repetitions, and some abstract passages ("texture of time") lack concrete grounding, though the writing remains competent overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tidepool chronicler's sideways perception offers a fresh angle on the stay/leave dilemma. The concept of examining transition periods through marine observation creates originality, though the resolution's metaphorical extension feels somewhat safe.</comment>
