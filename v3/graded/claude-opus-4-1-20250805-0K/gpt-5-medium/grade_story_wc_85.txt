I'll evaluate this story through the lens of Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's guilt manifests through embodied details like "the ledger aches with forgery" and contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the beach search scene. The final choice to burn most archives while keeping one page shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("tempered regret") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator discovers his suppressed role in Abel's death and releases the forged archives to the sea, with Mara's forgiveness reweighting the entire premise. The accumulative structure coheres through the driftwood archive motif. Slight deduction for the watch hand's convenience as a found object exactly where needed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and forgotten beach create atmospheric pressure, with driftwood serving as both setting element and constraint on choices. The "sieved hush" functions as environmental texture that charges key moments. The tidal imagery throughout reinforces theme, though some descriptions lean toward the picturesque rather than fully constraining action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from meeting Mara to beach search to revelation to archive burning, each beat deepens the weight of withheld truth. The discovery that the narrator was saved by Abel creates genuine reversal with cost. The forgiveness arrives perhaps too easily given the betrayal's magnitude, slightly softening the pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between manufactured and authentic memory, with the driftwood archive serving as physical manifestation of truth versus forgery. The final image of belief that "can lose a hand and still point to what remains" offers resonant non-literal answer to questions of incomplete truth and redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with selective perception ("the sea breathing like a tired archivist") and controlled rhythm. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("You invented me"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("the sentence landed as soft as a stone") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("curled into driftwood like letters addressed to no one") and some paraphrase loops around the forgery theme that don't add new pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of forged genealogy as both profession and personal burden offers fresh angle on memory and identity. The driftwood archive system is inventive worldbuilding. The revelation of narrator's hidden role transforms familiar guilt narrative, though the resolution's tidiness slightly diminishes risk.</comment>
