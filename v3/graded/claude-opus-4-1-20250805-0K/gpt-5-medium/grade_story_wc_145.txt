I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece. The narrative builds through pattern recognition, condensation imagery, and gradual discovery rather than causal plot turns. The closure arrives through resonant reconfiguration when the narrator witnesses and records the rivers' convergence.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "find where the rivers begin" drives consistent action through observation and interpretation. The character's "dry wit" and "subtle confidence" manifest in precise, understated choices like reading condensation patterns and trusting cryptic instructions. Internal contradiction appears when fearing the map will "tame what should remain wild" while still recording, though the final acceptance of this paradox feels earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where discovering the rivers' "singular convergence" transforms the narrator from skeptical editor to witness/clerk of natural governance. The cost is legible in accepting that "water that begins as one must learn to part again" - acknowledging both connection and inevitable separation. The accumulative lens holds consistently through pattern-reading and gradual revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen lake, rusted outpost, and condensation patterns actively constrain and enable discovery - the protagonist must read moisture on glass to navigate. Sensory hierarchy reflects the editor's selective attention to patterns and texts. The valves "like hard hearts, aching to be turned and forgiven" charge the climactic convergence with embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation occurs through accumulative deepening as condensation patterns lead to reeds, then culvert, then valves, each revelation narrowing the path forward. The dominant stake - finding where rivers begin - intensifies through physical journey and interpretive acts. Cost appears in accepting the role of "clerk and herald" who must document what should "remain wild."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between mapping/naming and wildness, crystallizing in "naming follows listening, the way a scar follows an honest wound." The rivers' governance metaphor ("voting, a quorum of thawed decisions") avoids explicit moralizing while offering resonant commentary on natural systems and human witness. The final image of water learning "to part again" reweights the entire search.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines cartographic precision with lyric compression: "all creak and frost and worrying tranquility." The perceptual signature - an editor reading landscape like text - remains consistent. Purposeful fragments and compressed syntax ("Find, it urged in reed, in guttural hush") enhance rather than obscure meaning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The lake held its breath, and the girders hummed like teeth pressed tight." Some figurative density in places ("small sun trying to herald morning from thin, blue ribs") but always pattern-consistent. Strong propulsion through varied syntax and strategic compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of reading landscape through condensation patterns offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of cartography, natural systems, and linguistic interpretation feels organic and earned. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and compressed prose style heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
