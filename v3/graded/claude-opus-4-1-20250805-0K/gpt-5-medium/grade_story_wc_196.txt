<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation crystallizes through embodied details—pressing forehead to window, pinching proof "as if it might flee"—with internal contradiction between being "broken-hearted" yet "tactfully hopeful." The final choice to document and preserve the button shows values hierarchy with visible emotional cost ("My heart still hurt, but it had company").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout with dust patterns building toward the Resonant Reconfiguration where the archivist transforms from passive recorder to active preserver, creating "bridges, not perfect, but spanning where footsteps feared water." Cost is legible in the emotional weight of documenting lives that end at "emancipation, a door thrown open onto darkness we pretend is sky."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The file room functions as micro-setting with dust patterns constraining discovery ("stippled, not smooth, as if a careful bird had pecked out a breadcrumb map"). Setting actively shapes the archivist's choices through physical details like shelf positions and box conditions, though broader environmental pressure could strengthen.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation from reading dust patterns to discovering the button to recognizing the counselor's fingerprints, each revelation tightening the archivist's understanding. The cost manifests in choosing to engage with painful histories rather than merely archive them, though a more decisive foreclosure of options would elevate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the accumulation of "small kindnesses embedded in rigid forms" without stating morals. The final image of dust "composing tomorrow's map one soft mote at a time" offers a non-literal answer about how unnoticed gestures create meaning, reweighting all prior dust imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through dust-reading expertise ("A diagonal swipe shows an impatient hand") and specific diction like "cardboard coffin" and "talc-gray air." Voice maintains consistency through emotional pressure, though occasional elevation ("corridors" vs "caverns") slightly exceeds the archivist's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The dust around it was stippled, not smooth, as if a careful bird had pecked out a breadcrumb map"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("I am broken-hearted"/"My heart still hurt") and filter verbs accumulate in places ("I recognized," "I knew," "I imagined") but don't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on archival work through dust-reading as emotional archaeology transforms familiar material. The specific synthesis of bureaucratic documentation with tactile discovery feels earned, though the safety of choosing pure kindness over moral ambiguity limits risk-taking.</comment>
