I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece. The narrative builds through sensory details, phase transitions, and the metaphor of tracking invisible things, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist leaves the gold fleck behind—a gesture that reweights her relationship to the past.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's compulsion despite claustrophobia creates genuine internal contradiction acted out through embodied details like "pressed my face to granite and measured the air seam with my lips." The final choice to leave the gold fleck lands with earned emotional cost, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("Tracking invisible things is a way of believing that the world will notice me back").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through leaving the gold fleck—"The machine had enough of me and more of them"—with visible cost after honoring the dead. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and phase transitions build toward this moment of release. Minor orientation delay (cave location) doesn't harm closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Environment actively constrains every choice: "The entrance squeeze pinched my ribs like a hand I owed money," tidal timing creates urgency, phase transitions enable entry. The facility's decay mirrors abandonment themes. Setting functions as character through lived-in details like "Fluorescents slept overhead like seals."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through tidal pressure and the narrowing window for escape, with the protagonist's need to honor the dead creating moral weight. The cost manifests in leaving the gold fleck—surrendering her talisman. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers her name in the system, though physical danger could intensify more sharply.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "tracking invisible things" and being noticed back, culminating in the protagonist ensuring others are remembered. The final image of leaving the gold fleck resonantly answers whether connection requires possession. Minor deduction for one instance of stated theme ("a way of believing that the world will notice me back").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through technical precision ("phase transitions," "fault currents") mixed with visceral perception ("magnetic itch of buried wire"). The perceptual signature of tracking invisible currents remains consistent. Slight register elevation in reflective passages ("guided less by courage than by compulsion") doesn't break POV but occasionally distances.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Currents slicking my skin, air seams whispering from rock, the magnetic itch of buried wire." Minor repetition of "crashing hush" and some abstract phrasing ("a way of believing") prevent higher scoring. Prose rhythm effectively modulates with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spelunking, obsolete technology, and memorial creates an original emotional landscape. The specific detail of using a gold fleck from illuminated manuscripts as a conductor, combined with phase transitions for access, shows genuine inventiveness. Risk-taking in the lyric structure and technical specificity heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
