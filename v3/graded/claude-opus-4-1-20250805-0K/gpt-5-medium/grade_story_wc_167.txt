<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glazier's meditation on craft and community shows consistent motivation through concrete details like the pond ritual and the boy's question about windows holding families. Internal conflict between artistic vision and commercial pressures plays out through embodied perception and micro-choices. The final renunciation of spectacle for communal memory lands with felt cost, though some passages drift into abstraction ("debts to wonder") rather than staying grounded in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as the piece builds through layered images of glass, water, and light toward a resonant reconfiguration where the glazier commits to preserving communal memory in the atrium design. The pond divination scene meaningfully deepens the stakes and provides the tactical shift. Closure lands with conceptual cost as "we were its light first" reweights the entire development project, though the middle section's pacing occasionally stalls on reflection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pearl Bay's dawn setting and the pond behind the bait shack provide tactile anchors that constrain choices—the glazier must read the water's patterns for guidance. Sensory details like "sunlight smells like tar and yeast" and "gulls return to their litigations" create lived-in specificity. The ferry ramp's ghost within architectural lines charges the final design choice, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of environment constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving authentic community memory versus commercial spectacle—intensifies through the pond consultation and the boy's appearance. The glazier's decision to incorporate ferry boards and tide maps into the design represents meaningful agency with visible trade-offs. Escalation coheres under the accumulative lens as details compound toward the final stance, though middle passages could tighten their pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the glazier's craft metaphor: "mend light as if it were cracked like ordinary panes" becomes a meditation on preserving what development threatens to erase. The boy's question about windows holding families crystallizes the thematic tension without stating it. The ending's "we were its light first" offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior material about value in the mundane.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains a craftsman's philosophical register with distinctive perceptual signatures like "gossip sketches currents that a chart will never admit." The lyric compression and metaphorical density suit the reflective mode. Dialogue with the boy feels natural and advances the thematic question, though occasional drift into elevated diction ("noctilucent reckonings") slightly strains the POV's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("I polish the harbor windows until they recall the sea that once invented them") but suffers from occasional paraphrase loops and abstract passages that slow momentum. Lines like "debts to wonder are not settled by closing time" and "clarity has a price, but it can also be a wage" restate similar concepts without adding pressure. Information density varies; stronger when grounded in concrete action, weaker in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The glazier-philosopher archetype and pond divination method offer fresh angles on development tension. The specific synthesis of craft knowledge with communal memory—reading water patterns to design glass—feels non-obvious yet earned. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens thematic resonance, though the contemplative pace may limit broader appeal.</comment>
