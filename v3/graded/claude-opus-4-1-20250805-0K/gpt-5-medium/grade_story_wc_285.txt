<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The coachman's patient awareness and Wren's transformation of materials show consistent character-specific motivation, with the final crossing earned through their established traits. Internal states manifest through concrete actions like threading moonlight and stitching the map. The choice to cross and complete their work carries visible cost through the physical effort against current and emotional weight of the "palimpsest promise."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens governs as imagery and ritual actions build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the map-stitching transforms both characters' relationship to their burdens. The closure lands with felt cost as "the palimpsest promise settle[s] like a cloak, not erasing, but warming the scars." Opening orientation is deliberately atmospheric but anchors the coachman, river crossing, and waiting stance adequately.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fog-bound river setting actively constrains perception and movement, forcing the ferry crossing that becomes the story's crucible. Sensory detail like "Water slapped the hull like a dog too tired to fetch" grounds the physical journey. The environment literally shapes the final transformation as "the hills looked less like burdens and more like breathing."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on completing the promised crossing and transforming fear through the map-stitching ritual, with the river's current providing physical resistance at the midpoint. The deepening occurs through accumulation of textile metaphors and physical actions rather than reversals. Cost manifests in accepting rather than erasing scars, though the physical struggle could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of braiding/stitching disparate elements into coherent meaning, with the palimpsest concept of writing over without erasing the past. The yarn needle functions as both literal tool and thematic anchor for threading "what you see through what you cannot." The ending achieves resonance as movement forward incorporates rather than abandons the past.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice maintains consistent metaphorical register ("Mist braided the dawn") with purposeful compression serving the accumulative design. POV remains stable with the coachman's patient, attentive perspective filtering all perception. Dialogue carries subtext effectively, particularly "You look like rain" and Wren's instructions about the map.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of striking imagery but suffers from occasional opacity ("spindrift serenity") and some metaphorical density that obscures rather than clarifies. Lines like "Every pierce of the cloth sounded small and true, a heartbeat found again" demonstrate strong rhythmic control. Some passages require multiple readings for basic comprehension, creating momentum drag in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The palimpsest metaphor offers a fresh angle on transformation narratives, avoiding simple erasure for layered accumulation. Specific details like stitching moonlight and the map "patched with letters from her mother" create memorable imagery. The piece commits to its lyric-accumulative mode though some metaphorical choices feel strained.</comment>
