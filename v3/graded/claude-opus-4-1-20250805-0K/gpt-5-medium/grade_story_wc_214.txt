I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered metaphors and sensory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the narrator and station achieve "flourishing stillness" together.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's spiritual curiosity drives concrete actions (polishing with lantern glass, keeping a notebook of stories, kneeling to align ears with panels) that reveal layered motivations. The final choice to open the roof "as far as it would move" demonstrates agency through attention rather than action, with visible vulnerability ("afraid and grateful and ready"). Internal contradiction between hiding and transparency plays out through embodied details like "balanced both in my lungs."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "flourishing stillness again, not empty, but full of spared collision" - the station and narrator enter mutual recognition with felt cost (vulnerability exposed to ice and meteors). The accumulative structure coheres as sensory details (copper smell, yellow light, meteor streaks) build toward the final crystallization. Cost is legible in "I told the sky I was afraid" and the meteors' respectful withdrawal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The station functions as living setting that constrains choices - its "pulse points where fear and wonder held hands" guide the narrator's maintenance rituals. The yellow lantern glass transforms from cleaning tool to ceremonial object ("like a small sun"), charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the janitor's priorities: copper and old tea smells, the texture of fingerprints holding "tired hopes like fossil pollen."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from physical maintenance to spiritual communion as the narrator learns to read the station's moods through meteor correlations. The power failure forces heightened vulnerability, narrowing options to pure attention with the lantern glass. The meteors' final withdrawal ("respecting the old boundary") demonstrates earned agency through accumulated understanding rather than confrontation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "flourishing stillness" - finding strength through vulnerability and maintenance rather than grand gestures. The station's memories of being "told to wait" mirror the narrator's own "long pause before truth." The final image of "spared collision" resonates as both literal (meteors turning away) and metaphorical (healing through transparency), avoiding any stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice merges technical precision ("relay," "vacuum valve") with lyrical perception ("sky murmured to my bucket"). The perceptual signature shows selective attention to decay and persistence - "fossil pollen," "pulse points," "patient animal unbending its ribs." Rhythm modulates from meditative observation to urgent presence during the power failure, maintaining coherent texture throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "I swept stardust from the floor" establishes role, setting, and cosmic scale simultaneously. Syntactic variety supports the accumulative structure without loops or scaffolding. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("primal elegance of maintenance") but figurative language generally serves pressure, especially "honeyed light draped the gauges like shawls."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of a janitor achieving cosmic communion through maintenance work transforms the overlooked-worker trope through specific detail. The correlation method between meteor streaks and machine moods offers fresh insight into attention as agency. The station as sentient-but-not-anthropomorphized entity avoids cliché through concrete memories tied to specific humans.</comment>
