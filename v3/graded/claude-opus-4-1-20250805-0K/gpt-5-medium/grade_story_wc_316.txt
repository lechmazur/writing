I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and complementary opposites toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's journey from "ego death survivor" to choosing joint custody shows genuine transformation through embodied states ("frost after the void," "old ice crack"). Neri and Rae emerge as distinct yet complementary forces with specific traits. The resolution feels earned through the narrator's unique position as one who "crawled back from nothing."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where joint custody becomes the only viable solution, with cost visible in "They did not cheer, and neither did I." The accumulative structure coheres through complementary opposites pattern. Who/where/when anchors establish by ~100 words ("floating rock dojo," "that week").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating dojo with clouds passing underneath creates distinctive atmosphere that mirrors the training philosophy. "History rewrites itself" as temporal distortion adds pressure. Setting constrains the solution through the dojo's specific practice methods, though some details remain ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes build from personal numbness to collective custody decision, with the jar's consciousness as the true arbiter ("sending little gusts of static to our teeth"). The training sequences escalate toward the final test where "alternating current" becomes essential. Cost registers in the understated non-celebration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the complementary opposites philosophy applied to identity, custody, and healing. The river memory ("learned both fear and joy") crystallizes the lesson without stating it. Final image of the "vivified" future resonates backward through all the training.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends philosophical ("ego death survivor") with visceral ("taste of river stones"). Perceptual signature strong in synesthetic details like "static to our teeth." Controlled psychic distance moves between immediate sensation and reflective understanding without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines like "whose laugh had once broken a tyrant." Some metaphoric density in early sections ("masks painted on glass") but rhythm varies purposefully. Information delivery efficient, each image earning its place in the accumulative structure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The clone custody battle framework freshly explores identity and healing through martial arts philosophy. "Brain in a jar labeled duplicate" as consciousness-arbiter shows genuine originality. The synthesis of sci-fi elements with embodied training practice feels organic and earned.</comment>
