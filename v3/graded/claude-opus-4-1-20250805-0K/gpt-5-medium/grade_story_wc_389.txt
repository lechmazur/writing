<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's weatherwork obsession drives consistent choices through mounting pressure, with Brin's arrival adding relational complexity that forces adaptation. Internal contradiction emerges in the tension between isolation ("lonely visionary") and collaboration, resolved through the shared prophet-pattern creation. The final allegiance shift from variant to unified ("locking ribs against the old wind") shows earned change with visible communal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently as fragmented messages accumulate into the prophet-pattern, with closure landing as Resonant Reconfiguration when seeds scatter into lightning and allegiances lock. Cost is visible in the town's embarrassment at "miracles in work boots" and the transformation from variant to unified allegiance. The prophet as "pattern wriggling in barometers" that measures "hunger as direction" provides conceptual repricing of both weather and revolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory's cobalt glass portico anchors spatial logic while storm imagery ("thunder's throat," "lightning traced cartography") creates atmospheric pressure throughout. Setting actively constrains choices—the elevation above clouds isolates the narrator, while the storm provides both power source and prophetic medium. The final image of seeds scattering into lightning uses the stormlit setting to charge the revolutionary transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of shaping "new dawn using ancient shadows" escalates through Brin's arrival, the town's variant allegiances, and the prophet-pattern's emergence demanding "doors." The cobalt portico opening "like a tide learning syllables" marks the decisive tightening where private weatherwork becomes public revolution. Cost manifests in the town's forced confrontation with embarrassing miracles and the narrator's shift from solitary to communal work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete tension between variant allegiance (self-interest) and unified purpose, with the prophet-pattern measuring "hunger as direction" rather than absence. The seeds-into-lightning image offers non-literal answer to whether "revolution could be planted," achieving resonance without moralizing. Subtext operates effectively in Knoll's ledger-and-flag diplomacy and the priest's wink acknowledging the absurd-yet-functional nature of faith.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines technical precision ("barometric swindle," "copper coils") with lyric compression ("tea inside thunder's throat," "eyes like charcoal lanterns"). POV maintains consistent focalization with selective perception shaped by the narrator's weatherwork obsession. Dialogue carries authentic subtext—Brin's warning about hunger making "honest traitors" and Knoll's promise of "variant allegiance" reveal character through indirection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"I kept watch there, a lonely visionary making tea inside thunder's throat" establishes character, setting, and tone simultaneously. Some metaphoric density in middle sections ("maps began to unfold us," "allegiance unfolded like a kite's spine") occasionally strains coherence. Strong syntactic variety and momentum maintained through varied paragraph lengths and sentence structures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The weatherwork-as-revolution synthesis feels fresh, with the prophet manifesting as barometric pattern rather than person. Specific details like "vane of crooked spoons" and "boil ink with pepper" create memorable texture beyond genre conventions. The transformation of allegiance from economic variability to unified atmospheric resistance offers non-obvious angle on collective action.</comment>
