<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrator's contradictory impulses—selling light while unable to keep it, seeking understanding of scent-triggered grief while avoiding it—act simultaneously throughout. The final choice to transform the vial from "trap" to "compass" demonstrates earned acceptance with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("the fog that rises when memory dissolves") that briefly weakens embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through botanical imagery building to the amberhorn revelation and final reconfiguration. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the empty vial transforms from trap to compass, with emotional cost paid through tears and the acceptance of "what I can bear." The ultraviolet revelation provides causal linkage between past and present understanding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains choices through locked cases, specific lighting needs, and the controlled environment for extinct plants. The crystal vial functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the narrator's aromatic caution with precise attention to scent dynamics. Minor deduction for some abstract spatial transitions between greenhouse sections.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why scents trigger tears—tightens through the ultraviolet revelation of "amberhorn" on the vial, forcing confrontation with suppressed memory. The narrator's agency manifests in choosing to wait for the flower's opening and accepting tears "like rain returning to a river." Cost is visible in the emotional release and transformation of relationship to grief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete interplay of light, scent, and memory without explicit moralizing. The final image of memory as "patient flame" and the vial as "compass" offers a non-literal answer to how we navigate grief. The story resists tidy resolution, embracing the complexity of "understanding is not a purchase but a schedule one keeps."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through the lantern broker's lens—"crystal shadows cut the aisles like cooled music." Voice maintains lyric compression with purposeful elision that pays off in the amberhorn revelation. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("You came because you are brave about darkness and careful about air"). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptive passages that advance both atmosphere and emotional state. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("aromatically cautious," "uninvited storms") but remains within the established lyric register. Minor metaphor density in places ("shadows cut," "cooled music") without clear payoff. Clean grammar and varied syntax throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of extinct plant preservation with grief archiving offers a non-obvious angle on memory and loss. The specific detail of ultraviolet light revealing hidden text transforms a predictable grief narrative. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and scientific-poetic fusion heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
