<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "learn to navigate without moving" drives concrete micro-choices (tying the arrowhead, tuning breath to birds, holding still), with embodied sensory details like "I press my thumbs to the arrowhead." The final renunciation of physical movement for sonic navigation carries visible cost ("I leave the remaining stones...keep the cord empty"), though internal contradiction could be sharper during the transformation moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through bird patterns, bone resonance, and the wandering pulse building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where stillness enables travel ("Hold still, and the world will carry you"). The cost is legible in leaving behind the stones and accepting emptiness ("a lesson coiled around nothing"), with the wandering pulse "less alone for having been heard" marking genuine change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canyon's bone towers and black mirror pool constrain the narrator's method—they must listen rather than move, using the environment's acoustic properties. Setting details like "ribs leaning into a sky that forgot how to be blue" and "stratified echoes" are filtered through the skimmer's professional perception, with the final image of birds settling "as dusk flares" charging the transformed state.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning stillness-based navigation—deepens through accumulating sonic layers (stones humming, birds braiding, pulse stuttering) that force the narrator to abandon their traditional skimming practice. The cost appears in surrendering familiar tools ("I leave the remaining stones"), though the middle section could show more resistance before acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete paradox of movement through stillness, with the arrowhead as "every tool was first a prayer" and the ancestors who "might have listened for a map that arrives as rhythm." The final image of the pulse going on "less alone for having been heard" offers a non-literal answer about connection across time without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "sky that forgot how to be blue" and "birds shear toward the sun and then arc back in a dish of light," with controlled rhythm shifts from longer meditative sentences to the short imperative "Hold still." The lyric compression serves the accumulative design, though occasional elevated diction ("historically reverent") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Stories said the canyon kept a pulse left wandering, a rhythm broken free from any living heart"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("feathers ticked with dust like soot") but mostly purposeful, with clear propulsion toward the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of sonic navigation replacing physical movement offers a fresh angle on journey narratives, with specific details like using bird patterns as "grammar of the air." The synthesis of ancient practice with personal discovery feels earned, though the premise of sound-based travel isn't entirely unprecedented in speculative fiction.</comment>
