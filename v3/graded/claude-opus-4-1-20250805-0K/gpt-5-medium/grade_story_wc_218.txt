<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's acceptance of death while choosing "work over sorrow" creates authentic internal contradiction, with embodied details like "I slept between the rows, a journal under my cheek." The final renunciation ("I was not leaving, only returning") carries visible cost through the physical deterioration ("my breath grew thin") and the conscious choice to give up the diary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear accumulative/textural structure builds through copper wire tuning, architectural secrets revealed as relationships, and community integration, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where death becomes "returning to the woven map we had made." The cost is unmistakable in "I began to tire in the afternoons, as promised" and the final laying down, with the pillars' "slow chord" confirming the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The living stone pillars that "hummed when I put my ear to their shade" and had "appetite for pattern" actively constrain choices throughout—the narrator must work with their preferences for almond pollen, their responses guide the copper wire placement, and they "leaned approvingly" at the otter ramps. The environment literally shapes the remodel and charges the final image of becoming part of "the woven map."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation occurs through accumulative deepening: from solitary wire-setting to community involvement ("People came with laughter and suspicion"), to interspecies integration (otters, herons, crabs), to council formation, finally narrowing to the narrator's physical decline and conscious surrender. The cost is legible in lost stamina and the final relinquishment of the diary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that "architectural secrets were not diagrams but relationships, negotiated with candor and kindness," avoiding abstraction. The final image of "returning to the woven map we had made" offers a non-literal answer about death as integration rather than departure, with the otters' "wet hands like blessing" confirming communal acceptance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature evident in phrases like "the tide confirmed their sentence in its patient pull" and "Death watched from the surf like a patient gull." The lyric compression serves the accumulative structure, though occasional elevation ("brazen calm etched into errands") slightly strains the caretaker's voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The copper sang faintly, an insect choir corrected by the living stone until pitch met pulse"). Some figurative density in places ("sentences of labor," "white alphabet") but serves the lyric mode. Minor template cadence in middle sections ("I learned...I told them...I showed them") reduces momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of living stone pillars with "mineral leaves" that actively participate in the orchard's design is genuinely fresh. The transformation of death from ending to integration ("returning to the woven map") and the specific synthesis of botanical knowledge with geological consciousness creates an inevitable-feeling yet non-obvious resolution.</comment>
