I'll evaluate this story through the lens of Accumulative/Textural design, as it builds through lyric repetition and image patterns toward a resonant reconfiguration where trust returns through the act of releasing the pigeons.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to preserve lost songs while battling past betrayal creates genuine internal conflict acted out through concrete choices. The progression from isolation to tentative connection with the violinist shows embodied change through specific actions (sending hymn fragments, mapping dust, releasing the choir). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around trust that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator releases the pigeon choir and "feels a hinge loosen where suspicion had rusted it shut" - trust returns with visible cost (the attic clearing, the risk of another betrayal). The accumulative structure coheres through dust-mapping, pigeon-training, and music-exchange patterns. Slight opacity around the mars meteorite's function prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The attic setting actively constrains choices through the skylight's dust motes that guide pigeon routes, while the bookshop's imminent clearing creates pressure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("dust sweet," "papery sighs," "bruised tulip folding"). The environment directly enables the final act when dust shows "a corridor of gentle drift."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: tentative exchanges with violinist, bookshop closure announcement tightening time, final risk of sending the full choir. The dominant stake (learning to trust again) deepens when the narrator must choose between preservation and connection. Cost is visible but the middle section could show more concrete pressure points.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of pigeons carrying messages as trust vessels. The final image of pigeons carrying "both ways at once, toward remembering and toward mercy" offers a non-literal answer to the trust question. The mars meteorite as calibrator of doubt and music as shared language avoid abstraction while building resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout ("I train courier pigeons among the foxed atlases"). Lyric compression and patterned repetition serve the accumulative design while maintaining clarity. Voice modulates effectively from meditative opening to urgent middle ("I hurry to copy") to expansive ending without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The motes reveal roomsized winds, small currents that crumple messages or cradle them"). Clean propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks. Minor repetition of "paper trails" and some abstract phrasing around trust prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of a pigeon trainer preserving lost songs in a bookshop attic while learning to trust through musical exchange feels fresh and specific. The mars meteorite as doubt-calibrator and dust-reading as navigation method show inventive detail. Execution is strong though not groundbreaking in form.</comment>
