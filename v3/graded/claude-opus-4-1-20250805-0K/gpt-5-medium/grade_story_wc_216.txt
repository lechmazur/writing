I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to understand time's texture after numbers fail is embodied through concrete actions—keeping shifts, studying artifacts, posting coded messages. The relationship with Lio forces a choice to open the capsule "not by force, but by patience," revealing the narrator's forgotten childhood memory of counting time by cricket calls, a revelation that lands with emotional specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator recovers the lost memory of learning to count by tremor with their mother, reweighting all prior time-keeping attempts. The accumulative structure coheres as fragments (urn, capsule, garage sales) build toward this recovery of pre-numeric time-sensing, with visible cost in the years of forgetting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The emerald silo functions as more than setting—its "wheat ghosts" and glass that "glowed like bottled pasture" create a liminal space where time can be re-learned. Sensory details like "receipts that tasted like rainstorms" and "a pocketknife that cut dust" make the altered world tactile and constraining, forcing new methods of measurement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal timekeeping to communal reconstruction as neighbors arrive with "damaged time capsules, jars that had swallowed arguments." The narrator's agency manifests through patient waiting and the choice to walk the footprint-letter, with cost visible in the "borrowed heart" that must learn when to be "metronome" versus "river stone."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that time can be measured by texture, tremor, and cricket calls rather than numbers—a non-literal answer to living after systemic failure. The final image of people following "soft thunder" resonates without moralizing, suggesting community can be rebuilt through shared sensory attention.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through inventive constructions like "clocks coughed colors" and "calendars barked at dusk," creating a perceptual signature where time has physical, sensory properties. The consistent POV filters everything through this synesthetic lens without slippage, making abstraction concrete.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"I pocketed it because it sounded like tomorrow when tomorrow was still a place you could walk to" compresses nostalgia, loss, and hope. Minor repetition of "damaged time capsule" and some filter constructions ("I told them," "I wanted") slightly reduce momentum but don't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of time-keeping after numbers fail is genuinely fresh, executed through specific sensory substitutions (smell, touch, shadow-braiding) rather than generic post-apocalyptic tropes. The garage sale communication method and footprint-letters show inventive world-building that follows its own logic consistently.</comment>
