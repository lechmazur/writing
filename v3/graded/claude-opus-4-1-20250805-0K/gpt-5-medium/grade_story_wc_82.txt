<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lantern maker's motivation to heal grief through craft is embodied in concrete actions (polishing stones, folding steam cranes), and his shadowless state creates genuine vulnerability. The internal conflict between holding grief and releasing it plays out through physical craft rather than abstract reflection. Minor deduction for the shadow's return feeling slightly convenient despite the earned emotional groundwork.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through craft rituals toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the shadow loosens but doesn't return, showing genuine cost. The spiral staircase that "descends while ascending" anchors the dreamlike logic early. The closure lands with visible transformation—the ache "no longer drags at the world around his ankles"—though the shadow's agency could be clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating basilica and tea garden create a liminal space where physical laws bend purposefully ("descends while ascending"). Sensory details are selective and support the dreamlike logic: kettles hissing, prisms scattering rainbows, steam that can be folded. The environment actively constrains and enables the protagonist's healing ritual, making setting indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—healing from shadow loss—escalates through accumulative craft rituals that deepen rather than reverse. Each polishing and folding action builds pressure toward the shadow's approach. The cost is visible when the shadow "does not return to him, but it loosens," showing genuine trade-off between complete restoration and partial release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of crafting light from grief without explicit moralizing. The origami cranes made from steam embody the transformation of pain into something that can fly. The ending resists full resolution—the shadow loosens but doesn't return—embracing complexity over tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains dreamlike precision through selective perception ("thin as a thread of smoke," "kettles hiss"). The prose rhythm modulates with the ritual's progression, tightening during the crane-folding sequence. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("You will find our stairs familiar"), supporting the otherworldly atmosphere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("catches sky like a spoon catches sugar"), though occasional overwriting appears ("luminous torment wrapped in patient hands"). Some metaphor density in early passages without clear payoff. The final paragraph maintains clarity and momentum through the resolution.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of healing grief through lantern-making and steam origami offers fresh specificity. The shadow detachment premise avoids cliché through concrete craft details and the partial resolution. The basilica's inverted physics ("descends while ascending") creates memorable worldbuilding that serves the emotional arc.</comment>
