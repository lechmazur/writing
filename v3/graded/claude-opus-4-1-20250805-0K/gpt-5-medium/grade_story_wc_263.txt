I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through lyric accumulation of images and metaphorical actions rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to heal blocked artists through astronomical metaphor is consistent and embodied through concrete actions like tracing meteor paths and translating stellar scripts. The sculptor's transformation from "marble lungs afraid of drawing breath" to carving air shows earned change. However, the protagonist's own internal conflict remains somewhat abstract beyond the "shadowed rapture" label, lacking the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate this further.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres well, building from personal gift/curse through cosmic methodology to concrete artistic liberation. The sculptor's transformation constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("weeps as if a knot inside her unwinds"). The ending's expansion to city-wide healing and the narrator's continued role creates Charged Poise. Minor orientation wobble with the archway's physical/metaphysical nature slightly dulls precision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway functions as both setting and transformative portal, constraining the narrator's method through its astronomical alignments. Sensory details like "brass chilled and calibrated by sleeplessness" and "vellum that smells like rain" ground the fantastical. The river with its "broken oars and midnight reeds" provides textural depth. The archway's dual nature as "hinge" with the instrument as "key" makes setting essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal burden ("their silence was digging a grave inside me") through individual healing (the sculptor) to city-wide creative liberation. The seven circuits create accumulative pressure, with the meteor "combing the aurora" triggering the breakthrough. Cost appears in the narrator's ongoing burden ("the arch still hums") and the sculptor's emotional release, though the ease of subsequent healings slightly reduces tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of creative blockage and liberation emerges organically through concrete metaphors of stardust, frozen windows, and celestial translation. The final image of night "learning to speak without wounding its own silence" offers resonant resolution without stating a moral. The piece achieves genuine complexity about artistic suffering and healing, though occasionally approaches the abstract ("unwritten calendar") without full grounding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistency with astronomical/mystical register throughout, creating distinct texture through phrases like "the sky breathes in colors that whisper" and "remembered stardust that refuses to settle." Some moments achieve genuine poetry ("a dancer tied her ankles to clocks"), while others lean toward purple prose ("shadowed rapture"). The POV remains stable with appropriate perceptual filtering for this visionary narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the night repeats it in color") with strong syntactic variety and rhythm. However, abstract phrases like "unwritten calendar" appear four times without gaining precision, creating mild loops. Some sentences strain under metaphorical weight ("the instrument hums in my hands like a hive discovering spring"). Information density is generally high, though the middle section about studying sky-charts could compress further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of using astronomical observation to heal artistic blockage offers fresh synthesis of scientific and artistic domains. The specific image of translating falling stars into prescriptions for individual artists shows genuine originality. The transformation from cosmic to intimate scale works well, though the ease of the method after initial struggle reduces some boldness. The "unwritten calendar" metaphor remains somewhat generic despite repetition.</comment>
