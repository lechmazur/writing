Looking at this story, I'll evaluate it under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds meaning through layered imagery, recurring motifs, and a pattern of discovery that culminates in revelation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gardener's motivation emerges clearly through embodied action - his "tenderly organized" approach to both grief and discovery, the careful laying of tools "in a crescent that mirrors the curve of stones." His internal contradiction between being "blithe" yet "shadowed by velveteen gloom" creates authentic complexity. The final choice to honor both truth and absence with poppies shows earned character change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the gardener's discovery reweights the widow's tapestry from cryptic artifact to map of moral complexity. The cost is legible: "writes her name in loam so no one misreads absence" acknowledges both the widow's sacrifice and the lover's erasure. The accumulative structure coheres as each discovered layer (tapestry, empty grave, hidden documents) builds toward understanding "the shape of intentions."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt silo functions as more than backdrop - its "listening metal" and "uncharted echoes" actively participate in discovery. Strong sensory work: "velvet unwinding," "echoes drift down like migrating birds." The cemetery's "lunar gray" and specific flora (asters, poppies, hemlock) create lived-in specificity that constrains choices and charges the final planting decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake - discovering truth hidden among the dead - escalates through accumulating revelations that narrow options. Each discovery (frayed threads → missing grave → hidden documents) tightens pressure toward the moral choice of how to honor contradictory truths. Cost is visible in the gardener's physical wound ("palm nicked by a burr of wire") and emotional shift from "blithe" to "respect."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the widow's paradox: "wanted the world to see her faithfulness, yet also protect the living man." The tapestry's border containing "both truths at once" becomes a resonant metaphor for love's contradictions. The final image of poppies circling absence offers a non-literal answer about how memory honors both presence and departure without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "cobalt silo under stars exhales a hush that sounds like velvet unwinding." Some register elevation strains POV credibility ("monarchic sigh," "velveteen gloom") but the perceptual signature remains consistent - a gardener who reads landscapes as texts. The prose rhythm effectively modulates with discovery beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with strong moments ("coins worn smooth, a glass needle, and scraps of thread that drink the lamplight") but occasional overwriting. Mixed metaphors muddle clarity: echoes as "migrating birds" forming a "choir" in consecutive lines. Some template cadence in middle sections ("He begins... He climbs... He recognizes...") dulls momentum though the closure beat remains clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cemetery gothic with textile detective work creates an original angle on hidden histories. The widow as "clockmaker's widow who timed funerals" offers specific texture. The conceit of reading knots as "punctuation in a stubborn sentence" transforms the decoding trope through concrete metaphor that pays off in discovering "both truths at once."</comment>
