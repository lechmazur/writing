<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's dimensional homesickness and practice of "interiorizing exteriors" creates genuine internal contradiction acted out through concrete gestures like folding horizons inward. The guardian's characterization through "stacks and winter, all tenderness taught by wolves" is specific and embodied. The final choice to carry thresholds like books represents earned endurance with visible cost ("The day is thinner for a breath").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the closure achieving Resonant Reconfiguration through the narrator's transformation from dimensional exile to one who carries "thresholds like books, and books like thresholds." The cost is legible in "The day is thinner for a breath, but it holds" - showing the weight of interiorizing the garden. Who/where/when anchors establish early through "frozen garden in mist" and "feral library guardian."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen garden with its arrested sundial and mist that "writes a syllabus on my coat sleeve with thaw" actively constrains choices and enables the interiorizing method. Sensory details like "Light pools like breath on glass" and the guardian who "smells of vellum and salt" create atmosphere while the pendant's "bead of dawn" that "refuses to cross the line where the mist begins" establishes consistent world rules that shape the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of belonging/exile intensifies through the pendant test where "the bead swivels toward me...and I hear it ask where home is," forcing the narrator to articulate their stance. The cost becomes visible when "the bead keeps a sliver of my breath, a tithe to belonging elsewhere." However, the escalation remains primarily internal without strong external pressure shifts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of boundaries and translation emerges through concrete images: the sundial's "frozen mid-confession," the pendant's dawn that "refuses to cross," and the final insight about carrying doorways. The ending reweights the opening's "dimensionally homesick" into acceptance of multiplicity without stating a moral. The concept that "to cross is to forget...but to interiorize is to carry" transforms from abstract principle to lived practice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through phrases like "I am dimensionally homesick, a border-crosser who fell between shelves" and the lyric compression of "Memory smokes like ice under pressure." The controlled rhythm modulates from dreamlike opening to crystallized ending. Dialogue carries subtext effectively when the guardian "asks what I will give to stay" and the narrator offers "willingness to wait."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong moments like "Light pools like breath on glass" and "Memory smokes like ice under pressure" show figurative precision. However, abstract passages like "friendship with uncertainty requires reciprocity" and some template constructions ("She tells me...She asks...I tell her...I say") create momentum drag. The density is high but occasional abstraction ("practice foggy lucidity") lacks the concrete specificity of the best lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of library-as-threshold-space with dimensional homesickness creates a fresh angle on belonging. The specific detail of "unwritten books and off-season stars" and the guardian as cultist-librarian-wolf hybrid avoids generic fantasy. The concept of interiorizing as method for carrying worlds transforms the exile narrative beyond typical resolution.</comment>
