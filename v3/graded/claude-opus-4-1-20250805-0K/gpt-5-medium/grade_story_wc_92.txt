<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to dim the fort's oppressive luminosity is clear and consistent, with concrete micro-choices (using the bronze quill holder on locks, adjusting regulators). However, Captain Rhun's instant conversion feels undermotivated—his single-degree nod lacks the resistance or internal conflict such a reversal demands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught imagery ("winking hush," "cradle of sparks") that pays off in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the fort transforms from "spectacle to hearth." The closure lands with conceptual cost as the community discovers "their shadows are not enemies," though Rhun's conversion weakens causal pressure slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The luminous fort and underground workshops create atmospheric pressure, with sensory details like "corridor tastes of iron and rain" grounding the blackout. The bronze quill holder functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (opening locks, completing circuits), elevating beyond mere description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming the fort from oppressive surveillance to communal hearth—is signaled early and deepens through the blackout opportunity. Captain Rhun's appearance creates genuine tension, but his too-easy capitulation ("one degree, as if the sundial itself had tipped him") deflates the confrontation's potential cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast of "glare to glow," with the silent revolution achieved through consent rather than force ("consent of doors"). The final image of the protagonist as "vigilant lock sentinel, guarding consent instead of fear" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the opening without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with pattern-taught compression ("winking hush," "cradle of sparks") and controlled metaphorical language. Some register elevation feels slightly forced ("Let the fort breathe, I tell him, and it will serve rather than smother"), but overall maintains coherent perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Messages move via the coded angles in a half-painted sundial"). Minor template cadence in middle sections ("I kneel and let...," "We walk the coded angles...") and occasional overwrought metaphor ("medals dreaming of their own reflections") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The central conceit of locks as both physical and metaphorical barriers transformed through "consent" offers fresh perspective on revolution narratives. The synthesis of mother's legacy, mechanical expertise, and social transformation feels specific and earned, though Rhun's conversion could use more resistance.</comment>
