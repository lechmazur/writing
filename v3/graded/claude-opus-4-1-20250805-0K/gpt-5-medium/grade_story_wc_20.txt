I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through pattern, metaphor accumulation, and cadence shifts toward a resonant reconfiguration where the narrator accepts being "held together" rather than healed.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's grief-driven alchemy reads as embodied and specific, with contradictory impulses ("balanced alchemist" yet testing desperate measures) acting throughout. The final acceptance of being "held together" rather than healed shows earned endurance with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("luminous regret") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the kintsugi-repaired self accepting incompleteness - "I am not healed, but I am held together." The accumulative lens holds as metallurgical processes mirror emotional repair. Cost is visible in accepting permanent damage. Slight deduction for density that occasionally obscures immediate causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The foundry setting actively constrains choices (furnace heat, specific tools, rain collecting) and charges the final image of the "foundry [glowing] like a memory." Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered through alchemical expertise. The micro-setting of the repaired cup becomes essential to the closure's meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (processing guilt/grief through alchemical redemption) deepens through testing names' weight, repairing the vessel, and creating the alloy. The escalation from measurement to transformation shows agency. However, the mystical elements ("names attract their histories") arrive without sufficient grounding, slightly weakening the pressure's coherence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges brilliantly through the kintsugi metaphor - brokenness made beautiful through acknowledgment rather than erasure. The final image of being "held together" offers a non-literal answer to grief without moralizing. The "secret arithmetic" of names and measured remembrance creates genuine resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct alchemical voice with controlled technical diction ("assay cup," "alembics," "slag") that never breaks character. Perceptual signature focuses on weight, balance, and metallurgical properties consistently. Rhythm modulates effectively, though occasional abstraction ("luminous regret") slightly weakens immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm, but figurative density occasionally obscures ("ore turned to whisper," "ghost tonguing my every step"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("Names attract their histories, and histories drag like nets"). Information density is high but sometimes tips into overwriting that slows momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The kintsugi-as-grief-processing synthesis feels fresh and specific. The alchemical frame transforms familiar loss narrative through precise metallurgical detail. Risk-taking in the mystical realism ("factually mystical") mostly succeeds, though the name-weighing conceit stretches credibility slightly.</comment>
