<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "become the voice of the unknown, without presuming to own it" drives consistent choices through negotiation rather than command, with the elm leaf fossil serving as a concrete transitional object. The final choice to leave the fossil "resident not carried" demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "factually mystical work" that briefly lapses into label-speak rather than fully embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the narrator's partnership with the cave through the fossil exchange creates "trust earned by exchange." The orientation anchors (post-hibernation world, coastal caves, sensory mapping role) establish by ~100 words. The cost is visible in leaving the fossil as "resident not carried" and accepting the cave's terms rather than imposing human ownership.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cave environment actively constrains choices—the tide surge forces the narrator into the throat tunnel, the "curtain of mineral hair" must be navigated, and the black pool's rising/lowering dictates movement timing. Sensory details like "drops ring the pool with tiny collisions" and "wall warms under the fossil" create tactile immediacy. The cave functions as setting-character that must be negotiated with rather than commanded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—becoming the voice without owning—escalates through the storm surge that "tries to erase the plateau," forcing the narrator to protect and then deliberately place the fossil "in a deeper niche." This tightening transforms initial exploration into committed partnership with visible cost. The pressure coheres under the textural lens as emotional heat-mapping shifts from "spikes and falls" to "steady amber" marking earned trust.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete negotiation between human time, cave time, and forest time via the elm leaf fossil as "contract, an older signature than mine." The final image of stepping "toward the tunnels that lead outward" with the unknown "not captive, but partnered" offers a non-literal answer about voice and ownership. The piece resists easy moralizing about human-nature relationships through specific mystical-factual work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrator's perceptual signature—counting breaths, tracking thermal grammar, reading "pheromones of cave shrimp"—creates a distinct scientific-mystical voice. Some register drift occurs with phrases like "factually mystical" and "transitional objects" that occasionally lean academic without full integration. The controlled rhythm maintains consistency through the storm surge sequence, though brief moments of abstract philosophizing ("To become the voice of the unknown is to hold space") slightly dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "The caves accept agreements better than commands" and effective rhythm variation during the storm sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "I am tasked to shape one without lies" followed closely by "speak carefully for what cannot speak" restates similar content. Template cadence emerges in middle sections with repeated "I [verb]" constructions. The abstract register around "factually mystical work" and "transitional objects" creates occasional opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of a sensory map maker negotiating with caves through heat-mapped emotions after human hibernation offers genuine freshness. The specific synthesis of scientific measurement with mystical communication—"Colors lace along the walls, not visible to eyes, but visible to the map"—feels earned and non-obvious. The fossil as contract rather than decoration transforms a potential cliché into something specific and necessary.</comment>
