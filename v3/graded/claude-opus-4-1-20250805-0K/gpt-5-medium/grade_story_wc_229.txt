I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered sensory details, metaphorical resonance, and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to prove whispers' power over shouts drives consistent micro-choices (steeping petals, using the vial cork, refusing to shout). Internal contradiction emerges subtly between inherited duty and personal conviction. The transformation from apprentice to validated practitioner lands with earned cost—the mentor's acknowledgment comes only after demonstrated mastery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, the piece builds density through sensory layers and metaphorical patterns that culminate in the freighter's successful passage—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the captain's "quiet salute" validates the whisper method. Cost appears in the narrator's patient endurance against doubt. However, the orientation remains slightly diffuse early on, and the exact mechanics of how scent guides ships stays metaphorical rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint—the lighthouse's isolation demands alternative communication methods, while sensory details (salt, iron, gulls) create lived-in specificity. The vial cork operates as micro-setting that constrains breath and intention. The cobalt lighthouse, dawn timing, and post-heat-wave atmosphere all pressure the narrator's experimental approach to guidance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers' efficacy over shouts—intensifies through the freighter captain's precarious approach after his previous near-disaster. Escalation occurs through accumulation: from mopping salt to lighting the wick to steeping petals to the ship's successful passage. The mentor's arrival adds pressure that crystallizes in his wordless acknowledgment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the whisper/shout dichotomy, exploring how gentleness achieves what force cannot. The vial cork's ability to "purify intentions" becomes literal through practiced breath control. The final image of the narrator whispering their name "until it knows me back" offers a non-literal answer about reciprocal communication with the natural world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice emerges through unexpected metaphors ("distance listens deeper than brass," "each drop is a small ear"). The lyrical register remains consistent while modulating with emotional intensity. Perceptual signature shows in how the narrator notices molecular-level responses and treats objects as animate listeners.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but occasional abstraction dulls immediacy ("gratitude needs a crossing guard"). Some metaphorical density in peak moments risks opacity ("two notes on a staff, and the shore begins to score itself"). Template cadence appears briefly in mid-section ("I light... I keep... I learned...").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of whispers as navigation method offers fresh inflection on maritime guidance. Specific synthesis of beekeeping methods with lighthouse keeping creates non-obvious connections. The grandmother's vial cork as breath-steadying talisman transforms a simple object into complex practice.</comment>
