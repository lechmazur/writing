<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's contradictory impulses between claustrophobia and hunger for expansive silence act simultaneously throughout, with the final choice to "sprout openings" earning genuine transformation through accumulated particulars. The father's arc from concrete-safety to understanding "home" as mapped hush shows earned change with visible cost in how blueprints soften.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently as the narrator collects silences that culminate in sharing gilded hush with the father, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where both characters' understanding of safety transforms with felt cost ("fear cannot corner the ones who enter"). The monthly gravity inversion provides coherent world-logic that enables the journey without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The xenial trellis with "rooms with no corners" and "alcoves [that] keep different tastings of quiet" creates a specific anti-bunker space that directly constrains the narrator's collection method. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (silences taste like "citrus and an ache," "binder's glue and patience") though some descriptions edge toward overwrought.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding a silence the father could understand—escalates through accumulation of different silence types until the gilded hush creates genuine risk ("Too much gilded hush and I stop wanting doors at all"). The cost is legible when sharing requires "limiting exposure, careful for both our sakes," forcing measured vulnerability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete particulars of different silences, never stating but showing how safety can be expansive rather than restrictive. The final image of "sprouting openings here" offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire bunker-builder premise without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout ("walls make my pulse burr like a trapped moth"), with controlled lyric compression that teaches its pattern early and maintains consistency. The POV's selective attention to silence types and spatial qualities creates a coherent voice-world, though occasional phrases like "intangibly tangible" strain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, but several instances of overwrought figurative language ("gilded hush blown through its beams like pollen") and abstract constructions ("something intangibly tangible") create opacity. The prose maintains momentum despite these friction points, with strong rhythm variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of monthly gravity inversion enabling access to a silence-tasting trellis is genuinely fresh, executed with full commitment to its implications. The synthesis of bunker-builder's child seeking expansive quiet feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightening rather than obscuring stakes.</comment>
