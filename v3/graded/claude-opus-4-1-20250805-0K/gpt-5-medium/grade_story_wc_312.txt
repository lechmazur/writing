<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Efan's earnest naivety drives the central action effectively - his patient counting and belief in "plausible impossibility" enables the cosmic repair where brittle wisdom failed. The fisherman provides minimal but effective pressure through his resigned acceptance. Minor deduction for the fisherman's limited dimensionality beyond thematic function.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through dripping rates that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Efan's mathematical ceremony partially restores cosmic balance. The "silver ripple returned" provides visible cost acknowledgment - only an echo restored, not the original. Causality holds through accumulated observations leading to the ceremonial adjustment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The viaduct, dripping water, and broken bell function as active constraints shaping Efan's method - he must work before dawn's disruption, using the bell's crack to guide drops. Vivid sensory work: "sea made a sound like breathing through damp cloth," "salt scar," physical details accumulate into atmosphere that charges the final restoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating pressure - from city's desperation after "last fish is caught" through Efan's patient observation to the ceremonial realignment. The ticking dawn deadline adds urgency. Cost is visible but modest: only partial restoration achieved, "rebuilt an echo, not the original."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the contrast between brittle devotion and lukewarm flexibility, with the final "silver ripple" offering a non-literal answer about accepting imperfect repair over rigid perfection. The bell's transformation from groaning failure to "coordination, gentle as flint dust" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "fish moved like prayers between notes," "nights into nets." POV maintains consistent distance with selective perception focused on water's mathematics. Dialogue between Efan and fisherman carries effective subtext about acceptance versus action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong syntactic variety and information density, though occasional ornamental phrases like "unhurried lantern lit from within" edge toward overwriting without disrupting clarity. Excellent propulsion through varied paragraph lengths and sentence structures that mirror the dripping rhythm being observed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic/mathematical precision with maritime imagery creates memorable specificity. The concept of fixing stellar damage through water droplet timing is genuinely inventive. The lukewarm mage as solution to brittle wisdom transforms the typical chosen-one trope effectively.</comment>
