I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through lyric imagery and metaphorical layers rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Miren's motivation as memory-keeper is embodied through concrete actions (pruning scars, teaching the child), and her internal need to preserve wonder drives specific choices. The child provides immediate relational pressure that forces Miren to demonstrate rather than contemplate. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("insatiably creative") that briefly tells rather than embodies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural structure coheres through pattern-taught metaphor (pruning as memory-keeping) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the seed's planting crystallizes the "weaving between worlds" concept with felt cost—the child's promise and changed perception. The orientation anchors (waterfall parapet, orchard, valley) establish by ~100 words. Closure lands with the child tasting future transformation, though the conceptual cost could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The waterfall parapet functions as more than backdrop—its seam between flagstones becomes the literal planting site where "worlds already greet each other." Sensory details (sap scent "like bread learning to rise," mist beading) are filtered through Miren's professional perception. The orchard itself constrains choices as Miren must work within its seasonal wounds and accumulated silences.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through layered metaphorical stakes: tired apples, the child's cracked jar holding loneliness, branches "heavy with silence." The child's arrival creates the decisive deepening that forces Miren from contemplation to action. Cost appears in the released scent and the child's transformed face, though escalation remains gentle rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of pruning as memory-keeping, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the child tasting "morning peeking out" offers a non-literal answer to preserving wonder through careful tending. The seed as repository of testimony rather than soil elegantly reframes expectation without stating meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled metaphorical density ("threshing floor for dreams," "waterfall's patience"). The child's simple dialogue ("our apples taste tired") provides effective contrast to Miren's elevated perception. Perceptual signature strong in how Miren experiences the orchard through professional senses—hearing sap, feeling creative impulses from mist.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the cut released a scent like bread learning to rise") but suffers from occasional abstract scaffolding ("radiant hush" appears three times, "capturing essence" twice). Some metaphors strain ("afterglow pooled between the lines"). Information density generally high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, though a few loop near-synonyms ("wise orchard pruner the valley trusted").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The conceit of pruning exhaustion from stories and feeding testimony to seeds offers fresh transformation of pastoral tropes. The specific synthesis of memory-keeping through orchard work feels earned, though some elements (the seed's hunger for testimony rather than soil) push toward precious rather than profound. Risk-taking in the lyric mode pays off more than it falters.</comment>
