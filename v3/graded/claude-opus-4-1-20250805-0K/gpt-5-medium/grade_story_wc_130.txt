I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and metaphorical mathematics rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The conjurer's motivation crystallizes through embodied grief—his sister's disappearance calcified into "ambiguous loss rather than clean grief." His internal contradiction between wanting "not reunion, but coherence" drives authentic choices. The mathematics metaphor provides consistent character-specific perception, though some interiority edges toward abstract philosophy rather than embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the theorem "love equals attention multiplied by time, divided by the courage to admit uncertainty." The cost is legible in accepting unsolvable equations—"a theorem he cannot solve but can carry." However, the accumulative pattern relies heavily on metaphorical abstraction, and the physical actions with the glass eyes feel ornamental rather than essential to the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cavern orchard with stalactites creates a liminal space where mineral and organic merge—"trunks beset by mineral blossoms and its fruit glistening like cooled tears." Setting constrains through its hidden nature and shapes the protagonist's secretive ritual. The dripping stalactites marking time and the moon threading through fissures actively participate in the divination.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes center on transforming grief into "coherence"—finding a way to "dovetail her absence with his days." The mathematical framework provides accumulative pressure as equations build toward acceptance. However, the conflict remains largely internal without significant tightening or external pressure, and the resolution arrives through contemplation rather than tested choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mathematics-of-emotion conceit, avoiding direct moralizing. The final theorem reweights all prior mathematical imagery into a lived philosophy of loss. Particularly strong is how "longing is not an error term but a variable, stubborn and elegant"—theme embodied in metaphor without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical density with distinctive perceptual signature—seeing emotions as mathematics, grief as geometry. Syntax modulates effectively between longer contemplative sentences and shorter revelatory moments. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("calcified into ambiguous loss") that slightly exceeds the character's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty—"fruit glistening like cooled tears," "moon has lowered a rope of light." However, abstract philosophical passages create momentum drag ("he wonders if emotion can be graphed in the orchard, if sorrow approaches a limit"). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats without clear payoff, though the mathematical conceit provides pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mathematics-of-emotion framework offers genuine freshness, transforming grief narrative through geometric and algebraic metaphor. The cavern orchard setting—neither fully natural nor artificial—creates original atmosphere. The sister's backstory with "fractions using buttons and sunlight" provides specific lived detail that grounds abstraction.</comment>
