I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation crystalizes through the geode's physical presence and its role as both wound and compass, with contradictory impulses (hunting force while nursing grief) acting simultaneously. The final stance of keeping "the measure open and unclean" represents earned endurance with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("bleak exhilaration is honest") that briefly undermines embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the geode's evolving significance and the narrator's perturbation methodology, culminating in a Charged Poise where unused potential literally lifts the observatory. The cost is legible in "the hush that must be kept for the pooling to continue" and the narrator's vow to remain perpetually awakened. Orientation anchors (floating observatory, night physicist role) arrive clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The geode crystal functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—held to glass, creating "cathedral ruins" of light that teach "how to harvest the slack." The observatory's position above the wedding convoy road creates spatial pressure that charges the final hovering image. Setting actively shapes the narrator's methodology through circuit breakers and cooling systems.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—harvesting unused potential while managing grief—deepens through the perturbation sequence that reveals the basin and makes machines "slow their circle." Cost manifests in maintaining perpetual vigilance ("to keep the measure open and unclean"). The escalation from observation to active perturbation to commitment represents meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the geode as "oracle that survived out of spite" and the concept of unused potential pooling in unacknowledged spaces. The final image of being lifted by unused might while maintaining an "unfiltered awakening" offers a non-literal answer about transformation through sustained witness. No explicit moralizing; the complexity of harvesting force from tragedy remains unresolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through technical-poetic fusion ("derivative hums in the rafters," "perturbation theory like a lantern"). Voice maintains consistency through scientific precision merged with embodied trauma. Some register elevation in metaphorical passages ("purple cathedral under skin") fits the narrator's transformed perspective post-blast.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("bleak exhilaration is honest," "intangibly tangible") and mild redundancy in the pooling concept across multiple paragraphs. The prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("I knock the panel with my knuckles, and the geode crystal answers") but occasional opacity in metaphorical stretches reduces momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of drone strike survivor using perturbation theory to harvest unused potential from tragedy sites is non-obvious and feels inevitable given the setup. The geode as both shrapnel and oracle represents fresh transformation of trauma narrative. Risk-taking in the lyric-scientific hybrid voice heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity at closure.</comment>
