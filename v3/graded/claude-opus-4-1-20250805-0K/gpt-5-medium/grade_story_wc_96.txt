I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as it builds through lyric density and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's monthly personality molting creates genuine internal tension, particularly in "I watch my current personality glow and crack, and I press my palm to my chest to keep the fragments friendly." The friendship with Lio grounds motivation through concrete shared history. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("stupid and holy") that briefly distances from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pressure builds through image density ("pennies inked with phrases," "poems flutter") toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "Beauty is not a treaty here...but a practice." Cost registers through the impending personality molt threatening this connection. Orientation anchors clearly by line 4, though the exact nature of the library reconstruction could be clearer earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rusted library with "stacks are ribs, and books breathe like sleeping beasts" functions as living setting that shapes action. The fence as "harp missing strings" that "wind plays anyway" creates atmospheric pressure. The coffee tin's false bottom and map of pennies constrain and enable choices throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from sorting memories to stringing poem-lines to rebuilding the door "from a refrigerator panel and a belt." The pressure coheres around preserving this sanctuary before the next molting. Cost manifests in "If I molt tomorrow, let the next self remember this night by the ghost of copper on the fingers."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between permanence and change, crystallizing in "Beauty is not a treaty here...but a practice." The pennies as "small currency burning holes in nothing" and the map showing houses "where a book was seized or a song fined" create resonant specificity without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "This body molts personalities monthly, shedding faces like ticket stubs." The lyric compression serves the piece's aims, with controlled rhythm modulating under pressure. Dialogue sparse but effective: "Tonight we teach the wind to carry syllables farther."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "We string twine between shelves and fence, clip poems to it with clothespins, and the lines lift like prayer flags." Minor metaphor density in places ("stupid and holy," "luminous fracture") but generally controlled. No loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of personality molting while maintaining revolutionary continuity through objects and maps offers fresh specificity. The pennies engraved with verbs as "small currency" and the false-bottom tin containing addresses on flattened pennies create original texture. Some familiar beats (outlaw library) but transformed through specific detail.</comment>
