<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio's motivation to understand echoes drives consistent choices through questioning the nexus and testing patterns. The final realization about debt/connection creating echoes while rope-cutters vanish shows earned understanding through concrete discovery. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("where ribs meet and carry a small river of feeling") that doesn't fully embody the emotional state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with progressive disclosure of voices building to the insight that echoes come from entanglement. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when Lio understands why some echo (bound by debts/promises) while others vanish (cut ropes), with visible cost in accepting to be a "knot-maker." The mother's forgiven debts and Lio's promise create felt emotional weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus where "rivers knot and uncoil" provides atmospheric pressure, and the whispering seashell functions as a tool that enables discovery. Setting details like "reeds brush together like pages" support the thematic exploration. However, the canyon/water setting could constrain choices more directly rather than serving primarily as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through progressive questioning ("Who keeps you," "Who summons you," "Who refuses you") with each answer deepening understanding. The dominant stake—learning why some echo—tightens when Lio discovers their own web of connections and must choose whether to be "rope-cutter or knot-maker." Cost becomes visible when accepting the binding nature of promises.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the echo/debt metaphor without explicit moralizing. The final insight that "promises make echoes stoop to drink" and Lio's vow to tie "kindness to clarity" offers a non-literal answer about human connection. The mother's pot songs steaming into food creates resonant specificity that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("I am the canyon echo singer who walks between cliffs"). Perceptual signature shows in unique phrasings like "sand-syllables" and "silence full of teeth." The prose maintains consistency through emotional peaks, and the pattern of questioning creates structural coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong figurative language ("silver rope," "crown of silt," "moonlit carp") serves the accumulative design without overwriting. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("small river of feeling") and slight register elevation that doesn't always match the intimate POV.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo/debt/connection metaphor creates an original exploration of human bonds. The specific detail of mother's pot songs and the serpentine nexus as repository of echoes avoids generic treatment. The conceptual framework of rope-cutters versus knot-makers offers memorable perspective on attachment.</comment>
