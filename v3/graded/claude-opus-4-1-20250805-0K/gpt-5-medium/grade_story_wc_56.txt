<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to expose the city's lies drives consistent choices, with internal contradiction between wanting "serene upheaval" and the weight of family complicity creating genuine tension. The final collaboration with the engineer shows earned change through discovered evidence. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("architecture of lies") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the narrator and engineer push off together to map "a truer city," foreclosing the path of ignorance with visible cost (family betrayal revealed). The box discovery and document revelation create meaningful tightening that reweights all prior refusals. Orientation anchored effectively by canal, lock, dawn timing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The canal setting constrains choices through water navigation, lock stairs, and hidden box location. Sensory details like "slime-green seal" and "weak blue of dawn" are selective and purposeful. The sundial's warmth and compass needle's twitch add tactile specificity that matters to the search.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through physical search, box discovery, document revelation, and family complicity realization—each narrowing the narrator's options. The cost is legible in accepting family betrayal and choosing exposure over comfort. The engineer confrontation forces stance crystallization with clear trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the discovery that floods were engineered to "wash deeds and dates into softer shapes"—a concrete metaphor for historical erasure. The final image of "ripples like new lines on a map" resonantly answers the central question about truth versus comfortable lies without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "twilight stretched thin along the water, a parchment ribbon" and controlled rhythm throughout. Some elevated diction ("serene upheaval") occasionally strains the working-class canal navigator voice but mostly maintains consistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some abstract phrases ("architecture of lies," "hindsight clarity") appear multiple times without added pressure. Strong opening and closing lines. Minor template cadence in middle section ("I had come to salvage... I needed them to understand...").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of engineered floods erasing history offers a fresh angle on corruption narratives. The specific detail of the "silence of morning radio" creating operational windows shows originality. However, the whistleblower-finds-evidence plot structure itself is familiar territory.</comment>
