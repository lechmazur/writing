I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through lyric density and pattern intensification rather than strict causality, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the queen merges with her stone self.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The queen's motivation to pursue recurring dreams manifests through concrete embodied details ("braids combed by wind," "crescent drawn on brow") and her contradictory impulses play out in scene—rejecting the crown while seeking answers. The final merger with her stone self lands as earned renunciation with visible cost ("dreams not dismissed but worn like a ring"). Minor deduction for the wanderer's somewhat static role as guide rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the queen merges with her stone self, accepting dreams as part of identity rather than mystery to solve. The accumulative structure coheres through recurring images (bleeding starlight, moths/flames, threads) that reweight at the ending. Cost is legible in the choice between throne and self-knowledge ("I cannot serve it as a ghost of unasked questions").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory work throughout ("wind combed her braids," "flask the color of nicked bone," "voice of a wet veil whisked across tile") with setting constraining choices—the mountain path narrows options, the grotto reveals the stone self. The cobalt grotto and bleeding starlight pool effectively pressure the final choice, though some descriptions edge toward ornamental ("orchards," "ember grotto").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: crown abandoned → path narrowing → pool of bleeding starlight → confronting stone self. The wanderer's warning ("you will choose who rules when you go back, and who you will not be able to forgive") crystallizes the cost. Pressure coheres under the textural lens through pattern intensification rather than reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The moth/flame metaphor elegantly encapsulates the theme of destructive attraction to power, paid off when the wanderer reveals "you would not look at the moth, only the flame." The ending reweights earlier images without stating a moral—dreams transform from mystery to integrated identity. The recurring motifs (threads, bleeding, braiding) constrain choices and charge the final merger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric register ("crown cooling on a dish of salt," "mountains whose ribs cut the dusk"). Dialogue carries subtext effectively—the wanderer's "You are late" and queen's "I am precisely when I can be" establish their dynamic without exposition. Minor compression in peak moments but voice texture remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of ornamental density ("lacy menace of power and mercy knotted together") and some filter-verb clustering ("she felt," "she saw," "she wondered") in middle sections. The paraphrase loop about dreams returning appears twice. Final paragraph achieves clean propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quest narrative with internal integration—the journey leads not to external treasure but to accepting rejected aspects of self. The stone-self-as-destination and dreams-as-threads-through-body show imaginative specificity. The wanderer as cradle/coronation witness adds mythic resonance without feeling derivative.</comment>
