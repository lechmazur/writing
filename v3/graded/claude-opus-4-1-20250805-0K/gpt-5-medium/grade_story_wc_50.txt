<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The locksmith's motivation to "store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" drives consistent, specific actions through the cavern work, with his peripheral focus and patient methodology revealing character under the constraint of his broken timer. His choice to leave the timer behind "because some keys should stay where they learn" shows meaningful renunciation with visible cost, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("agreements between patience and pressure").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens builds through mapping light angles, machining gears, and harvesting echoes until the Resonant Reconfiguration lands when he stocks jars "for some late year" when courage is needed—a Charged Poise that crystallizes his purpose with felt cost in leaving the timer. The piece teaches its pattern early through the methodical accumulation of technical details that reweight into emotional preservation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cavern functions as active constraint—its acoustic properties, light angles at different times, and specific hollows directly shape his harvesting method and force adaptations like placing brass prisms and finding the sweet spot "behind a veined column." Sensory hierarchy reflects his craft perfectly: he notices "sidelong glints," echo returns, and the timer's "wrongness" through sound, making environment inseparable from purpose.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each technical challenge (mapping angles, repairing gears, calibrating to bat rhythms) deepens his investment until the successful harvest validates his method, with visible cost in leaving the timer behind. The dominant stake—preserving wonder mechanically—faces consistent obstacles that narrow his options, though the pressure could tighten more dramatically in the middle third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete synthesis of mechanical precision and emotional preservation, never stated but embodied in "locks were never only doors; they were agreements." The final image of jars that will "pour out, not like a miracle, but like a mechanism remembered" offers a resonant answer about how technical craft can safeguard human wonder without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through "peripherally focused" attention and technical vocabulary ("tumblers under tension," "mainspring," "nested bell") creates a coherent craftsman's consciousness. The controlled rhythm accelerates during technical work and slows for reflection, though occasional abstractions ("harvest of echoes promised by maps") slightly blur the otherwise precise voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Floods had bruised the orchards" establishes both setting and season economically. Some metaphorical density in early passages ("marble cavern exhaled a hush like cooled iron") and occasional abstract phrasing ("cellar of reason") create minor friction, but the technical precision and varied syntax maintain strong momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmithing with echo-harvesting creates an original premise executed through specific technical details (timer mechanism repair, acoustic mapping) rather than generic wonder. The choice to preserve ephemeral sound through mechanical means, treating wonder as something that can be "rationed like grain in a lean year," offers a fresh angle on memory and preservation.</comment>
