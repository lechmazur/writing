<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to map echo-memories drives consistent micro-choices (hopscotch squares, reading the letter aloud, binding the negative). Internal conflict between documenting faithfully versus "pretty symbols" creates genuine tension. The final acceptance of "legacy's burden" as a warming shawl shows earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through discovered artifacts (diaries, negative, letter) that reweight the protagonist's role from observer to inheritor. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when accepting the burden transforms mapping from career to citizenship. Cost is legible in "my name slid away like a coin down a tide drain" and the weight of the promise settling on shoulders.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drowned district setting constrains every choice through water damage, sideways-sliding architecture, and tide schedules. Sensory detail ("salt grammar," "soot," "kelp") filters through the cartographer's acoustic expertise. The house on stilts of memory charging the final image makes environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating discoveries that deepen the protagonist's obligation from professional documentation to personal inheritance. The hopscotch sequence literalizes increasing stakes as each square reveals emotional geography. Cost manifests in accepting a vow "calcified into the grain" that forecloses pure observation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and loss, with walls holding memory that water threatens to erase. The film negative as "lens to invert brightness" offers non-literal wisdom about attending to absences. The final vision of ruins as "a school for hearing" reweights the entire piece without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through acoustic sensitivity ("corridor hummed like a shell," "faint taps"). Voice maintains lyric control even under pressure, with syntax mimicking the echo-mapping work through recursive, layered sentences. No head-hopping, consistent POV modesty about what walls actually dream.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("ivy tapped the window with small weather reports"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("shawl woven from echoes") but pattern-taught and pays off. Minor scaffold in "I thought of the mentors again" but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The echo cartographer concept freshly synthesizes climate fiction with memory preservation through acoustic mapping. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure and the hopscotch divination sequence heightens stakes. The transformation of professional duty into inherited obligation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
