<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's transformation from "quiet clerk" to active rebel is earned through concrete memories of her mother and the museum's erasure, with visible cost in her choice to risk exposure. The internal contradiction between her careful public persona and nighttime mission creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("tyranny of indifference") that could be more embodied, though the final image of her "reappearing in herself" lands with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural structure builds through puddle reflections, lagoon ripples, and moth swarms toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara becomes "the hinge" between erased voices and the museum's false histories. The cost is legible in lines like "the world keeps the shape of what it resists" and her acceptance of anonymity. Minor orientation wobble with the temporal jump from "that afternoon" to "now" around line 11, but the closure lands powerfully with her coded freedom.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The auric lagoon functions as more than setting—it's the active medium through which Mara channels the erased voices, with water that "remembers gold" and writes back in ripples. Sensory details like "penny metal and rain on paper" and the moths as "soft bodies" create vivid specificity. The maintenance box as "singing hinge" constrains her choice and enables the final transformation, though some middle passages could sharpen spatial choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from discovering the caption's lie, to finding the key, following puddle reflections, opening the maintenance box, and finally accepting her role as "the hinge." The dominant stake—restoring erased voices—tightens as she risks exposure ("police siren wheeled and stalled"). Cost is visible in her choosing anonymity over recognition, though the middle section could benefit from one more concrete obstacle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the water's memory, the "grammar of coded freedom," and moths spelling "stubborn grammar of people who refuse to vanish." The final image of Mara as both "true" and "coded" crystallizes the theme without stating it. The mother's voice—"the world keeps the shape of what it resists"—provides earned wisdom from concrete struggle rather than platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice weaves lyrical compression ("folding risk into routine like a note into worn denim") with technical precision ("circuits," "staves," "maintenance box"). The perceptual signature shows Mara reading the city as code—puddles become maps, power lines become musical staves. Minor inconsistency in register when shifting between poetic and procedural modes, but the voice coheres at closure with "true, but also coded."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong figurative density serves the accumulative design—"auric lagoon," "tiny hearts restarting after winter," moths as "storm of soft bodies." Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("tyranny of indifference" appears twice) and some filter constructions ("she imagined," "she thought of") that slightly dull immediacy in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of technological resistance through defunct phone company infrastructure with mystical water memory creates a fresh angle on the "rebel against revisionist history" premise. The specific detail of using old telephone circuits to carry erased voices through museum displays transforms familiar elements. Risk-taking in the lyrical-technical hybrid voice and the choice to end with coded anonymity rather than triumph heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
