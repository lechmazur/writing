<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's empirically whimsical methodology creates a distinct voice with concrete contradictions (rigorous fairy tale, cataloging waves while asking crabs for sources). The partnership with Iru and the choice to plant the seed despite luminous doubt shows earned agency with visible cost—the island's willingness to wait depends on their "faithful accounting."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the planted seed transforms into a tree that sorts myth from memory, with the island awakening itself. Cost is legible: the narrator must abandon their role as sole reality checker, accepting shared stewardship. The orientation anchors (fantasy island, ridge, reality checker role) establish cleanly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ridge functions as active setting—flowers speak in scent, stones flex "like old knuckles," and the hollow shaped like a sleeping ear becomes the planting site. The monsoon's approach creates temporal pressure that shapes the final act. However, some descriptive passages (hibiscus as archivists) lean ornamental without constraining specific choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from cataloging myths to protecting the seed to finding the right soil through dreams. The monsoon's patient waiting creates genuine pressure—"The island would let us finish if we kept our accounting faithful." The cost manifests as role transformation, though the middle section's dream sequences could tighten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between empirical verification and luminous doubt, crystallizing in "doubt glowed like a lighthouse." The final image of the ridge blooming "in vowels that will not wash away" resonantly answers whether stories fear drowning or erasure—they fear both, but faithful accounting preserves them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice balances whimsy with precision ("petals debate like cautious jurors," "every footprint becomes a rumor"). The POV maintains consistent perceptual signature—treating abstract concepts as tangible (recording dreams on wet pages, testing them against sunrise). Minor register elevation in places ("empirically whimsical") fits the narrator's self-aware stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong imagery density and propulsion, though some metaphorical clusters approach overwriting ("bruise of approaching rain," "metronome of recollection"). The prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful compression. Occasional abstraction ("memory broke when people mistook whispers for lineage") could ground more concretely.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of a reality checker for myths who uses "empirically whimsical" methods offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of magical realism with scientific methodology creates non-obvious tension. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure and the ambiguous narrator role (human? spirit?) heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
