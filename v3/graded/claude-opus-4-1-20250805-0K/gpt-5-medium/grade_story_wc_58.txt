I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through layered imagery and metaphorical density rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's peculiar vocation and method are grounded in consistent, specific actions (unwinding thread, projecting presence). The woman's grief over "latitude" rather than death creates genuine emotional complexity. Internal contradiction manifests when the narrator bridges absence while acknowledging their own "walled and windowed" motivation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration when the thread transforms the woman's navigation of her house into "a pilgrim trail under the roof," with visible cost in her weeping that becomes "irrigating." The accumulative structure coheres around the central metaphor of explained absences. However, the projection sequence could be more viscerally grounded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "shadowed garden" with bruising quince trees functions as more than backdrop—it mirrors and enables the work of grief. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("leaves like small coins spending their shine"). The palace thread constrains method and charges the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from the woman's need to "sit at the table without drawing a second cup" through the narrator's projection into absence, culminating in the thread's transformation into a navigation tool. The cost is visible in her "irrigating" tears and the husband's "hands raw from hauling hope."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of "explained absences" without stating morals. The final image of the garden "spangled with the stubborn brilliance of leaving things" resonantly reweights all prior departures. Subtext operates throughout, particularly in "latitude is crueler because it changes nothing around me."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled metaphorical density ("the harbor learns to listen to the empty piers like a conch pressed to its own bones"). Perceptual signature is distinct—this narrator notices absence as presence. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Some metaphorical density borders on overwriting ("wavering light" that "remakes" the woman) but serves the accumulative mode. Minor template cadence in "She says...She gives me...She weeps" sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of writing "obituaries for the living" offers genuine freshness, transforming grief literature through specific craft (the palace thread, projection method). The paradox of presence through absence and "latitude" as a form of death shows conceptual integrity. Risk-taking in the lyrical density heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
