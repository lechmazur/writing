<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's relationship with death creates a compelling lens through which all observations flow, with concrete embodiment in "Death and I were on a first name basis, so the pressure felt like conversation rather than peril." The internal conflict between professional duty and personal haunting manifests through micro-choices like taking the snow globe, though the emotional arc could deepen further through more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered maritime disasters toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator's ascent with the snow globe crystallizes the physics of letting go—"some artifacts need a second chance at weather." The cost is legible in "I had time for air and sorrow," though the conceptual weight could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sunken library setting functions as more than backdrop, with specific details like "silted chairs and a phone patch logbook swelled like a drowned lung" constraining the narrator's movements and choices. The snow globe's crack "where salt had started to learn the alphabet of ruin" exemplifies how setting infiltrates objects to charge meaning, though some spatial choreography between rooms could be clearer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the physics of letting go through maritime disasters—deepens through accumulation from Earhart to the freighter captain's last transmission, with the narrator's decision to take the snow globe representing a meaningful if quiet turn. The pressure coheres under the textural lens but could benefit from one more moment where the narrator's professional distance genuinely threatens to break.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the accumulation of failed transmissions and the physics metaphor, culminating in the snow globe as "a second chance at weather" that reweights all prior material without stating a moral. The parallels between Earhart's voice, the freighter captain's plea, and the narrator's own transmission create resonant layers of meaning about communication across the void.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice maintains exceptional control with lines like "Death and I were on a first name basis" and "the sea refused to stop giving me voices," creating a distinct perceptual signature of someone who catalogues disaster with clinical precision while fighting emotional undertow. The rhythm modulates perfectly with pressure, though one moment of syntactic compression under peak stress could heighten the effect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "I copied them onto my slate and noted how my hand wanted to round every letter as if smoothing a child's hair in a storm." Minor template cadence appears in the repeated "I [verb]" constructions mid-story, preventing higher scoring, but the closing sequence is flawless.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of Earhart's discovery with a sunken library ship creates an unexpected angle on maritime tragedy, while the physics metaphor for grief offers conceptual freshness. The specific detail of the snow globe collection and the keeper's marginalia elevate beyond template underwater exploration, though the emotional territory of loss remains somewhat familiar.</comment>
