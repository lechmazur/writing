I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to teach dust to tell stories after the "story famine" is consistent and embodied through concrete actions like copying cadences onto onionskin and scattering ash to form letters. The internal contradiction between preserving old scores and learning new notation creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional beats ("grief and timber") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where dust becomes fluent in storytelling, with visible cost paid through the narrator's promise to "leave a score wherever ash settled." The accumulative lens holds as density increases through layered images of dust, ash, and notation. The piece teaches its pattern early (dust as language medium) and pays it off when "dust kept telling, now fluent, now shy, but always breathing measure."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ember alcove setting constrains choices excellently—the burned rooms provide ash for writing, the shortwave radio's glow must be hidden, and the physical space shapes how dust accumulates into stories. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "Needle-snow fell from the rafters," "the radio hissed like a teapot." The micro-setting of ash and dust functions as both constraint and resource for the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching dust to tell stories again—escalates through accumulation as the narrator progresses from copying silence to receiving the pirate broadcast to actively shaping ash into letters. The cost manifests when accepting the broadcast's terms requires perpetual service: "a promise to carry tempo forward." One meaningful deepening occurs when Cinder appears and the dust becomes "fluent."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of dust/ash as language, avoiding abstraction. The final image of the narrator keeping time "because stories deserve a conductor who listens first" offers a resonant answer about art's persistence through destruction. The recurring motif of musical notation as story-grammar constrains choices and charges the closure without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with musical/archival vocabulary ("numbered rests and tied slurs," "barlines as narrow as spider threads") that remains consistent under pressure. The perceptual signature focuses on temperature, texture, and sound in character-specific ways. Minor compression occurs appropriately during the broadcast sequence. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Night fell with thistled calm, soft but barbed" establishes time, atmosphere, and tension simultaneously. Some elevated diction ("thistled calm," "elusive song lyrics") serves the lyric mode effectively. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("between grief and timber") and slight redundancy in dust/ash descriptions mid-story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of music copyist work with dust-as-language after catastrophe feels fresh and inevitable. The pirate broadcast that "scored the fog" transforms radio communication tropes through specific musical notation metaphors. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes while maintaining clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreating to conventional narrative.</comment>
