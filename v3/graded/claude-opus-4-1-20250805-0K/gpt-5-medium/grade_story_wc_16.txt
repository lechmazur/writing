<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal conflict between cautious discipline and reckless hope drives authentic choices, particularly in composing promises despite uncertainty. The cost of vulnerability lands clearly when offering the quill and revising together. Minor deduction for some abstraction around "carefully reckless" that could be more embodied, but the final reconciliation earns its emotional weight through specific accumulated details.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration through the composed promises leading to reconciliation. The closure lands with visible cost—three winters of silence resolved through vulnerable collaboration. The orientation anchors clearly (archive, dawn, linguist) and causality holds as each promise movement builds toward Lio's return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archive functions as more than backdrop—its shelves have "throats," the room becomes an instrument, and spatial details (shadow behind stairs, high windows) enable key moments. Sensory work is selective and purposeful ("dust motes like annotations"). The setting constrains and enables the reconciliation, though some descriptions lean abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes signal early (restoring trust after silence) and escalate through the three promise movements to Lio's emergence. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through composed promises rather than confrontation. Cost is legible in the vulnerability required and the revision of promises together, though the reconciliation arrives somewhat smoothly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the central metaphor of language/music as trust-building. The ending offers a non-literal answer about choreographed vulnerability without moralizing. "Trust is not a monument but a choreography" crystallizes the theme through earned specificity. The symphonies of truth concept meaningfully shapes both form and resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("dust motes hung like annotations"). The perceptual signature is consistent—a linguist who hears structure in silence. Some elevated diction ("cautious exuberance," "fugueing heart") fits the academic POV. Dialogue feels natural when it appears, carrying subtext about fear and reconciliation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm, though some abstraction ("carefully reckless" appears multiple times) and occasional overwriting ("heart fugueing"). Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple purposes. Some metaphorical density in places but largely serves the linguistic theme. Deduction for repetitive "carefully reckless" and some elevated register moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of linguistics, music, and trust-building creates an original emotional landscape. The archive as instrument and promises as musical movements show genuine ingenuity. The specific detail about the stele that sang names and the Breviary of Maz avoid generic academic settings. Risk-taking in the lyrical approach heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
