I'll evaluate this story systematically according to the rubric.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through layered imagery and pattern breaks, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Mira awakens and the entangled memories are accepted rather than untangled.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to reconnect with Mira through forbidden drumming is clear and embodied ("my ribs hollowed like flutes"). Internal contradictions act in scene as they balance compliance with rebellion. The final acceptance of donor memories ("I promised them I would tap out their names") shows earned change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira awakens carrying both their memories and the donors' fragments, accepting rather than untangling them. The cost is explicit: "We would not return to before." The accumulative lens holds as drumming patterns build to breach the treatment's boundaries.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden functions as both setting and instrument, constraining choices ("sensors watched me like constellations"). The auric lagoon becomes tangible through "gold dust" and "ripples." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from rails to lagoon to ward, with environment actively shaping the escape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal rebellion to shared awakening as drumming opens the sound bridge. The dominant stake (reconnecting with Mira despite treatment) tightens when donor memories intrude ("scenes erupted that belonged to neither of us"). Cost manifests in accepting foreign memories as the price of connection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of entanglement as love versus medical pathology. The final image of "learning its music" offers a non-literal answer about accepting complexity rather than untangling it. Subtext operates throughout, especially in "Security arrived late... I gave them my wrists like roses."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout ("the hush of the universe inhaling," "stars lean closer, their light tasting of unread letters"). Voice maintains lyric consistency under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate, but internal voice sustains metaphoric density without becoming opaque.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The garden heard intentions the way a seashell hears the ocean"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("auroral sorrow, that color of becoming that hurts because it is true") borders on overwriting but maintains coherence. Minor template cadence in "I + verb" constructions mid-story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of medical SF with lyric interiority creates an original treatment of memory-sharing. The sound garden as both instrument and bridge shows ingenuity. Risk-taking in the dense metaphoric approach heightens stakes while maintaining clarity at closure.</comment>
