<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's patient, methodical approach to mediation shows consistent characterization, with internal complexity evident in "I wanted to map empathy onto action" versus the community's demand for a verdict. The final choice to stay and oversee implementation demonstrates earned agency with visible cost ("I would live here a season"). Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("shadows lace me tighter") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the narrator's mediation that transforms conflict into collaborative action, with clear cost in the commitment to stay. The accumulative/textural lens holds as the piece builds through layered images (mirrors, fragments, ice) toward the final insight that "practice, finally, is how peace keeps." The orientation anchors early with lighthouse orchard and ice floes, though some middle passages drift into abstraction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above ice floes creates genuine pressure—the groaning ice threatens throughout, embodying the community's precarious peace. The vintage store mirrors function as more than decoration, enabling the key reconstitution that drives resolution. Strong sensory work with "fruit that held small moons" and ice that "bit at each other like tired wolves."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The central conflict between orchard keepers and ice fishers over "stolen light" escalates through the narrator's mirror-work revelation of their shared wound—a child's death. The proposed solution (beacon saplings, paired watches) carries real cost in time and cooperation. While pressure builds steadily, the resolution feels slightly too neat given the depth of the original grievance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of collective healing through shared responsibility emerges organically from the mirror reconstitution revealing "not futures but the underside of choices." The final line "practice, finally, is how peace keeps" offers resonant closure without moralizing. The child becomes "the courageous anomaly who insists that rules bend toward care," transforming tragedy into principle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong lyrical voice with consistent POV modulation—"my coat smelling of brine and smoke and unslept prayers." The perceptual signature shows in selective details like reading mirrors for "lost angles" and seeing ice floes as "tired wolves." Some passages drift toward abstraction ("shadows lace me tighter") but rhythm control remains strong throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. Information density is high in passages like "We would plant beacon saplings along the floe lanes and rig them with heatless light." Some abstract phrasing weakens immediacy ("the reconstituted sphere hover again around us") and occasional overwriting ("unslept prayers," "courageous anomaly") without full payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The vintage store mirror reconstitution offers a fresh approach to conflict resolution, avoiding typical mediation tropes. The specific solution of beacon saplings with "heatless light" shows inventive world-building. The piece commits to its lyrical register and metaphysical premise without retreat, though some elements feel slightly overwrought.</comment>
