I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through lyric accumulation and pattern repetition rather than causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's evolution from curator of darkness to tender of gardens shows genuine transformation with embodied cost. The internal contradiction between vigilance and devotion plays out through concrete choices, particularly in the hesitation before signing the treaty. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("photosynthesize pain into beauty") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the protagonist's transformation from insomniac isolation to gentle tender, with visible cost in the treaty signing and breath-written vow. The accumulative lens holds consistently through repeated refrains and deepening imagery. Deduction for slight orientation delay (shell location/nature unclear initially) and some causality softness in the Gardener's arrival mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell functions brilliantly as both setting and constraint, its chambers and nacre whorls shaping movement and transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("drip and creak," "humid, vegetal"). The shell's evolution into living gardens directly enables the final transformation, making environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the protagonist's journey from isolation to connection, with the treaty requiring genuine renunciation of "confusing sharpness with safety." The cost manifests in breathing the vow that transforms the shell's interior. One meaningful deepening through the Gardener's arrival that forces the choice between solitude and connection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of pain into beauty without explicit moralizing. The recurring "via half-sung lullabies" motif accumulates meaning from fractured notes to brave choir. The final image of tending gardens while "coaxing pain to photosynthesize into beauty" offers a resonant answer to the central question of how to process suffering.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("walls holding echoes of ink and salt"). The taught pattern of repetition ("via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind") pays off in the choir's return. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that strains the established voice ("vegetal," "chlorophyll").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, some figurative density in peak moments ("photosynthesize pain into beauty," "reef-shadow joy") creates opacity without clear pattern-teaching. Template repetition of "via half-sung lullabies" works as intentional refrain but occasional abstract phrasing ("amnesty ports") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of insomnia, shells, and gardening creates an original emotional landscape. The concept of a "blossom armistice" and "Gardener of Thorns" transforms expected imagery. The transformation of a shell into living gardens through breath and sorrow offers genuine originality in its specific execution.</comment>
