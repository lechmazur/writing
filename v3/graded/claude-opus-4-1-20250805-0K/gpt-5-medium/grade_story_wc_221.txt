<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's complex identity as "blessed pariah" drives consistent internal contradiction throughout, with the compass rose applique serving as both anchor and map for navigation through temporal confusion. The final choice to create "a navigable field where confusion once thrashed" shows earned transformation through specific struggle, though some interiority edges toward abstract reflection rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered time perception building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist creates "a true north of devotion to what persists." The cost is legible in accepting the role of pariah ("We will not fear the dark we carry") and the temporal isolation. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the closure transforms confusion into navigational method with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The time dilation deck functions as active setting that constrains perception and enables the protagonist's unique navigation method—time stretches allow layering of anniversary sketches across temporal shells. Sensory detail like "dust hesitated between falling and floating" and "each car a beetle dragging time across its shell" creates vivid POV-filtered atmosphere that directly shapes the final solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation reads through accumulative deepening as temporal disorientation intensifies ("stars were not where they should be") forcing adaptation from traditional navigation to creating a new axis through layered time. The cost manifests in accepting permanent temporal isolation and pariah status, though the middle section could tighten pressure more directly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between mechanical navigation (compass needle) and chosen ground ("a traveler chooses what to call the ground"), culminating in the creation of personal true north through devotion rather than fixed points. The final image of meeting dawn "from several directions at once" resonantly answers the question of finding direction in temporal chaos without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through temporal awareness ("Hours passed in the language of the deck, a stretch and a fold"). Voice maintains consistency through lyric compression and pattern-taught repetition, though occasional abstract patches ("confusion into exploration") slightly dilute the concrete texture. The experimental time-perception remains legible throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "cathedral abandoned mid hymn" and effective rhythm variation, but some paraphrase loops appear ("echoed silence nested"/"echoed silence naming") and abstract phrases like "vein of intention" and "measured mercy" edge toward purple prose. Information density is high in stronger passages but occasionally dilutes with conceptual abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of using temporal distortion as navigation tool offers fresh angle on isolation and memory, with specific synthesis of family tradition and technological catastrophe. The transformation of compass rose from directional to temporal map ("past, present, elsewhere, and return") shows genuine ingenuity, though some elements feel slightly derivative of post-disaster fiction templates.</comment>
