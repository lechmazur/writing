I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through layered imagery, repetition, and pattern rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's "respectfully rebellious" stance drives consistent micro-choices throughout, from carrying the unauthorized jar to delivering the misrouted letter. The internal contradiction between following regulations and "fostering fragile ties" creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of "broken promises" as currency, though the final delivery to the boy demonstrates earned change with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece successfully builds through pattern (absences, promises, deliveries) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist understands delivery as "linking holes" rather than filling them. The orientation anchors (mailman, disputed territory, checkpoints) establish clearly by line 3. The cost manifests in the boy's transformed posture and breath. Deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the storm's cataloging sequence, though it pays off thematically.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The disputed territory setting actively constrains choices ("Everyone pretends not to notice, because noticing becomes a statement only bullets can grade"). Specific details like the creek tasting "faintly of pennies" from drone batteries and the "cobalt arcade at twilight" create vivid atmosphere. The setting functions as more than backdrop—checkpoints, smuggling drones, and the brittle hush all pressure the protagonist's navigation method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—delivering mail while fostering connections in a surveilled zone—intensifies through the jar's mysterious contents and culminates in the unauthorized delivery. The progression from routine mail to storm-jar to misrouted letter shows escalation. Cost is visible in the risk taken ("the rebellion I can afford") and the boy's emotional transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of connection through absence ("we should be linking the holes") emerges organically from the navigation method and crystallizes through Mina's wisdom. The recurring motif of broken promises as currency gains depth when reframed as linking rather than filling. The final image of walking the cobalt arcade "to find where broken promises heal, one route more" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature throughout ("maps hold their breath," "the air folds into a brittle hush"). The voice maintains consistent poetry while remaining grounded in concrete action. Dialogue between narrator and Mina feels natural with appropriate subtext. Minor deduction for occasional elevation that slightly exceeds the mailman's established register ("cataloging absence").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied rhythm. Information density is high—most lines advance multiple layers. Deductions for occasional overwrought moments ("promises whisper loudest, as if they were coins rolling after closing") and some template repetition in structure ("I walk," "I find," "I stay"). The "respectfully rebellious" phrase appears twice identically.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a mailman navigating disputed territory by "linking absences" offers a fresh angle on border narratives. The storm in a bottle as weather charm/healing catalyst avoids cliché through specific execution. The transformation of "broken promises" from currency to connective tissue shows genuine insight. Some familiar elements (smuggling drones, checkpoints) prevent higher scoring.</comment>
