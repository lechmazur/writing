<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The courtesan's motivation to "defy the lullaby of conformity" drives consistent action through her ritual of harvesting echoes, with embodied details like "each toe-writing a measured rune." The character's chastity as "chosen emptiness that could unlock the crowded vaults" provides clear internal logic. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("bodily poetic") that occasionally replaces concrete embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught repetition ("alarming serenity," "bodily poetic," "between sigh and smile") building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the city "learning slowly how to refuse and still sing" shows clear cost through the guards' "pikes sighing into frost." The ritual's completion transforms collective speech with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—she must "unlock its throat by untangling threads"—with vivid sensory detail like "threads no thicker than snowlight." The underground looms that "did not weave cloth but resonance" create spatial coherence. Slightly abstract at times but the environment actively shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal ritual to city-wide transformation as "People woke speaking their own truths in unison," with clear cost shown through the guards' paralysis and the protagonist's risk ("panic snags thread"). The window "between sigh and smile began to shrink" creates time pressure that forces completion despite patrol arrival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the harvest of suppressed voices becoming "a voice larger than any single speaker," with the final image of the city learning "how to refuse and still sing" offering resonant answer without moralizing. The prism as recurring motif accumulates meaning from glass chapel to bell, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled repetition and rhythm, though occasionally drifts into elevated register ("chaste courtesan," "bodily poetic"). The taught pattern of phrase repetition serves accumulative structure. Some filter-verb clusters ("she knew," "she felt") in middle sections reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with purposeful repetition, but template cadence appears in sequences like "She knelt...She knew...She guided...She had learned." Mixed metaphors occasionally muddle ("snow sifted like slow fire"). Strong opening and closing lines, but middle sections show some paraphrase loops around the thread-untangling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a courtesan whose chastity enables voice-harvesting offers fresh angle on familiar archetypes. The underground looms that translate palace speech into counterchant show conceptual originality. Some elements feel template-driven (mystical ritual, defying conformity) but the specific synthesis of glass prism and voice-weaving creates memorable particulars.</comment>
