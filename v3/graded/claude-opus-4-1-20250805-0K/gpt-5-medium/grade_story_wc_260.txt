<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal conflict between maintaining hope for the shelter and confronting the broker's betrayal drives concrete micro-choices throughout (removing fake terrarium decorations, writing the honest donor letter). The final choice to place the tail tip beside the broker's brochure as "two small relics of belief, distinct in how they refused to heal" crystallizes a earned stance on trust with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds through layered metaphors of healing/amputation that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration where removing what "refuses to heal" applies equally to the chameleon's tail and the shelter's false promises. The cost is legible in "I would reconstruct trust not with grand bargains, but with small nocturnes" and the final image of waiting "until the mist thinned and the stars tired of listening."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The misty workshop atmosphere pervades every beat, from "mist lay thin as breath" to the final "let the stillness shimmer," creating a hermetic space where precision work occurs. The terrarium's transformation (removing "plastic waterfall, fake blossoms, branded thermometer that lied") constrains the narrator's choices and mirrors the larger institutional stripping of vanity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from treating a small injury to confronting institutional betrayal, with the surgical amputation serving as both literal action and metaphorical choice about what to preserve. The line "We will take only what refuses to heal. / But always, we will leave you yourself" articulates the cost clearly, and the narrator's commitment to transparency despite donor anger shows agency foreclosing the easier path of deflection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme emerges through the concrete parallel between surgical amputation and institutional reform, avoiding abstract moralizing. The final placement of tail tip and brochure as "two small relics of belief, distinct in how they refused to heal" offers a non-literal answer about necessary severance that reweights all prior healing imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines medical precision ("forceps," "sutures") with lyrical compression ("stars listened," "shimmering stillness"), creating a perceptual signature of someone who sees the poetic in clinical work. The controlled modulation from technical procedure to philosophical reflection maintains coherence while the rhythm tightens during the actual surgery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("no bigger than a torn leaf vein") and purposeful repetition ("misty workshop under stars"). Some template cadence appears mid-story ("I counted tinctures, counted sutures, counted the apologies") and occasional abstraction ("fragile convictions," "honest shape") slightly dulls immediacy, though the closing image lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of wildlife rehabilitation with institutional betrayal creates an unexpected parallel that feels earned through the amputation metaphor. The specific detail of removing branded thermometers and plastic waterfalls while performing delicate surgery on a chameleon's tail tip offers fresh texture to the familiar corruption narrative.</comment>
