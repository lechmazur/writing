<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation—seeking truth about his bureaucratic erasure and possible poisoning—drives consistent choices through concrete actions like collecting story fragments and confronting the widow. Internal contradiction emerges effectively through his inability to say her name while remembering everything else, and the final choice to leave the label as "small verdict" shows earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through layered fragments (overheard stories, poison label, mechanic's information) toward a Charged Poise closure where the narrator leaves the label for the widow to "choose whether to inventory truth or keep the ledger balanced." The cost is legible in both the narrator's ongoing erasure and the widow's trembling recognition, with the ocean as persistent constraint shaping his ghostly existence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shipping container labyrinth functions as more than backdrop—it enables the narrator's invisibility and shapes his navigation "between the red and blue corridors." Sensory detail like "bitter" fingertips from touching the poison label and "oily constellations" in the water creates texture, though the warehouse scene could use more spatial specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from passive collection to active confrontation as fragments accumulate (cleaners' whisper → poison label → mechanic's information → widow's arrival), with each discovery narrowing the narrator's options toward confrontation. The final choice to leave evidence rather than expose directly shows agency through renunciation, though the widow's response could carry more immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of bureaucratic erasure making one both victim and witness, with the narrator filtering reality "differently" to see what official records obscure. The final image of the city "layering new stories over the old" resonates without moralizing, suggesting how erased histories persist beneath official narratives.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice filters perception through maritime and industrial imagery ("secrets stacked like cargo," "memory palace rusted by salt"), with consistent POV modulation showing how erasure affects cognition. The metaphor of eyes as "sieves" versus "pitchers" establishes the narrator's unique perceptual signature early and maintains it through pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical density occasionally tips toward overwriting ("paperwork moves faster than tides," "ocean coughed me back"), though most figurative language serves the industrial/maritime atmosphere. Some redundancy in the walking/listening pattern, but prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structures and the "bitter" taste detail lands with specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of a bureaucratically dead person investigating their own murder transforms the familiar unreliable narrator through specific world-building where "guards forget me because their clipboards say I am gone." The execution commits fully to the consequences of official non-existence, though the widow confrontation follows expected beats.</comment>
