I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered moments and sensory details toward Ada's emotional release during the eclipse.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ada's grief and the therapist's patient approach create genuine emotional texture. The locket as embodied grief works well, and Ada's final gesture of tracing "the old question into the air, not to answer it, but to keep it alive" shows mature understanding of loss. Minor deduction for the therapist remaining somewhat transparent as a character beyond their professional role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure builds effectively toward Ada's moment of release during totality. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Ada traces the question mark and accepts wonder as love, with visible emotional cost. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (sage ridge location emerges gradually) and because the therapeutic frame somewhat insulates the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong sensory layering: "ravens wrote cursive in the sky," "silver as shadows grew crisp like paper cuts." The eclipse functions as setting that constrains and shapes the emotional moment. The tree with "dreaming roots that pressed up like knuckles" provides grounding physicality that matters to the scene's intimacy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The eclipse provides natural escalation as light thins toward totality, paralleling Ada's emotional opening. The therapist's choice to hold the locket on the guitar creates meaningful risk. However, the therapeutic frame somewhat cushions dramatic stakes - this is guided healing rather than raw conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through action: "wondering is a form of love" crystallizes organically from Ada's gesture with the curl. The eclipse as metaphor for grief/renewal avoids heavy-handedness. "Ordinary magic is not a rebellion against the world; it is the world doing what it does when we notice" resonates without preaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive lyrical voice with controlled rhythm: "I began with a scale that leaned toward blue, letting my thumb drape notes one by one from the kalimba teeth." The therapist's perspective maintains professional restraint while allowing poetic perception. No head-hopping, consistent focalization throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clean, musical prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Some moments edge toward overwriting ("the moon bit into the sun like a patient moth") but generally maintain restraint. Information density is high - most sentences advance emotion, atmosphere, and story simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The integration of music therapy with eclipse observation offers a fresh frame for grief work. While therapeutic scenarios aren't novel, the specific details (kalimba, the curl's question mark shape, teaching lullaby in lower key) create authenticity. The piece commits to its gentle approach without forcing dramatic confrontation.</comment>
