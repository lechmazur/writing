<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict between being "discoverer or person" drives meaningful choices, particularly the final act of pouring soil and breathing life into "unkindled solace." The chimera twin concept creates genuine contradiction acting in scene. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("trapped freedom" as feeling) that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure - the protagonist releases their ledger and plants the empty jar, accepting transformation with visible cost. The emerald card's transformation from pigment to permission to compass shows clear progression. Minor opacity in early spatial anchoring (ship's geography unclear) prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The carnival ship setting actively constrains choices - carousel horses point directions, mirrors cloud perception, the ship "adjusts its corridors." The emerald light mapping constellations onto boards is particularly effective. Setting doesn't quite reach 9+ because it doesn't definitively constrain the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure - from discovering the chimera twin in one's tongue, to finding the jar of soil, to the final breathing life into silence. The cost ("for each name you speak, you lose the twin") is stated clearly but could be more viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the garden of forgotten names and the paradox of discovery requiring forgetting. The final image of setting the card "above my heart, a compass that pointed toward whoever I would become" resonates without moralizing. Slight deduction for one instance of theme-speak ("trapped freedom").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("memories alter" as refrain, "not-mine voice"). Strong perceptual signature in how the narrator notices carnival decay. Experimental elision works well and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("ferris wheel leaned like a compass needle resting on the lip of the world"). Some repetitive phrasing around "narrative threads" and occasional abstract constructions ("trapped freedom," "unkindled solace") that could be more concrete. No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The chimera twin discoverer concept and garden of forgotten names create fresh angles on identity/memory themes. The carnival ship as liminal space for self-discovery shows originality. Doesn't quite reach higher bands due to some familiar elements (mysterious ship, quest structure).</comment>
