<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "ground restless spirits kindly" drives consistent choices through the unraveling ritual, with embodied tension in "the needle hummed against my skin, not with sound but with a gentle vacuum." The final renunciation of banishment for grounding shows earned character cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around emotional states ("lucid unrest") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silence literally accumulates through the needle's work, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where "the hush changed weight, no longer interlaced with panic but with choosing to stay." Cost is visible in the transformation from restless to grounded spirits. The orientation anchors (prism sanctuary, mask restorer, under starlight) establish clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sanctuary's prismatic architecture actively constrains the ritual work—"Each facet of glass stitched shadows to stars"—while the net's physical knots hold trapped breath that must be carefully released. The needle as micro-setting tool that "accumulates silence" directly enables the grounding work. Environment shapes every choice from climbing iron stairs to catching memories with stones.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as each knot releases more dangerous content—"When horror rose, we gave it breath enough to sigh"—building to the masks' transformation. The dominant stake (grounding spirits without banishment) faces consistent pressure through resistant knots and the near-fall. Cost is visible in the careful labor and the spirits' final choice to stay rather than flee.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete work of transforming unrest into chosen stillness, never stated but embodied in "we braided joy with grief so it would not drift away unanchored." The final image of the tide accepting "the shape of the shore" resonantly answers the central question about accommodation versus banishment. No moralizing; meaning accumulates through specific ritual actions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in synesthetic descriptions like "the needle caught each bead without letting it fall" and controlled rhythm that tightens during the ritual work. Minor dialogue effectively carries subtext ("Here, she said, is where we keep what the sea would take, but not forever"). Some filter constructions ("I felt") could be more immediate but voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong imagistic density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Tools like this teach you that silence can be a thing that accumulates." Some repetitive constructions around "we [verb]" in the middle section and occasional abstract phrasing ("lucid unrest," "interlaced hush") that could be more concrete. No loops or scaffolding, but figurative density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of accumulating silence through a needle that creates "a gentle vacuum where sound would be" offers a fresh synthesis of repair and exorcism. The specific ritual of unraveling centuries-old knots to release trapped breath transforms the expected ghost story. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens the otherworldly stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
