<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The violinist's motivation to "unbind the silence" drives concrete micro-choices throughout—playing unfinished songs, giving Lark the marble, following the map of "halves and almosts." Internal contradiction emerges through the tension between finishing/unfinishing, with the final choice to embrace "beginnings" earned through accumulated particulars like the mother's torn map story.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece builds density through layered images (sunken orchard, shipwrecks, mendicant's bowl) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "pockets full of beginnings" reweights the opening's "chronic hush." Cost is legible in the line "not to break, but to release, so wood can remember its tree without forgetting the ocean"—showing the price of holding both states.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse-shipwreck-orchard trinity constrains choices throughout: characters must gather "inside the greenhouse," music must work within "brackish light," and the setting's hybrid nature (fruit/driftwood) charges the final image of "footprints on the greenhouse steps." The environment actively shapes how the violinist can "unbind" through its physical properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulative deepening: from playing alone to gathering children/elders, from single notes to shared stories, from individual objects in the bowl to collective "gentle obligations." The dominant stake—finding beauty in the unfinished—tightens when Lark's question forces articulation of the philosophy, with cost visible in accepting "magnificent simplicity" over completion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the unfinished/finished dialectic without explicit moralizing, crystallizing in "a song that refuses to be done." The bowl's accumulation of broken objects (marble, one-winged seed, warped coin) embodies the thematic question, while the final image of footprints as an unfinished song offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior incompletions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through acoustic specificity ("breakwater murmurs," "thin tremolo of wind in rigging") and the narrator's tendency to hear music in everything. Lyric compression serves the accumulative mode, with controlled rhythm shifts from longer meditative passages to shorter declarations like "Fire drew words out of wood."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "pear branches swam through panes, roots drinking brackish light" combines setting, atmosphere, and thematic work. Some mild figurative density in places ("ghostly greenhouse moon") but serves the lyric mode. Clean propulsion through varied syntax, no loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with musical healing and the specific concept of "unfinished beauty" feels fresh and earned. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and the choice to resist resolution ("songs that never finish") heightens stakes while maintaining clarity through the greenhouse gathering frame.</comment>
