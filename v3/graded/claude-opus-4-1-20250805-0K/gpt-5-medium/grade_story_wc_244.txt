<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The logistician's character drives authentic choices through concrete actions (organizing supplies, distributing postcards, placing moon rock) with clear internal contradiction between "desperately jocular and softly tired." The final gesture of slipping the moon rock into a child's pocket and "quietly mislaid their own name" shows earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the station transforms from disused to "a ledger of kindness disguised as light." The moon rock's journey from ritual object to child's pocket and the narrator's received map of favors crystallize options with felt cost. Orientation anchors early ("disused railway station") and the closure lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The station setting constrains choices throughout—the ivy flags down the trolley, the leaking skylight forces candle routes, the platform becomes canvas for constellation-mapping. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("rain that smelled like green metal"). The station's transformation from abandonment to utility charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cure for loneliness) signaled early and deepens through accumulation—from rumor to gathering to concrete acts of reciprocity. The arrival of the neighbor-dragged trolley instead of the mythical train forces acceptance of community-scale solutions over miracles, with visible cost in the logistician's withdrawal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars without moralizing—the moon rock as democratic floor-holder, postcards "prepaid by whoever hugged you last," the trolley of thermoses replacing the mythical train. The final image of the station as "a ledger of kindness disguised as light" offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior exchanges.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout with controlled lyric compression ("Order arrived as a kind of polite anarchy"). Voice maintains coherent texture through inventive constructions ("They had the smile of someone who had traded sleep for maps") without head-hopping. Rhythm accelerates during the rain sequence while preserving clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("They redirected leftovers from a shuttered hotel to the station, and laughter from the station to the street"). No loops or scaffolding, strong verb choices throughout. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("particular pressure and fizz") but propulsion remains strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of disaster relief logistics with loneliness-curing transforms both concepts through specific execution. The moon rock as democratic talking stick and postcards "prepaid by whoever hugged you last" show genuine inventiveness. The rumored train that never arrives but manifests as neighbor-dragged trolley subverts expectation meaningfully.</comment>
