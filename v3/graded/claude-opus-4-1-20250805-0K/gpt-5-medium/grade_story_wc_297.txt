I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the maze transforms from trap to grammar.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The root-bound narrator's literal grafting creates a compelling physical constraint that shapes choices throughout. Internal conflict between anxious elation and the pull of covenant/freedom operates simultaneously in scene. The scar-linking mechanism and final choice to offer a braided vow show earned character development, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("purposefully curious about the shape of the breach").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from grafted isolation through scar-linking to maze navigation and covenant renegotiation. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when "the maze reconfigured, less a trap than a grammar" with visible cost in the cambium-sealed vow. Orientation anchors (cobalt glade, root-bound to maple) establish early. The "future arrives early" temporal concept maintains coherence throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt glade functions as active setting - leaf-veins with "residual lightning from tomorrow" establish the temporal distortion that constrains all choices. The floating maze that "accepted our weight like a question accepts an earnest try" transforms setting into navigable grammar. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (wax paper scent, silver gull scar). The maze's reconfiguration at closure directly charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on renegotiating the eclipsed covenant after temporal disruption. Escalation builds through scar-linking discovery, maze navigation requiring joined pain, to confrontation with gardeners. The braided vow represents genuine cost - replacing circular perfection with acceptance of contradiction. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as patterns deepen, though the gardeners' threat could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the maze transforming from trap to grammar - learning "how to say yes without erasing no." The eclipsed covenant's withering under temporal pressure explores promises' fragility. Subtext operates through images (maze topiary as escape blueprint, scars as bridges). The final reconfiguration offers a non-literal answer about navigating contradiction without false resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled lyricism - "leaf-veins lit with residual lightning from tomorrow" establishes texture immediately. Perceptual signature remains consistent through botanical/temporal imagery. Dialogue carries subtext ("When skin remembers, it makes bridges"). Some moments edge toward elevated register ("anxious elation steadied me, a paradox you can lean on") but rhythm control under pressure holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs - "a maze topiary clipping wrapped in wax paper and rumor" layers object, texture, and uncertainty. Some abstract phrasing ("purposefully curious about the shape of the breach") and occasional register elevation reduce immediacy. Syntax varies purposefully, supporting the accumulative build. The "grammar" transformation crystallizes without overexplanation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of temporal distortion ("future arrives early") with botanical grafting and maze navigation creates non-obvious resonance. The scar-linking mechanism for sharing maps transforms the wound/healing trope. The covenant's eclipse and reconstitution as braided rather than circular shows conceptual integrity. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
