<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "translate isolation into independence" drives concrete actions through the shell interaction and memory transfer, with embodied emotions like "winter in my chest, a precise cold that did not sting." The choice to accept the child's memory shows internal conflict resolved through action with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("charmed skeptic") that occasionally replaces embodied detail.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist becomes "a quiet archive" carrying the child's winter memory, with visible cost ("weight of years settle on my tongue"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and resonance structures build to the memory transfer. The transformation from seeking independence to becoming a "bearer of weather" lands with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The velvet garden setting actively participates through the fountain as conduit and the dawn timing as catalyst ("when the last star fades...the garden delivers its true letter"). Sensory details like "moths drifted with ghostly resolve" and "bruise of cobalt being peeled back" create atmosphere while the shell-fountain-stone interaction constrains the ritual's method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: shell to fountain, feeling the "smallest shiver," the child appearing with "pressure, like weather pushing against a door," then the negotiated transfer. The cost manifests as carrying "winter in my chest" and becoming responsible for the memory. Stakes deepen from personal transformation to accepting another's burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of isolation into a different kind of independence—"not by leaving the world, but by carrying it cleanly." The final image of "a child sleeps without waves at the door" resonates without stating a moral. The recurring motifs of weather, archives, and resonance structures accumulate meaning rather than asserting it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric register ("velvet garden," "tragically radiant sky") and consistent POV filtering through the protagonist's poetic perception. The perceptual signature shows in phrases like "listening for something already here" and "sealed by salt and time." Minor deduction for occasional elevation that strains ("anteroom and afterthought").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong imagery and rhythm in passages like "pacing like a bright animal through a corridor of shut doors," but some abstract phrasing dilutes momentum ("negotiating with the sealed thing"). Template structures appear in the parallel "I told/I promised" constructions. Information density is generally high with multi-layered sentences serving character and atmosphere simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of transferring a quarantined memory through resonance structures offers a fresh angle on emotional burden and healing. The specific synthesis of seashell, garden, and memory archive creates an organic whole. The transformation from isolation to carrying others' weather meaningfully subverts expected independence narratives.</comment>
