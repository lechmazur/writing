<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to prevent perfection-induced collapse is clear and rooted in personal loss (mother's fate), with embodied grief in handling the bottled whisper. The final choice to print the clause that destabilizes perfection carries visible cost—accepting imperfection over the perfect moment with mother—though some interiority relies on abstract concepts rather than concrete sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as frost patterns, whispers, and printing accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator accepts wobble over perfection, with the mother-memory circle as crystallized cost. The closure lands with "all awakenings must rustle, or else drown" as the new orchard law, though the middle section's causality between printing and library's response could be more explicit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass orchard library as setting directly constrains choice—its need for imperfection to stay afloat drives the central conflict. Sensory details like "frost feathered the inner bellies of glass apples" and the cloud sea "lapping at roots like patient teeth" create lived-in specificity that charges the final image of negotiated floating.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from maintaining library balance to confronting personal loss when the whisper transforms the printing, forcing a choice between perfection (sinking) and wobble (survival). The cost is legible in the brief mother-moment that must end, though the middle lacks a clear tightening beat before the final choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between perfection and survival, with the mother's wish for "one perfect instant" embodying the fatal allure of stasis. The final law "wobble, murmur, agree, and float" offers a non-literal answer that embraces necessary imperfection, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature in "cryptic letterpress operator" voice with controlled lyric rhythm and purposeful compression ("reality became negotiable"). The prose modulates with pressure, tightening during the printing sequence, and metaphoric consistency holds throughout without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The wind of the cloud sea hummed, and the branches answered with rustling awakenings"). Some abstract phrasing ("negotiation had not ended; it had deepened") and occasional synonym proximity ("rustling awakenings"/"rustling awakenings rose") prevent higher scoring, but no loops or scaffolding mar the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of printing press as reality-negotiator with glass library growing book-fruit creates memorable world-logic. The concept of imperfection as survival mechanism transforms familiar perfectionism themes through specific detail, though the metaphysical premise itself echoes established surrealist traditions.</comment>
