I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through lyric accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Kio successfully sends herself as fabric to her brother, with visible cost in her own thinning.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kio's motivation to reach her brother across impossible distance is clear and embodied through concrete actions (weaving puzzle edges, using amber bead, thinning herself). The sacrifice is earned through "to send herself she must thin herself" with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("raveling silence," "patient frequency") that occasionally dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the fabric becomes wind on brother's face and "he knew he had been held," with clear cost in Kio's thinning. The accumulative structure coheres through weaving metaphor. Slight opacity in early passages ("measured possibilities by the tremor of leaves") doesn't harm closure but prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forgotten orchard and bamboo forest create atmospheric pressure, with specific details like "apricot blossom dust" and "tin bowl" grounding memory. The loom and puzzle edges constrain choices effectively. Some passages lean abstract ("hush of time's unraveling tapestry") but setting ultimately serves the weaving/sending action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from setting puzzle edges to weaving memories to the decisive thinning/sending. The cost is explicit ("latent sacrifice in each fiber"). The barrier (dead river, distance) creates genuine pressure though the conflict remains primarily internal/situational rather than actively opposed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the weaving metaphor—connection across impossible distance requires sacrifice and transformation. The amber bead "fossilizing a gnat mid-thought" resonates with suspended communication. The ending reweights all prior weaving as both literal craft and metaphysical bridge without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm, though occasionally overwrought ("raveling silence tugging at the hems of memory"). No dialogue to evaluate. Some register elevation doesn't quite match a weaver's likely lexicon ("stoically sparkling," "constellated oath") but the poetic compression mostly serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with strong moments ("edges define a world") but frequent abstraction and elevated diction create opacity. Phrases like "patient frequency" and "letterless thought" strain clarity. The filter-verb stack ("felt," "knew," "smiled") in closure beats and some metaphor density ("cloth thinking") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weaving, puzzle edges, and communication across death/distance. The specific combination of bamboo fiber loom with jigsaw borders as message frame feels original. The transformation of self into weavable material that can travel as wind is an inventive take on separation/connection themes.</comment>
