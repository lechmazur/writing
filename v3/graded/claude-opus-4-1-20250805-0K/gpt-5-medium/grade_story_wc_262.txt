<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystal gazer's internal journey from expertise-as-distance to recognizing her own shelved love demonstrates strong contradictory impulses acting in scene, particularly when she discovers her own name in the warehouse. The final choice to mark the shelf for others carries visible cost—acknowledging years lost to professional detachment. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "unused love" that occasionally drifts toward concept rather than embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks and density increases that reweight the dominant stake—unused love as active, waiting presence rather than void. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she writes "stay, because what I mean is do not leave," transforming goodbye into invitation with clear emotional cost. The warehouse metaphor constrains choices throughout, and the final marking of the shelf shows visible price paid for self-recognition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The projection booth and its artifacts (projector, film, letters) effectively constrain the psychometry reading and charge the final image. Strong sensory work with "rain on velvet" and physical details like "blue dental floss" and "spattered table." The setting enables the central action while the tactile handling of objects grounds the abstract concept. Some passages lean conceptual but the booth-as-container works well.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as the crystal gazer moves from professional distance to personal recognition, with the key tightening when she finds her own name and must confront her shelved life. The cost is legible when she acknowledges "the life she had shelved while she touched other people's relics." The dominant stake—locating and understanding unused love—faces its test when she must apply her method to herself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of unused love as "overqualified, waiting in the wings with its costume pressed." The final realization that unused love exists "in the breath before yes" offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire piece. The recurring image of doors/thresholds pays off when goodbye letters become "doors...to thresholds nobody had stepped across."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric register and consistent POV that filters perception through the crystal gazer's spatial-emotional imagination. Strong perceptual signature in how she experiences feelings as architecture. Some elevated diction ("incubate a tender heat") occasionally strains but mostly serves the piece's textural mode. The metaphorical density works within the established pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm variations and high information density, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("tender heat," "modest growl") and occasional synonym loops around love/unused/stored concepts. The extended warehouse metaphor sometimes produces scaffold sentences. Strong opening and closing lines, with the final image of "hands learning to hold" effectively charging the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a psychometrist discovering her own unused love while reading others' abandoned farewells offers a fresh angle on familiar territory. The specific synthesis of projection booth, film strips, and goodbye letters creates an organic whole. The transformation of goodbye into invitation ("stay, because what I mean is do not leave") provides genuine surprise that feels earned.</comment>
