<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina's methodical hope despite insomnia creates genuine internal contradiction, particularly in her trust of the moon-tipped brush's "hunger more than sleep." The neighbor's transformation from grief recipient to active participant in spreading kindness shows earned character change with visible cost (his paint-mottled palms). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around kindness that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure where the greenhouse becomes "a small republic where kindness translated every border." The neighbor's arrival with the map creates meaningful deepening that reweights Lina's isolated practice into a discovered network. Cost is visible in years of unrewarded effort and the neighbor's aged, worn appearance. Slight opacity in the map's literal function prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse constrains and enables the entire story—its isolation allows Lina's nocturnal practice while its plants serve as witness and repository for offerings. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("saffron quiet," "peppery scent of tomato vines"). The moon-tipped brush functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when it "rested in its box, full."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of proving strangers remember kindness escalates through the neighbor's revelation that her work has spawned a network. The pressure coheres through accumulation—from individual offerings to the neighbor's map to the final tea ceremony. Cost is legible in Lina's years of methodical hope and the neighbor's journey following her trail.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the "old grammar of decency" and "lost languages" that people misplace but never lose. The final tea ceremony where they "spoke without words, fluent at last" offers resonant answer without stating a moral. The recurring gold dot as "seed of remembrance" accumulates meaning through the story.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Lina's artist's eye ("parceled its light into thin, forgiving coins") and lyric compression serves the accumulative mode. Some elevated diction ("saffron quiet," "methodically hopeful") fits the contemplative tone but occasionally drifts toward preciousness. Voice maintains consistency through the pressure of the neighbor's arrival.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The brush drank moonlight as if it remembered the mouth of a river"). Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("smog-choked city," "waxing moon's glow") but serves the lyric mode. Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "She [verb]" constructions. Strong opening and closing lines anchor the piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of art as anonymous kindness creating a secret network is fresh, avoiding standard artist-protagonist tropes. The moon-tipped brush as conduit for "lost languages" offers non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative mode pays off, though some imagery trends toward expected poetry ("saffron quiet").</comment>
