<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The myth buster's motivation crystallizes through concrete details like "gloomy cheerfulness" worn "like a raincoat" and his method of courting the sky's moods "like a gardener coaxing winter soil." His final realization that truth is "about kindness carried forward until it looks like gravity" arrives through earned struggle with the cello and shell, not epiphany. Minor deduction for the wind-figure's appearance feeling slightly convenient, though it serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong pattern-teaching through the cello's resonant hums building toward a Conceptual Repricing where "kindness carried forward until it looks like gravity" reweights the entire quest. Cost is felt through the myth buster's vulnerability ("he feels the riddle unclench like a fist") and the observatory's continued humming after he leaves. Orientation anchors arrive late (protagonist role clear only by line 3), triggering -0.3, though the atmospheric opening serves the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains and enables key choices—the dome's acoustics make the cello method possible, while the cliff location and fog create isolation necessary for the ritual. Micro-setting details like "the dome flickers" and "waves stitch hems on the cliff" actively participate in the transformation. The shell as painted compass provides crucial tactile feedback ("lacquered stars bite his palm") that guides the protagonist's attempts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—retelling the sky "before it could forget what it once promised"—deepens through accumulative pressure as each cello stroke builds resonance. The tightening occurs when "the compass moves only when he thinks of failure," forcing him to confront every disproved myth he loved. Cost manifests in vulnerability ("leaning in, listening for the riddle beneath the riddle") and the final acceptance that certainty was never the goal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the accumulation of paradoxes: "gloomy cheerfulness," truth that "likes small doors," and the final revelation about "kindness carried forward until it looks like gravity." The recurring motif of failed myths being loved rather than dismissed deepens with each mention. The ending's non-literal answer—that wrongness can "walk out politely" through kindness—reweights all prior attempts at myth-busting without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through inventive metaphors ("gulls flurried up like unfinished thoughts") and paradoxical constructions that mirror the protagonist's worldview. The perceptual signature—noticing how "the universe winced at falsehood"—remains consistent. Some metaphor density in peak beats ("dome becomes a book spine") slightly obscures clarity, though this serves the accumulative design's crescendo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The shell was his ephemeral compass, guiding not by north, but by how the universe winced at falsehood"). Some metaphor clustering in the middle third creates mild opacity ("Time smudges; he is both boy and man"). Minor template cadence in "He remembers...He retells...He asks" sequence, though varied enough to avoid mechanical feel.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of a myth buster who disproves stories while loving them, using a cello's resonance to decode universal riddles, feels genuinely fresh. The specific synthesis of musical vibration, painted constellations, and the idea that truth prefers "crooked lines when laughter is available" creates something memorable. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and the wind-figure's manifestation heightens meaning (+0.3).</comment>
