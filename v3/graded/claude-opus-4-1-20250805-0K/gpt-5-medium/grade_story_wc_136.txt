<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's journey from meticulous mapper to someone who "unbuttoned patterns" shows genuine transformation with visible cost (surrendering control/precision). Interior contradiction appears throughout ("analytically artistic, a compass with curiosity"), though some moments drift toward abstract labeling ("trembling certainty" repeated without embodiment).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns build toward the fortress revelation and final reconfiguration ("When we emerged, the hour reset, and I began anew"). The closure lands with conceptual cost—releasing rigid patterns to access truth—though the phantom train sequence could strengthen causality between discovery and transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The midnight square, depot, and fortress create atmospheric pressure that shapes choices (following pavement arrows, using the punch). "Seats unfolded like pages, offering margins to write new vows" exemplifies how setting constrains and enables action, though some descriptions remain ornamental ("chalk, rain, and something like thunder").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from following mysterious arrows to confronting "unspoken truths" with the fortress demanding proof of listening. The protagonist's agency drives the transformation through active choices (pressing the punch, laying down maps), with visible cost in surrendering cartographic precision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between mapping/measuring and spaces between lines, culminating in "You keep patterns, said the mouth, but they keep you." The final image of resetting the hour while beginning anew resonantly answers the central question about rigid patterns versus openness without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("I traced them carefully, letting instinct sharpen every measured stride"). Some passages achieve strong compression while others drift toward abstract register ("Dots appeared on my skinscape, constellations of avoided conversations everywhere") that strains the mapper's plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density varies—strong moments like "Each squeeze clipped circles from darkness, releasing faint clockwork clicks" contrast with abstract loops ("trembling certainty" appears twice identically). Several passages restate concepts without advancement, particularly in the fortress sequence where dialogue becomes expository.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The phantom train as transport to psychological fortress offers fresh angle on self-confrontation. "Map what you refuse to measure" and the punch creating patterns from absence show original synthesis, though some elements feel prompted rather than organic (the midnight hour framing).</comment>
