I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and somatic markers toward a resonant reconfiguration where the characters find a method to access buried memories through light painting and embodied signals.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied characterization through "fingers buzzing," "chest tightened when I misread the rhythm," and Mara's skepticism softening into acceptance. The characters' contradictory states (skeptic yet participating, seeking yet fearing memory) create authentic tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("willowglass hope") that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when they successfully access buried memories through their devised somatic method, with visible emotional cost ("her brother's last words," "my father's map"). The accumulative structure coheres through repeated imagery (muscovite, light paths, somatic markers). Slight opacity in the telepathy pill's exact function prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The light painting studio constrains and enables their memory work through the "floor rig," camera, and fiber wand. Vivid sensory detail in "threads of color throb across the canvased air" and "rain mapped the windows with fractally precise veins." The muscovite geode functions as micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on accessing painful memories without being destroyed by them. The static shock creates a meaningful disruption they must overcome through patience and method. Cost is visible when Mara confronts "her brother's last words" and doesn't flinch, showing earned endurance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete practice of creating "a grammar" from bodily signals to access what language cannot reach. The final insight that "the trick is kindness, and the kindness is a method, and the method is the cure" resonates without moralizing. The willowglass metaphor of bending without breaking enriches rather than explains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("threads of color throb," "telepathy pill recall regimen kicks") and controlled rhythm. The perceptual signature shows in how light is tracked "like woken animals." Some register elevation ("topology of memories") slightly strains the intimate POV but serves the conceptual work.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structures. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("willowglass hope" appears twice) and slight repetition in structure ("We stood," "We were," "We signaled").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of light painting, telepathy pills, and somatic communication creates an original approach to memory recovery. The specific detail of creating a gestural grammar ("two taps for yes, a long exhale for sorrow") transforms what could be generic healing into something particular and earned.</comment>
