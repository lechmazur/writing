I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal conflict between guilt and the need for resolution drives consistent micro-choices, from scraping frost to aligning the dish. The digital ghost shifting from the narrator's echo to the mentor's voice creates genuine surprise while maintaining causality. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("domestic echo of cosmic negligence") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds through radio static clearing, ink patterns, and porcelain shard handling toward earned acceptance. The closure lands with visible cost ("courage to continue anyway") and the recurring heartbeat counting frames both opening and ending. The orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the ghost's transformation pays off the established pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively constrains choices through its isolation and damaged equipment. The porcelain shard functions as micro-setting that enables action (scraping frost) and carries emotional weight. Sensory details like "snow settling like fine ash" and "milky colors smoldering beneath rime" create atmosphere while the spilled ink's movement toward heat shows environmental responsiveness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal guilt through technical challenge to philosophical acceptance, with the array's blindness forcing concrete action. The narrator's agency drives the recalibration sequence, and the mentor's revelation reweights the protagonist's understanding of their mistake. Cost is visible in the isolation and the team's scattering, though the resolution could press harder on immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of failure and wisdom, with the porcelain shard serving as both wound and lens. The mentor's insight about believing oneself "big enough to doom the sky" reframes the narrator's guilt without moralizing. The final image of counting continuing "anyway" resonates with earned acceptance rather than resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice maintains poetic compression while remaining comprehensible, with lines like "the hour tastes of midnight solace" showing controlled lyricism. The ghost's dialogue shifts believably from mimicry to mentor. Minor register elevation in places ("ephemeral patterns") sits slightly outside the established lexicon but doesn't break immersion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery, though some lines edge toward overwriting ("opaline," "stubborn metronome"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some abstract phrasing ("domestic echo of cosmic negligence") and occasional register drift dock points, but no loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The conceit of reading spilled ink patterns to translate machine signals offers fresh specificity. The transformation of the digital ghost from self-echo to mentor provides genuine surprise. The porcelain shard's evolution from wound to lens shows inventive use of a mundane object, though some metaphorical reaches feel slightly forced.</comment>
