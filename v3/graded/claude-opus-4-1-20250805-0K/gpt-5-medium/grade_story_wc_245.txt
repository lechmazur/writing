I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through sensory accumulation and pattern intensification rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "learn grief's native coast and soundings" rather than erase it shows sophisticated internal complexity. The final choice to carry the stillpoint and teach others to "dowse for bearings within" sorrow demonstrates earned transformation with visible cost—accepting rather than escaping pain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully: "The stillpoint is not escape but axis, a consent to pivot without erasing the radius." The cost is unmistakable—the protagonist accepts carrying their full grief-map rather than finding erasure. The accumulative lens holds throughout as sensory details build toward this crystallized understanding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest functions as more than setting—it constrains how the protagonist navigates (through touch and the ring's temperature changes) and charges the final image. Details like "bark syllables and moth wing idioms" create a lived-in sensory world that shapes the journey's mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulative deepening: from following musical notes to finding the stillpoint to accepting grief's full cartography. The meaningful turn occurs when the protagonist realizes the stillpoint "is not escape but axis," forcing acceptance of sorrow's permanence with clear cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically through the mapmaking metaphor—grief requires navigation, not erasure. The final image of stepping "from the ultrasonic forest carrying a hidden stillpoint" resonates without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer about how to live with loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice maintains distinctive texture through synesthetic perception ("I absorb languages through skin") and compressed poetic syntax. The perceptual signature—a blind mapmaker reading through touch—creates consistent, character-specific filtering throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional abstract phrasing ("uncharted emotional depths") could be more concrete. The rhythm varies naturally, accelerating through discovery and slowing for reflection, with strong control in peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The blind mapmaker who reads through touch offers fresh perspective on familiar grief-journey material. The synthesis of cartography with emotional navigation feels inevitable in hindsight, particularly the insight that grief needs mapping rather than erasure.</comment>
