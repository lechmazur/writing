<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict between abandoning and befriending his dream manifests through concrete micro-choices (barefoot steps, cheek to glass) with embodied emotion. The final renunciation to "keep meeting it, without demand" carries visible cost through the "glacial hush turn from marble to water." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("righteousness was only a mask for shame") that briefly slips into diagnostic territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts coexistence with his abandoned dream, with cost visible in "glacial hush turn from marble to water under his ribs." The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and maintains coherence through recurring water/silence imagery that accumulates pressure. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the sanctuary setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt and its wet pavements constrain the protagonist's barefoot choice and charge the final image through "coolness write careful letters on his soles." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("petrichor nostalgia," "rainlight clung to crystal veins"). The sanctuary functions as micro-setting that enables his reconciliation with the dream.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through textural deepening from physical sanctuary to internal acceptance, with the finch's arrival triggering recognition of the dream as "kin." The dominant stake (reconciling with abandonment) tightens when he realizes "leaving had seemed righteous then, but the righteousness was only a mask." Cost is legible but could be more visceral in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete paradox of making peace by "keep meeting it, without demand, until both of you are home." The final image of listening to "not ticking, like tide before surge" offers a resonant non-literal answer about presence within absence. The piece avoids moralizing while building complexity through the mask metaphor sequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through clock-specific awareness ("the not ticking," "measures designed to hold a silence") and water-based imagery. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance shifts during reflection. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("excruciatingly gentle" appears twice) that slightly strains the intimate voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("crystal whispering forecourt after rain" establishes setting, atmosphere, and emotional state). Some repetitive phrasing ("excruciatingly gentle" twice, multiple "mask for" constructions) and occasional abstract loops ("to make peace with an abandoned dream" restated in final line). Prose rhythm varies effectively between long contemplative sentences and short decisive actions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of clock-scribe vocation with silence-as-music offers a non-obvious angle on creative abandonment. The specific detail of "notations that were mostly blank, measures designed to hold a silence" transforms the familiar artist-and-muse dynamic. Risk-taking through the lyric accumulative structure heightens resonance without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
