<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's meticulous, observant nature drives consistent micro-choices under pressure, particularly the lateral movement and decoy charts that embody their methodical approach to threat. The internal tension between "credibly curious" and the need for "restraint" creates genuine contradiction acted out through evasive maneuvers rather than stated. Minor deduction for the figure's somewhat generic antagonist presence, though the narrator's specificity compensates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator returns to copying weather "without hurry," having preserved their integrity through lateral tactics—the cost is the ongoing surveillance and forced deception. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pressure builds through layered details (footsteps, message, figure's arrival) toward this earned stasis. The decoy charts and pigeon message create clear causality within the accumulative frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The courtyard setting actively constrains movement options ("progressing laterally to the arch...behind the fig") and provides resources (bench for decoys, fountain as metronome). Sensory hierarchy reflects the storm recorder's expertise: "pressure fell not forward, but sideways, like outcomes choosing alleys." The quarantine zone and museum spire expand the geography purposefully without excess detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from being followed to receiving the threatening message to direct confrontation, with the narrator's lateral movement and decoy deployment demonstrating agency under pressure. The cost manifests in forced deception and ongoing surveillance ("After being followed home, I had not become a hero, only a witness with a craft"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the figure arrives, forcing the tactical choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between institutional control and individual witness, with weather serving as metaphor for truth that "storms tell...where institutions edit them." The final image of continuing to copy weather "as it pleased" resonates as quiet resistance without stating a moral. The "integrity is a barometer too" line enriches without over-explaining.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive meteorological perception saturates the POV: "pressure as conscience," "barometric tremors braided with rumor." Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("You measure storms...so leave the rest alone" implies threat through logic). The voice maintains its measured, technical register even under stress, though occasionally edges toward elevated diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong information density, though some metaphorical density in non-pressure moments ("dusk pooled," "remembering of leaves") without clear payoff. Minor template cadence in "The nurse in me...clerk in me...sailor in me" sequence. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph structure support the contemplative pace.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of weather recording as resistance metaphor with specific execution through isobars, barometric pressure, and lateral movement tactics. The "credibly curious" stance and use of decoy charts show originality in handling surveillance threat. The quiet ending that refuses heroics while maintaining witness feels earned and non-obvious.</comment>
