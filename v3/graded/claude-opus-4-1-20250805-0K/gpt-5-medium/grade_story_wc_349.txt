I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through lyric accumulation of images and metaphors around the central quest, with density increase and pattern-teaching leading to a resonant reconfiguration at closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The vendor's motivation to "find the place where stories begin" drives consistent action through the quantifying absence method, with internal complexity shown through patience and ritual. The final choice to take the comma-seed manifests earned agency with visible cost ("the quiver of my own unfinishedness"). Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("I understood then that beginnings apply for release") rather than fully embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the vendor obtains the comma-seed, transforming their role from seller to keeper of beginnings. The "by quantifying absence" method creates coherent causality, and cost is visible in offering "my ledger of returned regrets" and "the quiver of my own unfinishedness." Slight opacity around the exact mechanics of entry prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass orchard library setting directly constrains choices - the vendor must navigate "past shelves of panes on which letters slept" and find the specific vellum door. The glass apple on its plinth functions as micro-setting that charges the final transformation. Sensory details like "moonlight shows what words intend when they forget to pretend" filter through the vendor's specific perspective.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of finding "where stories begin" escalates through the quantifying absence ritual, building pressure as the vendor counts "beats between drips of moonlight" to open the hidden chamber. The cost manifests in surrendering personal incompleteness to obtain the seed. One meaningful deepening occurs when the vendor discovers their true role as "clerk of that court."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the metaphor system of beginnings as prisoners seeking "glimmering parole," with the vendor as intermediary. The comma-seed as "so heavy with maybe" offers a non-literal answer about potential and incompleteness. The final image of "the first sentence, which now lay sleeping in my hands" resonantly reweights the opening without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled metaphoric density - "the air holding its breath like a courteous usher." The perceptual signature remains consistent through phrases like "I read the nowhere" and "weighed the hesitations." No dialogue to evaluate. Purposeful compression serves the accumulative mode, with the pattern taught early and maintained through closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "blanks shaped like forgiveness" and varied sentence structures. However, some metaphoric density borders on overwriting ("the floor accepted us as a sentence accepts well-placed commas"), and occasional abstract constructions slow momentum ("The method was simple to describe and difficult to endure"). Information density remains high overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of a "clean slate vendor" in a floating glass library offers genuine freshness, avoiding derivative templates. The quantifying absence method and the comma-seed metaphor for nascent stories show authentic vision. The synthesis of merchant, library, and creation mythology feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric density heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
