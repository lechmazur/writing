<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's gravitational response to emotion creates a unique embodied contradiction that drives the central lock-opening mechanism. The balance between joy and grief operates simultaneously in scene, particularly in "I learned to smile without fleeing, and to breathe until my shoes slightly kissed the deck." Shadow work integration shows genuine internal conflict through naming "angers I never used and the knives I never lifted," though some passages drift toward abstraction rather than embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through layered details (tears as maps, weight as key, compassion as ballast) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where opening reveals "not a weapon, but a chamber of seeds and sleeping words." Cost is visible in the protagonist's calibrated emotional labor and the promise to "only unseal what could be tended, not conquered." The orientation anchors (ship, alone, post-humanity) establish cleanly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The recycled ship and its contents (albums, photographs, greenhouse) constrain choices and enable the lock-opening through tear-salt navigation maps. Kwan Yin's tear functions as micro-setting that "cooled my pulse until I could look long enough to learn." The dimensional lock's physical properties (responding to emotional weight) create a unique spatial challenge, though some descriptive passages remain abstract rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gravitational lock creates escalating pressure through precise calibration requirements—"If I floated too far, the hatch shut; if I sank, the hinges screamed and sealed." Stakes deepen as shadow work reveals the necessity of holding both joy and grief simultaneously. The final opening carries cost in the protagonist's promise to guard what's unsealed, though the middle section could tighten its pressure points.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of emotional weight affecting physical gravity, avoiding direct statement. The final revelation that the chamber contains "blueprints for conversation" rather than weapons reweights the entire journey from conquest to tending. "Compassion without its shadow is brittle" integrates naturally through action rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends technical precision ("mass is a conversation you have with gravity and memory") with lyrical compression ("ghostly resolve," "moths"). The perceptual signature shows in unique formulations like "I am gravitationally lighter when happy" and maintains consistency even under emotional pressure. No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong moments of compression ("The ship was a quilt of hulls and histories") but several passages contain abstract loops: "waiting for a reader to pledge to carry both" followed by "I promised...to only unseal what could be tended" paraphrases the same content. Some filter-heavy constructions ("I realized," "I felt") dull immediacy in middle beats. The opening and closing lines effectively bookend with "ghostly resolve."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The gravitational-emotional correlation creates a genuinely fresh premise that transforms the lock-picking trope into embodied emotional labor. The revelation that the locked dimension contains seeds and words rather than weapons subverts expectation while remaining earned through the compassion-based opening mechanism. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode and conceptual physics heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
