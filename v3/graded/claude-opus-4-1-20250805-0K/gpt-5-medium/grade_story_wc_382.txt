<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "learn the language of old buildings" drives consistent choices throughout, with embodied details like tilting toward pipes and feeling timber tighten. The tutor character applies subtle pressure through teaching methods that force stance crystallization. Minor deduction for the final exchange lacking full embodied cost when the narrator doesn't look back.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator accepts the seal and its responsibility. The cost is felt in "sighed like wood does when it remembers rain" and the weight of not looking back. Orientation anchors who/where/when early through the building's stairwell and neighbor interaction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The building itself functions as micro-setting that constrains choices—its "syntax of weight and habit" drives the entire quest. Sensory details like "heat from his kettle made the hallway gentler" and meteor light making "each rooftop garden a cathedral" charge the final image. The seal's ivy crest that shows "strangling and embracing at once" perfectly mirrors the story's tension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from learning a building's language to accepting responsibility for "respectfully held illusions." The seal's weight accumulates meaning through ritual use, teaching scenes, and final transfer. Cost is legible when the narrator accepts the seal "because it knew how to bear weight" despite the tutor's ambiguous nature.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concept of "agreed upon lies" that buildings keep, developed through specific examples like the architect's courtyard deception. The final image of not looking back while "the sky finished speaking" resonates without stating a moral. The ivy seal's dual nature of strangling/embracing embodies the story's central paradox.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in how the narrator hears buildings as syntax rather than creaking. Voice modulates from analytical ("I did not interrogate the grammar") to lyrical ("small green prayers"). Dialogue carries subtext effectively, especially "Only as much as the Latin in the cornice."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, like "he was a tutor in dead languages, and then, almost cheerfully, said he was also a dead language tutor." Some figurative density in meteor passages but serves the accumulative pattern. Minor template cadence in "He said/He told" constructions but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story and urban mysticism through the specific concept of buildings as language-keepers. The transformation of borrowing sugar into mystical apprenticeship feels earned. Risk-taking in leaving the tutor's nature ambiguous pays off thematically.</comment>
