<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to resist thought taxation through guerrilla gardening is clear and consistent, with embodied details like the gourd seed in pocket serving as physical anchor for defiance. The final choice to perform public "artistic rehearsal" feels earned through accumulated pressure, though some interiority relies on abstract declarations ("I understood that a message should be heavier than a lie") rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural structure builds from individual resistance to collective action, with the final garden concert achieving Resonant Reconfiguration—transforming illegal thought into protected artistic expression with visible cost (the risk of arrest, the exposure). The closure lands with "A garden keeps the spark, and we keep watch," reweighting all prior planting as both literal and metaphorical resistance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively constrains and enables choices—bees muddy surveillance, glass amplifies heat under pressure, garden patterns become camouflaged communication. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("Moths slapped at the glass, mantises teetered like monks") with the environment functioning as both refuge and stage for resistance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual dismissal to collective resistance, with the audit towers' arrival forcing the decisive garden concert. The protagonist's agency drives the climactic transformation of illegal thought into protected performance art, with visible cost in the risk taken and the public exposure required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of cultivation—ideas literally planted, tended, and harvested as resistance. The final image of keeping watch over sparks resonates without moralizing, and the gourd rattle seed accumulates meaning from harvest march memory to concert catalyst.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice employs purposeful compression and inventive syntax ("I learned to breathe sideways") that serves the cryptic resistance theme. The "candidly cryptic" mode maintains consistency, though occasional register elevation ("converging chaos of too many rehearsed silences") slightly strains the established texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though some abstract declarations ("truth looks better in chitin and pollen") and occasional template phrases ("I stood on a crate and spoke") create minor friction. The inventive language mostly propels rather than ornaments, with strong rhythmic control throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of taxable thoughts transformed into garden resistance feels genuinely fresh, with specific details (calendula for consonants, beans for vowels) avoiding generic dystopia. The solution—exploiting an artistic rehearsal loophole—emerges organically from established elements rather than convenient invention.</comment>
