<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oracle's obsession with "quiet that can be written" drives her methodical mapping of silences, and her choice to stay while sending the courier away shows genuine cost—she accepts isolation to complete her work. The courier's arc from skepticism to understanding feels earned through his physical response to the mapped silence. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "reasons are sensations in costumes."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught mapping of silences that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration—the courier accepts his mission and the oracle commits to "walk the tide's erasures." The cost is visible: she bleeds into the stones, accepts isolation, knowing "the gold will keep flaking, and the star may die." The piece teaches its method early ("summarizing silence") and pays it off through accumulated gaps becoming coordinates.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The storm-tossed fort with its "ruined parapets" and "broken battlement" constrains choices—the oracle must scratch the map into stones knowing the booklet will deteriorate. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "Salt stings her knuckles," "towers hum with an ambered hush." The setting actively participates in the ending as she "draws them until her hand becomes calm weather."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Pressure builds through the courier's confession about burning records and his need for absolution, forcing the oracle's choice to give him the booklet while staying to complete the stone map. The dominant stake—preserving/transmitting knowledge of silence against erasure—tightens when she realizes "the gold will keep flaking, and the star may die." Cost is legible in her bleeding fingers and accepted isolation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of finding navigation through absence ("a map...of how the night moves through us when it outlives our names") emerges through concrete action of mapping silences. The final image of teaching the star her "cartography of pauses" while the courier carries the book to help "travelers...breathe along" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral. The piece earns its wisdom about endurance and transmission through specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and perceptual signature: "flaking like tired moons," "spine a small, stubborn horizon." The oracle's way of noticing—measuring gaps, reading silence—is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("I see a map beginning..."). Minor compression under stress ("Go, she says") maintains texture while appropriate to moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm variations and high information density. However, abstract register drift appears in peak moments: "reasons are sensations in costumes," "night wants a different costume," and some elevated diction ("lacunae," "merlons") that slightly strains the mystical-naturalistic register. The figurative language occasionally obscures rather than clarifies ("marbled hush pouring through the merlons").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of an oracle who maps silence rather than speaks prophecy offers a fresh angle on the oracle trope. The specific synthesis of storm, failing materials (flaking gold), and the urgency of preservation creates originality. The risk of using silence/absence as the central mapped element pays off through concrete dramatization. Transformation of the courier from destroyer to preserver adds depth.</comment>
