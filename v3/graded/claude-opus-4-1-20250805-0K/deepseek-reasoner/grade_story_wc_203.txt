I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and consistent, with his ghost-seeing ability creating genuine internal tension between professional duty and supernatural calling. The ghost's anxiety and Leo's "weightless burden" create embodied emotional states. Minor deduction for the ghost's somewhat convenient emotional resolution lacking intermediate complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal closure where discovery of the mainspring leads to the ghost's peace—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (her decades of anxiety). The lens is clearly Causal with because/therefore linkages throughout. The orientation anchors (elevator technician, Orpheum Grand, ticket office) establish cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dust patterns, brass grille, and orchestral cylinder constrain Leo's choices and enable discovery. Setting details like "soft as powdered sugar" dust and the water-stained medallion are purposeful and tactile. The mainspring's celestial engravings and the orchestral cylinder create specificity that charges the final resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (discovering ceiling secrets/resolving ghosts) escalates from observation to physical investigation to mechanical restoration. The ghost's increasing urgency and Leo's progression from passive reception to active problem-solving create meaningful tightening. Cost is visible in the ghost's decades of trapped anxiety finally released.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of hidden mechanisms—both literal (mainspring in ceiling) and figurative (unresolved stories). The final bell chime offers a non-literal answer about completion and peace. "Weightless burden" resonates throughout without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with professional precision ("vertical shafts," "industrial grease") that modulates appropriately during supernatural encounters. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Minor filter verb usage ("Leo understood") doesn't significantly impede immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some minor repetition ("Leo" appears frequently as subject) and occasional filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination of elevator technician and ghost-seer is fresh, though the resolution mechanism (finding hidden object to complete device) follows familiar patterns. The specific detail of the horologist's mainspring and orchestral cylinder elevates beyond pure template. The theatrical setting with circus imagery adds memorable texture.</comment>
