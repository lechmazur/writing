I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases toward a resonant reconfiguration. The fireflies' release and their transformation into "a river of living light" creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (her destitution as "necessary emptiness").

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal journey from "destitute philanthropist" to understanding transformation is earned through concrete embodiment—clutching the jar, feeling the "fine black grit," releasing the fireflies. The contradiction between emptiness and richness drives authentic change, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("flawed, human expression of this deeper need").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost: "Her poverty was the necessary emptiness that allowed the world to fill her." The accumulative structure builds through sensory layers (black sand, celestial bodies, fireflies) toward the final image of Elara "infinitely rich" on warm sand, though the middle section's abstract realizations ("fulfilling prophecies accidentally") slightly weakens causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The volcanic beach setting constrains and shapes the entire piece—the "fine black grit" that whispers, the "mineral-rich air" that revives the fireflies, the sand that "began to glow a faint, ethereal gold." Setting actively participates in transformation rather than decorating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: walking → unscrewing jar → fireflies rising → sand glowing → final understanding. The cost is legible (her destitution reframed as necessary), though agency remains mostly receptive rather than decisive—she's "orchestrated" by atmosphere rather than choosing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the fireflies' transformation from "captured light now faint" to "river of living light flowing into the steam." The texture of transformation—"rough like volcanic sand...soft like night air...luminous like fireflies"—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm ("a slow dance of celestial bodies...a stately procession"). Some register elevation feels forced ("palpable quiet so deep it seemed to hum"), and abstract passages occasionally lose the embodied perspective, but the perceptual signature of noticing light and texture remains distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("Their light caught the plumes of steam venting from the mountain's peak, illuminating them from within") but suffers from abstract loops ("fulfilling prophecies accidentally, setting in motion a chain of events") and some overwriting ("vibrant hush" appears twice as prompt-echo). Information density varies; the middle section particularly loses propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of philanthropy-as-cosmic-participation offers a fresh angle, and the fireflies' journey from childhood relic to volcanic offering feels earned. However, some conceptual elements (prophecy fulfillment, orchestrating coincidences) remain abstract rather than dramatized, limiting the piece's distinctive power.</comment>
