I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Determination:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages from dark lighthouse → discovery → understanding → action.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elvan's reticence and observational nature drive his investigation and final choice effectively. The ghost's motivation is poignantly rendered through the letters. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("profound relief") rather than pure embodiment at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from dark light to discovery to understanding to action, with Decisive Change closure as Elvan assumes keepership. Cost is visible in the ghost's fading and Elvan's life transformation. Slight deduction for the ghost's convenience as solution-provider.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lantern room and sea glass constrain choices and charge the final image beautifully. "Cold, dead eye" and the cairn messages create lived-in specificity. Minor deduction for some generic weather descriptions ("churning black cove").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from maintenance duty to life-saving responsibility with ship approaching. The ghost's fading creates genuine urgency. Deduction for relatively low personal cost to Elvan - his transformation feels convenient rather than sacrificial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of duty transcending death emerges organically through the letters and ghost's actions. The sea glass as repository of safety and the cairn messages create resonant non-literal answers. Final image of renewed protection lands powerfully.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elvan's taciturn perspective shapes selective perception well ("His large, quiet hands"). Some register elevation in narrative description ("luminescent ache," "hallowed") slightly exceeds his established voice. Clean POV maintenance throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum. Deductions for redundancy ("lonely and poetic"), some elevated diction clusters ("profound relief," "hallowed"), and occasional overwriting in atmospheric passages that slow key beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle on lighthouse keeper genre through ghost-as-predecessor maintaining duty. The anonymous letter chain spanning decades offers genuine originality. Some familiar ghost story beats prevent higher scoring.</comment>
