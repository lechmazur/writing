<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal contradiction between "gentle radical" philosophy and enforcement role creates genuine tension, with the retrocognitive vision forcing a decisive choice between orders and empathy. The final act of renaming shows earned transformation through specific cost—defying her lieutenant and risking her position—though some interior phrasing edges toward abstraction ("philosophy that felt increasingly like a paradox").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change when Elara refuses orders and renames the sector to protect the family, with visible cost in defying authority. The retrocognitive vision causally drives this transformation, and the piece teaches its speculative element early enough to integrate naturally. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the family's presence (they appear abruptly mid-story).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shattered sky with "fractures of impossible light" and soot-stained plaza create vivid post-apocalyptic atmosphere that constrains choices. The blue tessera against universal grey provides crucial contrast that triggers the plot turn. Setting actively shapes the ending when Elara uses the plaza's name as protective designation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from following orders to protecting human lives, with the tessera vision providing the tightening turn that forces Elara's choice. The lieutenant's hand on the shock-prod raises immediate physical threat, and Elara's defiance carries clear professional cost. One meaningful deepening that reweights her understanding of destruction versus creation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus erasure emerges through the tessera's embodied memory of creation contrasting with present destruction. The renaming from "Gamma-Seven" to "Tesera's Hold" offers non-literal answer to whether humanity can survive systematic dehumanization. Final image of sky fractures as "beginnings of a new mosaic" resonates without stating moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevated register ("clinical term for the grim work") fitting military context. Clean POV with selective perception focusing on significant details. Some filter-verb clustering in the vision sequence ("She was retrocognitively trapped") and occasional register elevation that strains ("aberrant mercy granting her a glimpse").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("cradle empathy in arms of steel"). Several instances of abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("wave of profound connection," "sacred weight of the moment"). Template cadence appears in places ("She looked... She walked... She stopped") though rhythm varies adequately overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The retrocognitive vision through touch offers fresh angle on post-apocalyptic military narrative. Specific detail of lapis lazuli tessera as memory vessel avoids generic rebellion plot. The paradox of "gentle radical" in armored enforcer role provides non-obvious character complexity, though execution occasionally relies on familiar dystopian beats.</comment>
