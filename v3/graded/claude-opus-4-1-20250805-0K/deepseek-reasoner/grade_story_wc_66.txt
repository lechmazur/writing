<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to teach dust to tell stories is concrete and particular, driving her actions throughout. The internal contradiction between her official duty and true work creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of her discovery method, though the final realization of becoming "conduit" rather than teacher lands with earned insight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the resonant reconfiguration where Elara discovers she must listen rather than teach. The closure lands with conceptual cost—she surrenders her original ambition to become something humbler. The "via elusive song lyrics" revelation provides the crucial turn that reweights her entire approach.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ember alcove with its mist-pressed window creates atmospheric pressure throughout. Sensory details like the "secretly luminous green" dial glow and dust "stirred from old books" ground the fantastical premise. The dust itself functions as micro-setting, constraining and enabling Elara's final discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving stories in a world that has banned them—intensifies through Elara's progression from passive listener to active translator. The escalation follows the accumulative lens as pressure builds through listening deeper until she hears the dust's own song. Cost is visible in her transformation from teacher to conduit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the progression from imposed silence to discovered song, with the dust carrying "memories trapped within microscopic fragments of pulverized literature." The final image of "the air itself remembering how to speak" resonantly answers the story famine without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Prose modulates effectively between the mundane (transcribing scores) and the magical (dust singing). Some register elevation in phrases like "systematically purged" and "seditious" that slightly exceed Elara's likely lexicon, though the overall voice maintains coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though several instances of template cadence ("She would then... Only then would she...") and some abstract phrasing ("thistled calm," "secretly luminous") that borders on overwriting. Information density is high and the final image resonates, but minor scaffold elements prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of dust carrying story-memories from destroyed books offers a fresh angle on censorship resistance. The transformation from teaching to listening inverts expectations meaningfully. The specific detail of "via elusive song lyrics" as the key creates an unexpected synthesis of music and narrative.</comment>
