<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict between preserving and discovering truth creates genuine tension, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously as she processes the journalist's question and her family legacy. The final choice to dismantle her inheritance is earned through prior discovery, though the emotional embodiment could be more visceral during the revelation scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear causal drive from journalist's question → logical exercise → discovery → action, with the proof by contradiction method creating a decisive change when Elara shifts from observer to actor. Closure lands with visible cost as she dismantles her inheritance "one truthful sentence at a time," though the cost could be more sharply felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains and enables key choices—the telescope becomes the instrument of truth-finding, the archival cabinets provide evidence, and the "echoing dome" reflects consequences. The rosewood pen nib transforms from comfort to accusation to tool of rebellion, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from preserving legacy → discovering truth → confronting fundamental betrayal, with the proof by contradiction tightening options until Elara must act. The discovery forecloses her path of "devotedly observant" keeper, though the middle investigation could show more visceral pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that "integrity" can be performance, with the observatory transforming from sanctuary to "monument to a curated falsehood." The ending offers a non-literal answer as writing becomes rebellion rather than preservation, though some phrasing edges toward abstraction ("personal solar system of regrets").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception (focusing on the pen nib's weight, the telescope's brass), though some passages drift into elevated register ("elliptical path of these past decisions as a physical pressure"). The POV remains stable with appropriate interiority for Elara's educated background.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("personal solar system of regrets," "gravitational tension") and some filter constructions ("she felt each elliptical path"). The final paragraph achieves strong momentum with concrete action verbs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The proof by contradiction method offers a fresh angle on the familiar trope of family legacy revelation, and the specific detail of cross-referencing ledgers with personal diaries grounds the discovery. However, the corrupt journalism premise is well-worn territory that needed more transformation.</comment>
