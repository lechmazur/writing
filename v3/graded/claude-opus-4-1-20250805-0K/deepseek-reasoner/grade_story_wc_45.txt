I'll evaluate this story under the **Hybrid lens** (Causal dominant at closure, with Accumulative/Textural elements throughout).

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's "forgiving skepticism" and "shrewd innocence" manifest through concrete actions—her willingness to heal the Fae despite its role in taking her child shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The bone-setting scene embodies her motivation to "turn mistakes into constellations" with visible cost (giving back the tooth). Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("failure of imagination") but the final choice is fully earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—Elara's departure with both child and silver blossom crystallizes a "wiser, more generous kind of knowing" with clear cost (the Fae's continued loss). The causal chain from discovery through healing to exchange is clean. Slight deduction for the overly neat thematic summary in the final paragraph ("constellation mapped from a terrible mistake").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The secret garden's "nostalgic innovation" with fireflies pulsing like heartbeats and silver blossoms creates strong atmosphere. The bone-setting sequence grounds us in tactile specificity ("delicate, alien architecture of its wrist"). However, the village and clearing lack sensory detail, and the hedge maze journey is compressed to mere "scraping branches."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (recovering her living child) drives clear escalation from discovery through the maze to the garden confrontation. The bone-setting creates meaningful complication—Elara must heal the being who took her son. Cost is visible in the Fae's permanent loss versus her recovery, though the resolution feels slightly too neat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "forgiving skepticism"—Elara's certainty "cleft cleanly in two" becomes "a bridge" by story's end. The changeling's tooth functions as a concrete symbol of failed becoming. Deduction for explicit thematic statement in the final paragraph that over-explains the constellation metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in moments like "The air hummed with a nostalgic innovation" and Elara's medical assessment of the Fae's injury. The Fae's voice "like rustling leaves" distinguishes it well. However, some register drift into elevated diction ("profound sorrow," "monstrously unfair") that doesn't fully match Elara's practical perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several issues: redundant phrasing ("yearned only for...yearned for"), abstract descriptors ("profound sorrow," "nostalgic innovation" used twice), and the final paragraph's excessive scaffolding that restates themes. The bone-setting sequence shows strong concrete detail that elevates the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The changeling-as-hawthorn-effigy offers a fresh take on the fairy tale tradition, and the bone-setting as bridge between worlds is inventive. However, the resolution follows predictable emotional beats, and the "turning mistakes into constellations" metaphor, while lovely, doesn't fully transform the familiar changeling narrative structure.</comment>
