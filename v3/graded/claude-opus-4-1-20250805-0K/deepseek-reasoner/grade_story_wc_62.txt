I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination**: This story operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens - the narrative builds through layered sensory details, symbolic accumulation (ribbon, butterflies, spectral presence), and a pattern-based revelation that reweights Elara's understanding of her craft. The closure arrives through density increase and cadence shift rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's characterization succeeds through embodied perception ("chisel whispered," "cool pressure on the back of her neck") and the concrete evolution from craftsperson to "humble, grateful scribe." The internal shift from seeking "the shape of collective grief" to understanding it as "dialogue" shows genuine transformation with visible cost - her entire conception of her work reweights.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively - Elara's understanding of grief transforms from void to "dialogue," with the conceptual cost visible in how she must now approach every stone differently. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the spectral guide's mechanics remain slightly vague, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting transcends decoration by enabling the story's central revelation - the butterfly migration creates the temporal/spatial conditions for the spectral encounter. Sensory layering ("nectar-scented air," "glass panes shimmered like dragonfly wings") directly serves the accumulative drive, and the environment constrains the revelation to this specific moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation manifests through deepening layers - from physical sensation to spectral guidance to witnessed memory to transformed understanding. The cost emerges in Elara's recognition that her work must now carry "fierce meditation," though the stakes could intensify more sharply.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of grief as "thundering calm" - not absence but presence, not silence but unspoken poetry. The family's ritual of trading poems becomes the story's thematic answer: collective grief takes the shape of continued dialogue, with the ribbon serving as visual poem marking each lost voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical control with strong perceptual signature ("golden dust of dusk," "living river flowing through broken panes"). The prose rhythm effectively modulates with emotional intensity, though occasional elevated diction ("immense, thundering calm") slightly strains the gravestone carver's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The ribbon's path, she realized, led to the old botanical conservatory"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("vibrant, decaying greenery") and minor repetition of "thundering calm" prevent higher scoring, but momentum remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving with spectral mentorship offers a fresh angle on grief narratives. The specific detail of the family's poetry ritual and the ribbon as visual poem elevates beyond template ghost stories, though the spectral guide concept itself follows somewhat familiar patterns.</comment>
