<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to decode the stranger's gesture is rooted in his isolation-born kinship, and his method of "observing gaps" drives consistent choices through to the final act of delivering the boutonnière. The character's internal consistency holds, though the emotional complexity could deepen during the discovery moment at the cottage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure: Elias delivers the boutonnière to its rightful home, completing the stranger's interrupted journey with visible cost ("leaving the decoded gesture to its silent, rightful home"). The pattern of gaps filling with meaning builds coherently to this Resonant Reconfiguration where the message finally reaches its recipient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal dock and persistent mist create a liminal atmosphere that mirrors the story's concern with gaps and isolation, while the Alpine flower's incongruity in this "damp, saline world" drives the investigation. The cottage's struggling Edelweiss patch provides the crucial environmental constraint that unlocks meaning, though more sensory detail during the discovery could heighten impact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from duty-bound investigation to personal mission as Elias follows the gaps from lifeboat to flower to coastline to cottage, with each discovery narrowing possibilities. The final delivery carries emotional weight, though the lack of active opposition means pressure accumulates through discovery rather than conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of connection across isolation emerges organically through the parallel between Elias and the stranger, culminating in the line "connecting the lonely to the lost." The concept of "borrowed memories" manifests beautifully as Elias reconstructs meaning from absences, with the delivered boutonnière serving as both literal completion and thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains elegant control with phrases like "world had shrunk to the circumference of the beacon's beam" and distinctive perceptual signatures like Elias "talking to gulls and charting tides by instinct." The prose modulates appropriately from meditative opening to urgent discovery, though occasional elevated diction ("perpetual witness") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in discovery sequences. Some minor redundancies appear ("muffling his footsteps, holding its breath" could be tighter), but information density remains high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of investigating through gaps rather than presence offers a fresh angle on the detective story, while the Alpine flower in a maritime setting creates memorable incongruity. The final revelation that the stranger was arriving rather than lost provides a meaningful reversal, though the resolution's tidiness slightly dampens the risk-taking.</comment>
