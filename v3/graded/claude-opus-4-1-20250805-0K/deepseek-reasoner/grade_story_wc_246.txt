I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages from Aris's failure through signal discovery to revelation and resolution.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment ("heart hammered against his ribs") and consistent trait expression of "confidently uncertain." The protagonist's transformation from despair to "quiet acceptance" is earned through specific discovery. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("privately drowning in doubt") that lacks in-scene contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear causal chain from failure→signal→discovery→resolution with visible cost (accepting uncertainty over certainty). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the pen's true purpose reframes both his mistake and mentor's foresight. Orientation anchored early with who/where/when established in opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly actively shapes the story through distortions that enable the signal and the pen's function as calibration tool. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("humming silence," "lights to flicker"). The exotic nib's perfect fit in the calibration port strains plausibility slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal failure through mysterious signal to revelation that recontextualizes everything. The protagonist's agency drives discovery and action (inserting the pen). Cost is visible in accepting uncertainty over false confidence, though the resolution feels slightly convenient with Elara's prescient planning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete action of "unbending" history—not erasing but recontextualizing error into purpose. The pen as tool for correction rather than creation resonates. Final image of "learning how to ask the right questions" avoids moralizing while offering genuine insight about knowledge and failure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("scrolling figures, seeing not physics but the ghost of his mistake"). Some register elevation in places ("contingent relationships," "recontextualizing") slightly exceeds the POV's established voice during crisis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("humming silence," "eerie recognition"). Minor template cadence in middle section ("The message was...," "It was...," "It suggested..."). Information density is strong with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly storing messages is fresh, as is the pen-as-key revelation. However, the mentor-anticipates-student's-crisis-perfectly trope is familiar. The recontextualization of failure as necessary process offers genuine insight but doesn't fully transform the redemption arc template.</comment>
