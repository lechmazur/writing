I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor for a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered revelations and sensory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the Statue's entire understanding reweights from tragedy to patient guardianship.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Statue's transformation from certainty to expanded understanding is earned through concrete particulars (342 pearls, phosphorescent kelp) and embodied perception shifts. The historian's "incisively kind" motivation manifests through careful, patient action rather than force. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient emotional arithmetic at the end, but the core arc from rigid observation to warm guardianship lands with genuine cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the Statue's foundational understanding shifts from tragedy to chosen preservation, with clear cost in releasing millennia of mourning. The cascading revelations structure works causally through ampoule → clasp → collective memory. The orientation anchors (underwater city garden, Statue, historian) establish cleanly within the first 100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The underwater garden functions as more than setting—the structural weakness, coralline moss, and 342 pearls all constrain or enable key choices. Exceptional sensory hierarchy with "crushing pressure" and "phosphorescent kelp" filtered through the Statue's stone perception. The fluted column's hidden niche exemplifies how environment shapes the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: certainty fissures → first movement in millennia → revelation of purposeful design. The dominant stake (understanding purpose vs. mere watching) tightens when the Statue must choose to reveal the column's weakness. Cost is legible in the weight shift from burden to blanket, though the resolution trends slightly neat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between watching and guardianship, between certainty as prison and nuanced understanding as freedom. The 342 pearls transform from debris to constellation map without stating the moral. The final image of "faithfully remembered" resonates beyond plot, though "warm current in cold water" edges toward convenient symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signatures between the Statue's "monochrome telepathy" and the historian's "scream of color" create strong voice contrast. The Statue's voice as "low grind of continental plates" fits perfectly. Deduction for occasional register elevation ("incisively kind," "cascading revelations") that doesn't fully match the POV's ancient simplicity, and some filter-verb accumulation in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("crushing pressure of the forgotten underwater city garden"). However, template cadence appears in the revelation sequence ("It was not...It saw...The three hundred and forty-two pearls were not..."). Some paraphrase loops around the certainty/revelation cycle. The "tone animate lifeless" construction feels forced rather than organic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathic statue with underwater preservation narrative avoids easy tragedy. The specific detail of 342 pearls as navigation constellation shows originality. The transformation of watching into guardianship through chemical memory is non-obvious. Slight deduction for the somewhat familiar "sleeping civilization" trope, though it's elevated by specific execution.</comment>
