I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and sensory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action—her "lucidly watchful grace" manifests in the delicate sifting of psychic residue. The geomancer exists primarily as object rather than character, but Elara's internal state shows genuine complexity in "weary and hollowed out, but at peace." Minor deduction for the geomancer lacking dimension beyond his function.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the captured memory transforms both the corpse (ghost of a smile) and Elara (finding sustaining stillness). The cost is visible in Elara being "hollowed out" and the emerald turning "dull, opaque grey." The accumulative structure coheres well, though the orientation could anchor "who" slightly earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto setting directly enables the work through its "resonant quiet" and aurora light that plays across the gem's surface. Setting constrains the ritual through required stillness and charges the final image with the "radiant hush" deepening. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing the spark before oblivion—is clear and tightens through the gradual extraction process. Escalation reads as density increase from "green noise" to "pattern emerged" to final infusion. Cost is legible in the emerald's depletion and Elara's exhaustion, though the lack of genuine opposition or complication keeps this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the preservation of joy against oblivion without explicit moralizing. The boy's memory of finding the emerald offers a resonant answer to mortality through specificity. The final image of the "banked fire" within the corpse reweights the opening's "beautician to the dead" with earned meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "memory of sound" and "distant rumor." Voice maintains lyrical elevation consistently, with controlled rhythm that modulates during the extraction sequence. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("atomic lattice," "tectonic plates") that slightly strains the mystical-professional balance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose shows high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"crystalline mouth opened to the endless heavens" establishes setting, tone, and otherworldliness simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak moments ("breathing rhythm," "banked fire") but coherent within the lyric mode. Clean of loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of extracting consciousness from minerals offers a fresh angle on death-work. The specific synthesis of beautician/mortician with psychic archaeology feels non-obvious. The geomancer's joy being his childhood discovery of the same emerald adds unexpected circularity that feels earned rather than convenient.</comment>
