<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's pacifist motivation against her violent heritage creates genuine internal tension, particularly in her method of "inculcating plants with values" as quiet rebellion. The soldier's transformation from panic to stillness demonstrates earned change through Elara's specific intervention. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("senselessly perceptive dread") and the soldier's emotional shift feeling slightly accelerated given the brief encounter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the soldier's acceptance of stillness and Elara's "good harvest" reweight the opening's isolation into productive connection. Cost is visible in the soldier's surrender of his weapon and warrior identity. Deduction for slightly rushed pacing in the soldier's arrival and transformation sequence, though the thematic throughline of "weaving continuity through chaos" lands effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass dome setting constrains and enables key choices—its "perfumed, engineered tranquility" contrasts the outside chaos and works upon the soldier to enable his transformation. Strong sensory detail in "crunch of grit," "irrigated mist," and the rose's "tranquil blaze." Minor deduction for some abstract descriptors ("shimmering, silent haze") and limited physical grounding of the soldier's entry through the compromised airlock.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of maintaining sanctuary/peace against intrusion escalates through the soldier's violent arrival to his eventual surrender. The energy blade's deactivation marks clear de-escalation with cost—his "surrender, not to her, but to the atmosphere." Limited by single-beat escalation structure and the soldier's relatively quick capitulation, though this fits the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of cultivating peace through patient accumulation emerges organically from Elara's literal plant cultivation extending to human rehabilitation. The bone sliver "quiet" gains resonance when enacted through the soldier's transformation. Strong thematic coherence between inherited violence (father/soldier) and chosen peace (Elara/roses), with the final "good harvest" reweighting all prior cultivation metaphors.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signature—Elara experiences absence "like a missing tooth with her tongue." Voice modulates appropriately from meditative opening to tense confrontation to calm instruction. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("There is no place for it here"). Minor deduction for some elevated diction ("inculcating") that occasionally strains against the pastoral setting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts marking tension changes. Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("senselessly perceptive dread," "malevolent blue light"), some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete, and minor redundancy in explaining the bone slivers' purpose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with botanical pacifism creates non-obvious angle on familiar "sanctuary invaded" trope. The specific method of "inculcating plants with values" through carved bone slivers offers genuine originality. The transformation of military hardware (energy blade) into surrender through floral pedagogy avoids expected confrontation patterns.</comment>
