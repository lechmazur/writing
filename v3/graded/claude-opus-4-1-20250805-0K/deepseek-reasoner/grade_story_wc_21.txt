I'll evaluate this story under a **Causal lens** with elements of Accumulative/Textural design, as the narrative follows clear because/therefore linkages while building atmospheric density toward its closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation as scholar-archivist drives consistent choices through retrocognitive trap to beach confrontation, with internal conflict between scholarly duty and visceral connection to Elara's trauma. The final covenant shows earned transformation through specific experience. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("solemn duty now a sacred covenant") rather than fully embodied state at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from diary discovery through retrocognitive trap to obsidian lagoon revelation, with Resonant Reconfiguration closure where understanding replaces force. Cost is visible in Elias's transformation from detached archivist to covenant-keeper. The spectral guardian's dissipation and truth's integration show clear before/after with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Floating library and obsidian lagoon create distinctive settings that constrain choices—the lagoon's non-reflective surface hiding truth becomes key to resolution. Beach debris becomes tools for communication. Deduction for some generic descriptors ("bleached coin in a white sky") and setting details that don't always pressure immediate choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from scholarly curiosity through bodily possession to confrontation with trauma's guardian, with each phase narrowing options. The shift from potential violence to dialogue-through-debris shows meaningful tactical adjustment. Cost visible in Elias's permanent alteration from "solemn duty" to "sacred covenant."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus myth emerges through concrete actions—arranging debris messages, the lagoon revealing hidden history, the spectral guardian as testimony rather than threat. Final image of zeppelin carrying "complete, searing truth" resonates without stating moral. The tension between official story and hidden truth drives thematic complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevation ("pressurized hush," "quiet thunderclap") that occasionally strains POV lexicon. Strong perceptual signature in how Elias notices archival details. Some register drift toward overly literary diction ("testament ratified by the land itself") that doesn't fully match character's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some overwriting in figurative language ("sun a bleached coin in a white sky"). Information density high in discovery and confrontation scenes. Deductions for occasional elevated diction that creates distance and some redundancy in emotional labeling versus embodiment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival research with supernatural retrocognition and environmental puzzle-solving. The obsidian lagoon as natural surveillance countermeasure shows inventive world-building. Beach debris as communication method offers non-obvious solution. Some familiar beats in spectral guardian confrontation prevent higher score.</comment>
