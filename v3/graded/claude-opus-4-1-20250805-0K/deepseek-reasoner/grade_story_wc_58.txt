<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling—mapping the geography of healing through chronicling loss. The internal transformation from understanding healing as moving beyond grief to recognizing it as woven integration shows genuine character evolution with visible cost. Minor deduction for Isolde's relatively static presence despite being central to the conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the thread revelation reweights the entire premise of loss and presence. The cost is felt through Isolde's decades of carrying absence and Elara's transformed understanding of her work's purpose. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words with who (Elara), where (island garden/palace), and when (after ships sailed).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The thread constrains and enables the central choice—it becomes the physical mechanism through which Elara experiences the geography of healing. Setting details (shadowed garden, crumbling palace, faded carpet) all pressure the exploration of loss and memory. The carpet's geography directly mirrors the story's thematic concern with mapping healing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding how people live with loss—deepens through the thread's revelation, transforming from observing grief to experiencing presence-in-absence. The escalation from shared silence to physical communion with memory shows clear tightening. Cost is legible in Isolde's decades of endurance and Elara's reconfigured purpose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of weaving—loss integrated into continuing life's fabric. The thread as "tiny, perfect compass" offers a resonant non-literal answer to the geography of healing question. No explicit moralizing; the insight about healing's true geography arises from concrete sensory experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with lyrical precision ("dry leaves skittering on stone," "thin, gold veneer"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance that deepens during the thread revelation. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "intimate communion") that slightly exceeds the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deductions for filter-verb clustering ("she felt a shift," "She could smell," "Elara felt") and some register drift into academic abstraction ("geography of healing," "intimate communion").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of obituary-writing with presence-projection creates an original angle on grief narratives. The concept of writing obituaries for the living while mapping healing geography offers genuine novelty. The thread-as-memory-conduit provides specific transformation of the textile/weaving trope.</comment>
