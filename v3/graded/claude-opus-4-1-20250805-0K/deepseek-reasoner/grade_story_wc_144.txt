I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages from problem identification through diagnostic process to solution.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's blindness as lens for perception is distinctive and well-embodied through tactile navigation and sonic awareness. Her motivation is immediately clear and the micro-choices (water immersion, listening to frequencies, laying the gold wire) reveal competence balanced with genuine struggle. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution timing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change with the drone's successful repair and departure, showing clear cost in the three-hour deadline pressure. Causal chain from diagnosis through water refraction to bypass solution is solid. Deduction for the somewhat mechanical resolution that lacks deeper emotional or thematic cost beyond professional success.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The repair shop corner and rail depot establish atmosphere effectively, with sensory detail particularly strong in Elara's non-visual perception. The water bowl and light refraction create a micro-setting that directly constrains the solution. Some generic descriptors ("vast, mist-coated") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are immediately clear with the three-hour deadline and the ship's dependency on the guidance core. Escalation works through diagnostic discovery - from external examination to water immersion to understanding the overflow problem. The ticking clock maintains pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of perception beyond sight emerges organically through Elara's diagnostic process. The idea that broken things have a "true nature" accessible through alternative sensing resonates but doesn't fully develop beyond the mechanical repair. The ending focuses on plot resolution rather than thematic deepening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close third-person with effective filtering through Elara's non-visual perception. Distinctive touches like "a map of sound and pressure" and "topography she navigated with her fingertips" establish perceptual signature. Some elevated diction ("mimetic engineering") fits the technical context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with good momentum through the diagnostic sequence. Information density is solid with most sentences advancing plot or atmosphere. Some overwriting in metaphorical descriptions ("iron belly of the city") and occasional redundancy in explaining the drone's function.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The blind repair expert who perceives through alternative senses offers a fresh angle on the diagnostic story. The specific solution of using water refraction to understand the drone's malfunction shows ingenuity. The integration of sensory limitation as expertise rather than handicap transforms the expected dynamic.</comment>
