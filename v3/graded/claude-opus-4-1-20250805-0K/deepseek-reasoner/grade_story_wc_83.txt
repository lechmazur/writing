I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and sensory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara discovers the pool of preserved potential.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a trauma survivor hunting for "unused potential pools" is viscerally embodied through the milky eye and wedding memory. The geode-enabled search shows concrete agency, and her transformation from revenge to "cold mathematician's thrill" earns the final stance. Minor deduction for slightly abstract conceptualization of what she seeks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and memory fragments build toward Elara's discovery of K-7B, a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost ("joy had died with her bride"). The power cycle creates temporal pressure that enables her hunt. Slight abstractness in the "unused potential pools" concept prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory setting directly enables the hunt through its sensor arrays and power cycles, while zero-g choreography grounds every movement. The geode as micro-setting constrains her method of searching. The K-7B discovery wouldn't exist without this specific environment above Earth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal trauma through the timed window of the power cycle to the cosmic discovery of K-7B. The pressure coheres well under the Accumulative lens, building density through sensory layering. Cost is visible in her transformation but the abstract nature of "potential pools" slightly dampens the visceral impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation of trauma into purposeful seeking, with the universe revealed as neutral rather than malicious. The final image of learning "how to drink" from the pool resonates without moralizing. The wedding memory's transformation from loss to amplified hope creates genuine thematic depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled scientific register ("perturbation theory of death") that modulates into lyric intensity during the hunt sequence. The perceptual signature of seeing through both physical and traumatic lenses is consistently maintained. Clean free indirect style throughout with purposeful compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the opening's compression of backstory and characterization. Clean syntax variation and momentum throughout. Minor deduction for slight abstraction around "intangibly tangible" and one instance of elevated diction ("scoured her soul").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The wedding-survivor-turned-cosmic-hunter premise offers fresh synthesis, particularly the use of trauma as a dowsing mechanism for universal potential. The perturbation theory metaphor transforms grief uniquely. Some conceptual abstraction around what exactly these "pools" are prevents full originality.</comment>
