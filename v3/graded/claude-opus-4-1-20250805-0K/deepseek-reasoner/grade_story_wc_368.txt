I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Identification**: This is an **Accumulative/Textural** piece. The story builds through layered imagery and metaphor (sun trails, light-as-dye, the morpho wing) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara understands her new role as a "prism" for the donor's stories.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through the foreign heartbeat, with genuine internal conflict between her desire to understand and her discomfort with hosting another's experiences. The dye master functions effectively as pressure through demonstration rather than dialogue. The final realization that she must "listen to the one now beating inside her" represents earned character growth with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's understanding shifts from wanting to "magnetize stories" to recognizing herself as a "prism" that fractures light into unique colors. The accumulative lens holds consistently through light/color imagery building to the final insight. Cost is felt in the "jarring and profoundly affirming" heartbeat and the acceptance of hosting another's experiences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating tea house setting directly constrains the intimate encounter, while the valley-mist creates atmospheric pressure. The morpho wing becomes setting-as-object, its microscopic structures revealed through the dye master's technique. The sun trails method transforms light into a tangible environmental element that shapes the central demonstration and charges the final image of interconnected refractions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on Elara's need to understand her changed relationship to stories. The dye master's demonstration creates escalating pressure through the revelation that stories "came with the heart." The deepening occurs through the wing transformation sequence, with cost visible in Elara's physical response ("sudden, solid thump") and the weight of understanding she now carries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the light/prism metaphor without explicit moralizing. The concept that "every life is a prism" that "fractures a single light into ten thousand unique colours" resonates beyond the immediate situation. The final image of interconnected sun trails reweights the entire piece, offering a non-literal answer about human connection and story transmission.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary elevation with distinctive perceptual signature ("silence...was a living thing," "quietly explosive"). The dye master's sparse dialogue carries appropriate weight and subtext. POV remains stable with Elara throughout, with controlled psychic distance that tightens during the revelation sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control but suffers from occasional overwriting ("valley-mist wonder," "iridescent caution a silent sermon"). Some metaphor density in peak beats ("quietly explosive with contained potential, like a seed cracking open underground") slows momentum. However, the sun trails imagery maintains coherence and the final paragraph achieves clean propulsion without loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of inheriting stories through organ donation offers fresh angle on familiar transplant narrative. The dye master's technique of "drawing with pure illumination" provides original concrete manifestation of abstract concept. The synthesis of medical, artistic, and metaphysical elements feels organic rather than forced, though some prompt-required elements create slight awkwardness.</comment>
