<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses throughout—Elara's melancholy versus her sudden desire to connect, Leo's despair versus his synesthetic curiosity. The final choice (Leo anchoring Elara with his touch) feels earned through their parallel grief experiences. Minor deduction for some diagnostic language ("fractured timeline," "spectral core") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's release transforms from endless repetition to acknowledged completion, with visible cost (her fading). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory echoes build toward connection. Orientation anchors establish quickly (hedge maze, after closing, ghost and visitor).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synesthetic translations effectively make setting active—music becoming "silver and blue threads," rope manifesting as hemp scent and copper taste. The tarot coin constrains the final choice. Some generic descriptors ("mystic orchard," "twilight realm") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through intensifying sensory echoes that culminate in Leo experiencing Elara's death moment. The cost is legible—Elara's form dissolving after finally being witnessed. One meaningful deepening as Leo understands he's experiencing trapped memory, not random haunting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ending reweights the entire story—Elara's "encore" comes not through performance but connection, transforming repetition into resolution. The Fool/Tower tarot imagery subtly frames the journey/catastrophe duality without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signatures—Leo's synesthetic translations, Elara's theatrical framing. Some elevated diction ("fractured timeline," "spectral core") creates minor register drift but doesn't obscure closure. Clean POV management with clear focal shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some abstract phrasing ("fractured timeline," "ancient grief," "pull of possibility") and repetitive constructions ("She was...," "He was...") in the opening. Strong closing image. Minor template cadence in middle sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Synesthesia as ghost-communication mechanism offers fresh angle on haunting trope. The specific synthesis—sensory translation bridging living/dead—feels inevitable once established. Risk-taking in making connection non-verbal pays off.</comment>
