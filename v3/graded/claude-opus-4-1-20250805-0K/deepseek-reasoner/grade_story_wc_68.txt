<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's obsessive preservation drive and Elara's pragmatic dismissal create genuine tension, with his final choice to selectively reveal truth showing meaningful internal conflict. The "abrasive calm" and "sandpaper serenity" effectively embody his isolation-worn personality, though Elara remains somewhat functional rather than fully realized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds as Silas's discovery of the data slate forces him to choose between destructive truth and useful myth, landing on a compromise that preserves both knowledge and social stability. The closure shows clear cost—he sacrifices his pure truth-seeking for pragmatic teaching—though the final transformation could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underwater chamber accessed through "sedimentary layers of silt" creates genuine constraint, with the chronometer cog and fossilized data slate serving as tactile anchors. The geological metaphor of time layered in stone reinforces theme, though some descriptive passages lean generic ("damp air").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The competing narratives create clear stakes—preserve complex truth vs. maintain simple stability—with Silas's discovery escalating the dilemma. His choice to transform conflict into teaching method shows agency, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily without testing his commitment through greater resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The central question of whether knowledge preservation justifies potential social fracture emerges organically through the data slate discovery and competing interpretations. The chronometer transforming from relic to teaching tool elegantly reweights the preservation theme, showing wisdom lies in application rather than hoarding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Silas's philosophical voice ("Fools and ghosts are often the only ones who remember") contrasts effectively with Elara's pragmatic directness. The narrative maintains consistent close-third perspective with controlled psychic distance, though some passages drift toward explanatory rather than embodied ("His rebellion was rational, not radical").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with moments of elegance ("library of the sunken city," "sandpaper serenity"), though some scaffolding appears ("He agonized over the weight of it"). Information density is generally strong, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The post-plague philosopher-librarian in underwater ruins offers a fresh angle on knowledge preservation, avoiding simple dystopian tropes. The competing narratives concept and Silas's choice to teach through tools rather than facts shows thoughtful engagement, though the resolution feels somewhat safe.</comment>
