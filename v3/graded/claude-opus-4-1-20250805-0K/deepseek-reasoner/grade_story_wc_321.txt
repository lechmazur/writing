Looking at this story through a demanding editorial lens for immediate publishability:

**Drive Lens**: Causal - the story operates through clear because/therefore linkages as Leo discovers the temporal anomaly, follows radio coordinates, and resolves the crisis through deliberate action.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Leo's motivation crystallizes naturally from bewilderment to purposeful action ("he understood then...that his motivation was to merge these parallel timelines"). His resilient positivity becomes a functional compass rather than mere trait, though internal contradiction could deepen. The final choice to turn the hourglass carries earned weight from prior discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from clock anomaly through passenger dissolution to grotto discovery and timeline restoration. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost ("forever the ardent keeper of the timeline he had made whole"). The hourglass transformation from empty to sideways-flowing to normal creates clear before/after. Minor dock for convenience of perfect-fit pedestal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ferry deck and spectral grotto create distinct atmospheric pressure. "Walls shimmered with echoes of the Evening Star from other days" effectively uses setting as temporal mirror. The grotto's "starlight that did not come from any sky he knew" establishes otherworldly stakes. Environment constrains choice through the pedestal's specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from personal disorientation to reality fracture to active restoration. The radio's temporal chaos ("his own voice, moments old; a woman's voice from a day ago") raises pressure effectively. Leo's agency drives resolution through deliberate action. Cost manifests in his transformed understanding and permanent burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of synchronicity versus fragmentation emerges through concrete images (sideways clocks, overlapping transmissions, merged timelines). The hourglass's transformation from empty to sideways to normal elegantly embodies temporal healing. Final image of Leo as "ardent keeper" reweights his initial role with earned depth, though could resist explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent maritime competence ("grabbed the marine radio," "steering the ghost ship"). Perceptual signature strong in crisis moments ("thick, unnatural fog coiled"). Brief dialogue serves function well. Minor slip in abstract understanding ("not through logic but through a deep, instinctual pull") could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation. "The sand within it reappeared, not falling down, but flowing sideways" creates visual precision. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("frayed threads of reality," "spectral grotto," "alien starlight"). Template phrasing in "He understood then" and filter-heavy "He refused to see."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry setting with time-fracture concept. The sideways-flowing hourglass sand as temporal embodiment shows genuine invention. Radio voices from multiple timelines creates original pressure mechanism. Transformation of mundane commute into cosmic repair elevates familiar material, though grotto convenience slightly diminishes risk.</comment>
