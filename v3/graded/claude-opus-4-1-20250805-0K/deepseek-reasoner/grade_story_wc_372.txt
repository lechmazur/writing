I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered discoveries toward a conceptual repricing about the nature of preservation itself.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Archivist's motivation is crystal clear and his meticulous nature drives specific actions throughout. His internal shift from measuring decay to seeking eternal truths is earned through concrete discovery. Minor deduction for slightly abstract emotional states ("heart a heavy weight") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure building from routine measurement through discovery to reconceptualization. The closure achieves a genuine Conceptual Repricing as the Archivist realizes he's been "measuring the wrong thing" - the cost is his entire previous methodology becoming obsolete. The pattern of sampling slides teaches the reader the archive's logic early and pays off when the luminous vow breaks that pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The frozen library setting is vivid and constrains action through its crystalline architecture and the fragility of the slides. Sensory details like "soft crunch of his boots on the frost-veined floor" and "glass edge cold against his skin" ground us physically. The setting directly enables the discovery and shapes how the Archivist must work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from measuring individual slides to confronting the archive's systemic decay to discovering a new paradigm of preservation. The pressure coheres through accumulation - each failing slide deepens the crisis until the luminous vow forces a complete reconceptualization. Cost is visible in abandoning his previous work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between fading memories and eternal truths. The luminous vows embody the theme without stating it - promises that literally glow with permanence versus memories that fade. The final image of "building a new constellation from the most enduring human truths" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formality matching the Archivist's meticulous nature. Perceptual signature strong in how he notices technical details ("brass dials," "resonance needle"). Some elevated diction ("cathedral of ice and knowledge") fits the mythic setting though occasionally edges toward purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting in metaphorical density ("keeper of ghosts, a preserver of whispers"). Minor template cadence in "He selected... He removed it... He slotted it" sequence. Strong information density overall with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archive/library trope with magic lantern technology and the concept of measuring emotional resonance. The distinction between recording memories versus capturing essence itself is conceptually innovative. The specific detail of luminous vows as literal light-weaving elevates familiar material.</comment>
