<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to crystallize fleeting emotion before it evaporates drives every choice, with the child's sneeze forcing acceptance that witnessing matters more than preservation. The internal contradiction between providing safety's mirage to others while never affording it to herself creates genuine complexity. Minor deduction for the gallery patrons remaining somewhat functional rather than applying direct pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through ritual dusting, the chair's final stillness, and dissolution into "uniform dust." The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with clear cost: Elara's art vanishes but transforms into "sacred, temporary grace," foreclosing permanence while affirming witness. The piece teaches its pattern early (fragility of carbon dust medium) and pays it off when the sneeze destroys yet fulfills the work's true purpose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gallery's "thick and expectant" silence, the perpetual rocking chair that finally stills, and the porcelain mask's "jagged openings" all constrain Elara's ritual. The mask functions as micro-setting, its shattered-and-gilded structure mirroring the art's fragility. Setting actively shapes the final dissolution when gallery light illuminates the dancing particles.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from capturing "profound quiet" through the ritual's "delicate balance" where "one errant breath could undo everything," to the child's sneeze that destroys yet paradoxically completes the work. The cost is unmistakable: the portrait dissolves, but this loss reveals art's true purpose as witness rather than preservation. Under the Accumulative lens, density builds through stillness, ritual precision, then explosive dissolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the porcelain mask's "shattered fragments painstakingly glued back together" mirroring how we reassemble meaning from loss. The "mirage of safety" that art offers—making pain beautiful through distance—resonates without explicit moralizing. The final image of dust settling on the stilled rocker offers a non-literal answer: grace lies in temporary witness, not permanent capture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "carbon dust of incinerated memories" and "crystallize a fleeting emotion." Voice maintains control through the destruction, shifting from careful precision to acceptance: "She did not startle or weep." Minor deduction for slight register elevation in "sacred, temporary grace" that briefly exceeds established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "brittle, terrifyingly beautiful mask" conveys fragility, danger, and allure simultaneously. Some template cadence in "They saw... They whispered... They did not know" sequence. Final paragraph's "simpler, starker truth" edges toward summary but recovers through the concrete image of dust on the rockers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The portrait-as-ash concept offers fresh inflection on memory preservation, with the child's sneeze as perfectly inevitable accident that reveals art's impermanence. The specific synthesis of charcoal portraiture with grief ritual feels earned. Slight derivative element in the "art as temporary witness" resolution, though executed with strong particularity.</comment>
