I'll evaluate this story under a Causal drive lens, as the narrative follows clear because/therefore linkages from the blackout through Kael's inventive response to the final revelation of printed truth.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits—his watchfulness transforms into calculated action against the Luminary's greed. The internal conflict between duty and higher fidelity plays out through concrete choices, particularly his decision to divert power to the presses rather than restore general lighting. Minor deduction for the somewhat abrupt revelation of his months-long observation of the Luminary's hoarding, which could have been more organically woven.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong causal structure with clear because/therefore linkages: blackout leads to Kael's investigation, which reveals the Luminary's greed, prompting his diversion of power to the presses. The closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration—the manifests printing truth while Kael returns to his post—with visible cost in the risk taken and path chosen. The "cradle of sparks" ember waiting for the next sentinel effectively crystallizes the changed state.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The luminous fort setting with its sun-stones and light-conduits directly constrains Kael's choices and enables his solution. The half-painted sundial's coded angles function as more than decoration—they're essential to solving the problem. The bronze quill holder's specific alloy completing a circuit shows strong integration of object properties with plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing the Luminary's greed versus maintaining order—escalates through Kael's choices. His decision to bypass main lines and power only the presses represents a meaningful tightening that forecloses his return to simple duty. The cost is legible in the risk of discovery and the irreversible nature of the printed manifests.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between hoarded light and shared darkness, with the printing presses as instruments of illumination beyond the literal. The final image of the ember as "cradle of sparks" resonantly answers the question of systemic change without stating a moral. The "winking hush" between Kael and the scribe embodies the theme of quiet revolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled diction ("dimming but a deepening," "arrest, a silence") that maintains consistency. The POV's selective attention to technical details reflects Kael's sentinel expertise. Some filter constructions ("he saw," "he reached") could be more immediate, and occasional elevated diction ("profound and unexplained blackout") slightly strains the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some instances of elevated diction ("profound and unexplained blackout," "lavish chambers") and occasional redundancy ("massive slab of ironoak banded with steel"). The phrase "calmly inventive" feels somewhat forced as a descriptor. Information density is strong in action sequences but occasionally lapses into slight overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh angle on the sentinel-as-revolutionary concept, with the bronze quill holder's dual function as both literacy marker and technical tool showing ingenuity. The half-painted sundial as intentional cipher rather than abandoned art is clever. The quiet revolution through printing rather than violence offers a non-obvious resolution to the power struggle.</comment>
