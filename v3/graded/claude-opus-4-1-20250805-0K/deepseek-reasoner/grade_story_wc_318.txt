<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied grief through specific actions (conducting leaf blower, covered in colorful dust) and the contradictory "mournfully eager" state drives authentic emotional complexity. The wife's progression from silence to wet giggle to healing laughter earns the character change through witnessed absurdity rather than declaration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration: the wife's laughter transforms from lost to "new, real sound, weathered and healing." Cost is visible in the "ragged" quality and years of silence broken. The hourglass-to-present structure anchors immediately, and the symbolic leaf-maceration accumulates meaning that pays off when she witnesses his "ridiculous love."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel functions as more than setting—it multiplies and transforms sound into "true haunting" that shapes the protagonist's method. Sensory detail of "crimson, gold, ochre" leaves becoming "colorful mist" creates visceral texture. The tunnel's acoustic properties enable the core action of sound-restoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from mechanical action to emotional breakthrough as the leaf blower's "dissonant chord" builds through "spectral lullabies" to the wife's appearance and laughter. The dominant stake (restoring joy) tightens when her giggle threads through the din, forcing him to kill the engine and face the present.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of using mechanical noise to resurrect human sound—"speaking through the wind" what cannot be voiced. The final image of walking "through the macerated past, into the present" resonantly answers the central question of how grief transforms without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature in "conductor" framing and musical language ("dissonant chord," "off-key wind," "counter-melody") that maintains coherence under pressure. The controlled lyricism ("pages from a forgotten calendar") serves the accumulative mode without obscuring action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths matching emotional intensity ("He yanked the cord" vs. flowing descriptions). Some elevated diction ("macerate," "spectral") occasionally strains but doesn't harm closure. Information density high—most lines advance both action and emotional state.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-work through leaf blower symphony in an echo chamber—specific and non-obvious. The transformation of yard work into musical resurrection feels earned through accumulated detail. Risk-taking in the absurdist premise heightens emotional stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
