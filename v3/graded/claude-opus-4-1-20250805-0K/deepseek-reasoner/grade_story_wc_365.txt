<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes sharply when touching the shard—from professional curiosity to desperate need to uncover the withheld truth. The man's simple human failure carries genuine weight, and Elara's final notation shows earned change. Minor deduction for the man's somewhat convenient presence in the final universe.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the cyclical jumps through universes accumulate toward the final revelation, with the green shard anchoring each shift. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara adds the green sigil—a small but meaningful change showing how the discovered truth has altered her mapmaking. Cost is visible in the man's decades of regret and Elara's new burden of knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The repair bay's sensory details—rust, ozone, broken conduits—effectively establish the desolate atmosphere. The green shard functions as micro-setting that constrains Elara's journey and charges the final image. Setting shapes the discovery but could more actively pressure choices in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional task to personal obsession as Elara experiences the "profound, aching regret" and becomes tied to the truth. The cyclical jumps show persistence under the accumulative lens, though the middle universes could apply more pressure. The final confrontation delivers emotional cost through the man's decades of carrying his failure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of mapping emotional residue versus discovering human truth. The green sigil in Elara's final notation resonates as a non-literal answer about "the silent dockyards of the heart." The simple, avoidable nature of the lie amplifies its thematic weight about human failure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent texture through phrases like "cavernous graveyard of starship skeletons" and "weaving between worlds of memory and matter." POV stays cleanly with Elara throughout the universe-hopping. The man's dialogue feels authentic with "It never gets easier, does it? The knowing."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and evocative descriptions like "phantom scent of ozone" and "sharp tang of fear." Information density is high throughout. Minor deductions for slight overwriting in places ("profound, aching regret") and one instance of tell over show ("The weight of it was immense").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of a sensory cartographer mapping psychic residue offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of memory-mapping with universe-hopping through a glass shard feels specific and earned. The final truth being "simple, stupid" yet devastating subverts expectations effectively.</comment>
