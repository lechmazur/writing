I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern, metaphor, and resonance rather than strict causality. The echo metaphor accumulates meaning through progressive disclosure until the final reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is crystalline and character-specific, with embodied perception ("vibrated in her teeth") and clear internal logic driving her quest. The merchant's hollow echo festering into greed provides strong characterological causality. Minor deduction for the merchant's slightly convenient confession, but the cost of his hollowness lands viscerally.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration - the final revelation about why people echo ("clarity of soul") reweights all prior material with clear conceptual cost (the merchant's permanent hollowness). The accumulative lens holds throughout with progressive disclosure structuring the journey. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canyon-as-acoustic-space brilliantly constrains choices throughout - from echo-singing to the serpentine nexus to the amphitheater's resonance. "The canyon at night was a different world, a negative of its sun-bleached daytime self" exemplifies purposeful sensory work. Setting actively shapes both method and resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through progressive disclosure with each shell whisper narrowing Lyra's path toward confrontation. The dominant stake (protecting the canyon's resonance) faces genuine threat. Cost is visible in the merchant's final hollowness and the returned echoes streaming away "like mist."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the echo metaphor without stating its moral - "it is not a trick of acoustics, but a clarity of soul" reweights everything. The seashell in the desert canyon creates productive tension. Final image of Lyra walking home as "the universe continued its ancient, humming song" offers perfect non-literal resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout - Lyra reads truth through sound's decay, the merchant flickers "like a mirage." "Reed-blown melancholy" and "the universe hummed its secret song" show controlled lyricism. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in philosophical moments ("festered into a bitter greed").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Her journey was guided through progressive disclosure"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("the particular pitch of the cosmic hum") but doesn't obscure meaning. "Soulsong" and similar coinages work within the established voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The echo-as-soul concept transforms a familiar phenomenon through specific mechanics - stolen echoes sold "to the silent ones of the world." The seashell's progressive disclosure structure feels fresh. The merchant's hollow echo as character flaw turned to greed shows conceptual integrity.</comment>
