<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent—to ease traumatic memories—with embodied contradictions shown through his physical absorption of the lord's remorse ("a new stone in his gut"). The boy's vacancy and Elara's grief-contagion create genuine pressure. Minor deduction for the boy lacking distinct characterization beyond his trapped state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with closure landing as Resonant Reconfiguration—Kaelen absorbs the lord's remorse to free the boy, with explicit cost ("made his own that much rougher"). The tidal pool analysis building to the coral's transformation creates clear escalation. Orientation anchors (desert fortress, Elara, underground cavern) establish cleanly by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The coral pavilion functions as micro-setting that directly constrains choice—Kaelen cannot simply enter without being consumed. Sensory detail filters through his chef-of-memory POV ("tasting the memory of the storm"). The tidal pool's "language" of ripples meaningfully guides his technique, making environment essential to resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Elara's plea through Kaelen's analysis to his brutal absorption of the lord's memory. The dominant stake—saving the boy from centuries-old remorse—tightens when Kaelen must internalize the trauma himself. Cost is unmistakable: "His body shook with the effort, his own mind a battlefield."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the coral pavilion's dual nature—a gift of love that became a prison—without explicit moralizing. The ending reweights Kaelen's profession: he smooths memories for others by roughening his own. Minor deduction for "sandpapering" appearing too literally in both opening and closing, slightly over-telegraphing the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through taste-as-memory ("sharp, electric tang of ozone and a deeper, more complex flavor"). Voice maintains consistency through pressure, with syntax appropriately fragmenting during the absorption scene. Slight deduction for "emotionally contagious" feeling like prompt-language rather than organic voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong sensory precision ("sun-warmed stone," "crystalline frost") with varied syntax. However, "sandpapering rough memories" appears verbatim three times, and "emotionally contagious" reads as template language. The phrase "sturdy brittle" lacks clear meaning. Information density remains high with purposeful paragraph variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chef-who-tastes-memories concept transforms the rescue narrative through specific mechanics (tidal pool analysis, oils of forgetfulness). The coral pavilion as frozen sea-monument for a homesick wife offers genuine emotional complexity. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and memory-absorption mechanics elevates stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
