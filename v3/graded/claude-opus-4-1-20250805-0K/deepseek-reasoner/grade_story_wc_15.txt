I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is crystalline and her ancestral sleepwalking method creates genuine internal complexity. The "haunting optimism" manifests through concrete action—sewing stone itself—though some interiority edges toward the declarative ("Her motivation was singular"). The final choice to integrate rather than erase damage shows earned wisdom with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the labyrinth transforms from ruin to "testament of care" with water as proof. The sleepwalking sequence builds density effectively, and the sewing-as-repair accumulates pressure toward the dawn revelation. Cost is visible in both physical exhaustion and the acceptance that wholeness requires integrating damage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The red canyon walls, tide pools, and labyrinth create a lived-in sacred geography that constrains choices (waiting for tide, navigating by ancestral memory). The illustration plate functions as micro-setting that enables the climactic repair. Sensory work is selective and purposeful—"orchid solace permeated the air"—though occasionally edges toward the precious.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—healing a sacred wounded place—deepens through the sleepwalking revelation and the discovery of the earthquake fissure. Escalation works through accumulation: from conscious walking to trance navigation to the physical act of sewing stone. The water's return provides tangible proof of success, though the conflict lacks a sharp reversal or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the integration of damage rather than erasure—"adorning it, integrating the break into a new, more resilient whole." The overlapping paths of ancestral walkers create resonant subtext about collective healing. The final image of Elara as "poetic weaver of the wharf who had woven a canyon whole again" reweights the opening without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"The tide pools emptied, their transient worlds retreating to the sea." The sleepwalking POV shift is handled deftly, maintaining coherence while allowing ancestral perception. Some moments edge toward purple ("hauntingly optimistic hum in her heart"), but rhythm generally supports the mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful imagery, though some figurative density crowds peak moments ("orchid solace," "luminous steps"). The sewing sequence achieves strong propulsion through concrete action. Minor issues include occasional abstract scaffolding ("Her motivation was singular") and slight overwriting in emotional beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The sleepwalking-as-navigation method offers genuine freshness, as does sewing stone with intention rather than thread. The integration of damage rather than restoration avoids the expected healing narrative. While drawing on mythic patterns, the specific synthesis of wharf-weaver skills applied to canyon repair creates memorable particularity.</comment>
