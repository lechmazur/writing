<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's contradictory nature—prophetic laughter divorced from his internal state—creates genuine tension, and his inability to control this gift drives the story's central irony. The crystallized glass wick moment and his "shadowed elation" show embodied internal conflict. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" which could be more concretely motivated in the peak moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Silas reconceptualizes his role from light-keeper to shadow-guide, with the glass wick's transformation marking this shift. The cost is legible in his acceptance of the curse-turned-compass nature of his laughter. The accumulative/textural lens holds as pattern breaks (crystallized wick, shadow channel) reweight his purpose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-setting constrains choice when the shadow it casts creates the safe channel, making environment essential to resolution. Vivid storm sensory work ("air tasted of ozone," "waves like black mountains") filtered through Silas's professional perception. The glass wick's physical transformation from ordinary to crystallized anchors the fantastical shift concretely.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through the crystallized wick discovery to the storm's arrival to Silas's involuntary laughter at the moment of greatest peril. The shadow-channel revelation meaningfully deepens understanding of his role. Cost is visible in both the ship's near-destruction and Silas's loss of control over his prophetic utterance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the light/shadow duality where salvation comes not from the expected beacon but from the darkness it creates. The glass wick's transformation signals the shift from old ways to new without explicit moralizing. The final image of Silas as "guide through the darkness" resonantly answers the central question of purpose through paradox.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive elevated register suits the herald role ("treacherous Serpent's Tooth Reef," "colossal, ancient lens") though occasionally tips toward overwriting. POV maintains consistent omniscient distance with selective access to Silas's interiority. Some filter phrases ("He felt," "He understood") could be cut for immediacy, but voice coheres around the mythic tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic variation, though density of figurative language in places ("waves like black mountains," "fury of a waking god," "ink-black shadow") borders on overwrought. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition of "ancient" and some elevated diction that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The involuntary prophetic laughter that guides through misdirection offers a fresh take on the lighthouse keeper trope. The shadow-as-salvation inversion of expected light symbolism feels earned. The glass wick transformation provides a specific, non-obvious marker of change that couldn't be easily swapped for another element.</comment>
