<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in guilt over his student's ruined future, driving concrete actions throughout. His fidgeting with the labyrinth embodies internal conflict effectively, and the final choice to surrender rather than force victory shows earned character change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("clawing need") and the epiphany arriving somewhat mechanically through the tapestry metaphor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through the labyrinth-tapestry parallel to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias's surrender opens the puzzle and achieves "fierce repose." The cost is clearly felt in his acceptance of humility over pride. Minor deduction for slightly abstract closure mechanism (the hidden plate) that could be more viscerally grounded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The time-frozen village creates effective atmosphere with "woven hush" and suspended elements, while the tapestry's frayed threads function as micro-setting that constrains choice. Strong sensory work with the platinum labyrinth's "cold, gleaming weight." Deduction for some generic elements (library with illegible books) and the village's rules never quite crystallizing beyond atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear dominant stake of self-forgiveness escalates through the tapestry discovery, where Elias must decode abandoned choices to understand his own failure. The pressure coheres well under the Accumulative lens as pattern recognition deepens. Minor deduction because the external pressure (frozen village) doesn't tighten—the conflict remains primarily internal without external complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tapestry metaphor: abandoned threads represent choices cut to save the whole, paralleling Elias's need to winnow pride from wisdom. The final insight about surrender versus victory resonates without moralizing. The "fierce repose" ending offers a non-literal answer to the forgiveness question with genuine complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled, literary register appropriate to the chess tutor's analytical mind. Strong perceptual signature in how Elias sees patterns and strategic choices everywhere. Some elevated diction ("winnow," "penance") occasionally feels forced, and the prose rhythm doesn't modulate much under emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good sentence variety and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is solid with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("tapestry of suspended breath"), some template phrasing ("Piece by piece," "And then he saw it"), and abstract constructions that could be more concrete ("fruitless churn").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tapestry-as-chess-game metaphor offers a fresh angle on self-forgiveness, transforming the typical puzzle-solving narrative. The specific synthesis of weaving, chess, and moral choice feels earned. Minor deduction for relying on somewhat familiar redemption arc structure, though executed with originality.</comment>
