I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is a **Causal** narrative - each discovery drives the next action through because/therefore linkage. Elara receives telegram → seeks variable star → discovers astronomical code → sends dream message → saves lives.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving concrete choices from dream observation to active intervention. Her shift from passive chronicler to active healer shows earned agency with visible cost (breaking her observer role). Minor deduction for some abstract emotional language ("cold and brilliant" understanding) but the final choice to intervene carries genuine stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from telegram to resolution with clear Decisive Change - Elara transforms from observer to active participant, saving lives. The astronomical discovery creates legitimate because/therefore linkage. Cost is visible in breaking her observer role and the weeks of waiting. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting with brass/oak details and the distinction between dream-lens and celestial wings creates functional space. The variable star's luminosity curve constrains the solution path. However, the desert setting remains generic and doesn't pressure choices beyond basic geography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal concern (brother's safety) to citywide threat (impending cataclysm). The tightening occurs when Elara realizes the temples are astronomical events, forcing immediate action. The cost of breaking her observer role to actively intervene is clear, though the resolution lacks immediate dramatic pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of "shared burdens" evolves from anxiety to understanding to action, with the final line explicitly reweighting it as "shared history." The astronomical code as collective memory works well. Slight deduction for the explicit thematic statement in the final paragraph rather than letting the image carry the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formality appropriate to the period setting. Perceptual details like "daylily-pressed telegram, its paper thin and fragrant" show selective attention. Dialogue between Elara and Alaric carries appropriate register. Some filter phrases ("she felt," "she knew") slightly dull immediacy in key moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Some overwriting in metaphorical language ("subconscious cartographies," "witching hour when the world was soft and suggestible"). A few instances of telling over showing ("Understanding dawned, cold and brilliant") but momentum remains strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of dream archaeology linked to astronomical phenomena offers a fresh synthesis. The twist that temples are events rather than buildings provides genuine surprise. The execution feels somewhat safe, following expected beats once the premise is established, but the specific combination of elements creates originality.</comment>
