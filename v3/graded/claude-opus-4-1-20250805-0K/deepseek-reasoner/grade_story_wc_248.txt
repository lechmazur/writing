I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages from Elara's exile through her acts of arson to reveal archives, culminating in her public gift of knowledge.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and consistent - academic exile drives her to liberate hoarded knowledge through arson. Her internal contradiction between destruction and preservation plays out through embodied choices. The final renunciation of secrecy for connection lands with visible cost ("volcano of hope and fear").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear causal chain from arson to archive discovery to public revelation. The closure (Decisive Change from secrecy to sharing) lands with emotional cost in "tender, breaking thing." Orientation anchors who/where/when early. The promise motif threads through and reweights at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Kythian archive and tapestry fragment constrain Elara's final choice between burning and sharing. Sensory details ("smelling of dust and time," "muted ochres and blues") are selective and purposeful. The university wall becomes the crucible for her transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal vindication to cultural preservation to public gifting. The urge to burn the final tapestry ("rose in her chest like magma") creates genuine tension before her choice to share. Cost is visible in her "tender, breaking" smile as she gives away her secret.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between hoarding and sharing knowledge, without explicit moralizing. The "vandalized self-portrait" metaphor reweights from destruction to completion. The child understanding the woven code pays off the opening promise beautifully.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent academic precision ("analytically intuitive") filtered through exile's bitterness. "Volcanic tenderness" paradox holds throughout. Some register elevation in peak moments ("magma," "radiant, defiant banner") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm variation. Information density is good - most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor overwriting in metaphor clusters ("volcano of hope and fear," "tender, breaking thing") and some elevated diction ("lectern," "ochres") that occasionally feels forced.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lending library arsonist who preserves culture through destruction is genuinely fresh. The Kythian civilization expressing history through woven art is specific and non-obvious. The transformation from isolated vandal to public gift-giver feels earned and surprising.</comment>
