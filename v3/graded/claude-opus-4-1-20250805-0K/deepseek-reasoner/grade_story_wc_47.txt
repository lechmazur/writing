I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and symbolic resonance rather than causal plot mechanics, culminating in a shared moment of understanding.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to reclaim her wounds through the moss garden is embodied and specific, with concrete details like "fingers smudged with soil" and the amber pendant grounding her emotional state. The arrival of Leo creates a genuine relational crucible where both characters' vulnerabilities intersect meaningfully. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "grafting new meaning" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as both characters shift from isolation to shared refuge, with the moss offering as the crystallizing gesture. The accumulative lens holds as water patterns, moss growth, and the amber pendant build toward the final image of "grafting new meaning, together." Cost is visible in their mutual vulnerability and the foreclosed path of solitary healing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned data center turned moss garden brilliantly constrains and enables the story's choices - it's both refuge and transformation space. The dripping water patterns create a living, evolving environment that mirrors the emotional arc. The contrast between "skeletal server racks" and thriving moss deepens the reclamation theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of reclaiming personal narrative after public exposure escalates through Leo's arrival, forcing Lyra from solitary healing to shared vulnerability. The proffered moss becomes a test of trust with real cost - opening her sanctuary to another wounded person. The water patterns' constant change reinforces impermanence as both threat and possibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the moss growing on abandoned technology - new life from digital ruins. The water patterns that "never repeat" offer a non-literal answer about identity's fluidity after exposure. The amber pendant's "trapped prehistoric heart" subtly contrasts with the ephemeral present without heavy-handed symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyra's perceptual signature is distinct - she sees patterns others miss, notices "honeyed hush" and "glistening, ephemeral map." Dialogue is minimal but effective, with Leo's hesitant entrance and Lyra's sparse responses maintaining subtext. Some filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") slightly dull immediacy in places.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments like "cavernous hall, once humming with servers, was now a sanctuary of green silence" with good rhythm variation. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "quietly proactive diligence"/"quietly proactive nature" and repetitive "she saw/felt" constructions. The water pattern description approaches purple prose without quite crossing over.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The data center moss garden is a fresh setting that avoids cliché responses to digital exposure. The parallel between two different whistleblowers finding refuge together adds originality. The specific detail of moss growing from old CPUs transforms a familiar "nature reclaims technology" trope through lived particularity.</comment>
