<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Alistair's withdrawal manifests through concrete details ("armor grown heavier with silence than battle") and his motivation evolves from glory-seeking to understanding possibility itself. The internal contradiction between his thick gauntlets and delicate unsnapping work creates embodied tension. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract epiphany about "possibility" that could use more grounding, though the final lightening of armor lands with earned emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught intensification through the unsnapping sequence, each release building toward the resonant reconfiguration where the puppet transforms from predetermined script to "pure embodiment of what could be." The cost is legible in Alistair's "terrifying and ecstatic rush" and the soul-lightening that follows. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of "possibility" as stakes, though the greenhouse consciousness and ritual mechanics ground it sufficiently.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively constrains choice through its mystical properties—trees bearing gemstone fruit, vines weaving light equations, and most critically, the silver bell tree holding the marionette that drives the entire ritual. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (ozone/nectar scent, crystalline chimes). The "unstable ground" and breathing greenhouse create environmental pressure that shapes Alistair's careful negotiation through space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each unsnapped binding increases the "tremor in the world" and Alistair's own transformation, with clear cost in the "terrifying and ecstatic rush of pure potential." The dominant stake—understanding/shaping reality's new form—tightens through the ritual's progression. Minor deduction for the relatively passive nature of the conflict (no active opposition), though the internal tension and world-tremors provide sufficient pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of unsnapping predetermined scripts to enable new possibilities, avoiding explicit moralizing. The marionette's transformation from puppet to "pure embodiment of what could be" resonates without stating its meaning. The final image of knight and idea walking toward dawn effectively reweights the opening's heavy silence, though "possibility itself" occasionally trends toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevated register appropriate to the fantastical setting ("cathedral of glass and iron," "equations of light"). The greenhouse's consciousness speaking through vibration rather than sound shows creative POV handling. Some register elevation in places ("factually mystical dew," "terrible form") that occasionally distances from immediacy, though generally the prose texture supports the otherworldly atmosphere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("armor had grown heavier with silence than with battle"), though some elevated diction occasionally obscures ("negotiation with the unstable ground"). Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor issues with abstract phrasing around "possibility" and "shape of the future" that could be more concrete, plus occasional redundancy ("terrifying and ecstatic" could be compressed).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quest narrative with reality-shifting metaphysics, where a knight's mission isn't combat but ritual unsnapping of predetermined scripts. The marionette-as-miniature-knight creates an original recursive image. The transformation from seeking glory to seeking possibility shows genuine complexity, and the greenhouse consciousness as a sentient space offers a non-obvious angle on the enchanted location trope.</comment>
