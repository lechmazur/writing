<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is crystal clear and her patient, methodical characterization remains consistent throughout. The internal experience of purpose and quiet power is embodied effectively, particularly in "fingers, delicate yet strong as stone." Minor deduction for the pretender's characterization existing only as concept until the dissolution scene, though this serves the story's focus.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear closure through Decisive Change - the pretender's unmasking via the rune of drift. The cost is visible in the pretender's public humiliation and loss of power. Causality holds as Elara's centuries of research lead to finding the exact rune needed. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the "reaching across distance" mechanism.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The library setting actively constrains Elara's search through its labyrinthine nature and decay. Vivid sensory details like "air thick with the scent of ozone and slow decay" and the leviathan-hide folio create atmosphere. The setting functions as both obstacle and resource, though the pretender's palace arrives late and lacks comparable texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear escalation from searching to finding to activating the rune, with stakes crystallizing around the pretender's false reign. The cost manifests in the pretender's complete undoing - "bewildered, ordinary face of the man beneath." One meaningful deepening occurs when the rune reveals not force but subtlety is needed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between true power (Elara's patient subtlety) and false power (the pretender's maintained illusion). The rune of drift as "unraveling" rather than destroying resonates thematically. The ending reweights the entire quest - truth restored through whispered secrets rather than force.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled, elevated diction matching the mythic scope - "across the pause of shifting constellations." POV remains stable in close third. Some register elevation in phrases like "monumental archive" and "profound precision" fits the epic tone but occasionally distances.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and strong imagery. Information density is high, particularly in the dissolution sequence. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("profound black," "profound precision") and some elevated diction that borders on purple ("perfume of graceful collapse"). The closing image effectively returns to Elara's continued quest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of using ancient saliva to activate dormant ink is fresh, as is the rune of drift working through gentle unraveling rather than force. The pretender's dissolution scene offers original imagery - "like a chalk drawing in the rain." Some familiar fantasy elements (ancient libraries, fallen kingdoms) are transformed through specific execution.</comment>
