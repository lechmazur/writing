I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern toward a transformative moment where accumulated longing manifests into reality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is deeply embodied through the "hollow of her own chest" and her compulsive gathering of light. The contradiction between her role as keeper of dead knowledge and her active transformation of light shows genuine internal complexity. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "cipher of longing" which could be more concretely embodied in early beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the lighthouse beam transforms whispered longings into reality, with clear cost in the "energy spent" and permanent alteration of the world. The accumulative structure builds beautifully from individual gathering to archipelago-wide transformation. The pattern of light-painting establishes early and pays off decisively when redirected through the beacon.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse, palette, and beacon lens function as micro-settings that directly constrain and enable choices. The "stone lighthouse whose beacon had been dark for a century" establishes both limitation and potential. The environment actively participates through the whispers and their physical transformation, particularly the barren rock sprouting puffins.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative pressure: from routine light-gathering to the "sharp, desperate cry" that triggers frantic action, to the beam's transformation of the entire archipelago. The cost is visible in the spent energy and the permanent change from whispers to silence. One meaningful deepening that changes the world's fundamental state.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of longing-made-manifest emerges entirely through concrete action, never stated. The final transformation from "recording absence" to "vitalize" offers a resonant answer about creation versus documentation. The shift from whispers to silence reweights the entire archipelago's existence without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("the cipher of longing, a language of sighs encoded in the very salt air"). Perceptual signature strong in how Elara experiences light as tangible substance. Minor deduction for occasional elevation that slightly exceeds the POV's established register ("luminous absence").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Some figurative density in places ("hollow of her own chest," "tide through fingers") that serves the accumulative mode. Minor redundancy in "beautiful, but static" construction and slight overwriting in the "silver leaves" catalog.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of painting with captured light and the lighthouse-as-projector transformation is genuinely fresh. The specific synthesis of library, lighthouse, and light-painting creates something memorable. The transformation from passive recording to active creation offers a non-obvious resolution.</comment>
