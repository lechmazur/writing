<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is crystal clear—unraveling Valerius's code through embodied action rather than abstract longing. The moment when "her heart pounding" after seeing the Maestro's face provides genuine embodied emotion at closure. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "profound peace" description of the ghost's expression, which edges toward label-speak rather than specific visual detail.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the realization that the code is "not to be broken, but a connection to be made" transforms meaning with visible cost (the ghostly face appearing and vanishing). The orientation anchors (flooded opera house, cellist, ghost's code) establish cleanly by ~100 words. The closure lands with both conceptual repricing and felt cost through the spectral appearance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The flooded opera house functions as the instrument itself—"the entire opera house was performing with her"—directly constraining and enabling Elara's choices throughout. Vivid sensory work: "dark water cold around her knees," "velvet-draped boxes," water creating musical responses. The environment literally becomes the medium for resolution, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pattern: single note → water response → full orchestral dialogue → whirlpool revelation. The dominant stake (understanding the ghost's message) tightens as each musical phrase reveals the opera house as co-performer. Cost is visible when the Maestro's face appears then vanishes—a connection made but immediately lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the water-music dialogue: connection across time, art transcending death, communication beyond words. The final insight—"a bridge across time, built from music and water"—reweights all prior imagery without moralizing. The "sacred, drowned space" sanctifies loss through specificity rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: Elara notices musical notation in water damage, feels "closest to him" in specific architectural spaces, interprets water drops as "perfect harmonic." POV remains rock-solid with no head-hopping. Slight deduction for "profound peace" which briefly shifts into external assessment of the ghost's emotional state.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. However, "profound peace" and "sacred, drowned space" edge toward elevated register in the closure beat. Minor template cadence in "She stopped...She opened...She had to" sequence. The "unstruck chords" motif bookends effectively without forcing symbolic weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The water-as-instrument concept offers genuine freshness—transforming flood damage into musical notation and the flooded building into a responsive instrument. The ghost-musician dialogue through environmental response feels specific. Deduction for the somewhat familiar "artist communes with predecessor's ghost" frame, though the water-music synthesis partially transforms it.</comment>
