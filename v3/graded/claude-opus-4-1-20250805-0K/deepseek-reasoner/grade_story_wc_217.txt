<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find beauty in the incomplete drives consistent micro-choices throughout, from running toward the drake's distress to her gentle, deliberate approach that transforms fear into trust. The final choice to embrace "lovely cracks" shows earned wisdom through concrete experience, though internal contradiction could be more visceral during the rescue.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where the drake's feather becomes a "testament to the beautiful incomplete," reweighting the opening quest with visible cost (the torn kite, the creature's pain transformed). The pattern of incomplete beauty accumulates through broken shells, torn fabric, and single feather to land with conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon, salt-pruned pine, and wet sand create tactile specificity that grounds the piece. The drake's iridescent scales "the color of oil on water" and the feather holding "a thousand captured dawns" elevate description, though the setting could more actively constrain choices beyond providing the rescue location.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds from quiet observation through the kite's violent snap to the drake's "sharp with fear and pain" cries, forcing Elara from observer to active participant. The cost is legible in the creature's suffering and Elara's patient work, though the resolution comes somewhat easily once she begins humming.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of finding beauty in brokenness emerges organically through concrete particulars—the drake's single feather becomes more precious than a whole wing. The final insight that "The story was in the fracture, the poem in the missing piece" resonates without moralizing, earned through the specific rescue experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows in phrases like "fleeting mirrors" and "burnished hush," with controlled psychic distance that pulls close during the rescue. Some elevated diction ("calmative force," "exquisite, broken pieces") occasionally drifts from Elara's established register but maintains overall coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the rescue sequence. However, abstract phrases like "harmonizing discord" and "fractured moment" lean purple, and some paraphrase loops appear ("beautiful incomplete" echoes across multiple paragraphs without adding pressure).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The drake rescue provides a fresh angle on the beauty-in-brokenness theme, avoiding cliché through specific details like the feather's internal light. The piece commits to its lyric mode but doesn't take significant risks beyond the established pattern of incomplete beauty.</comment>
