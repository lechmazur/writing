<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by profound loneliness and desire to restore beauty to a mechanical world. His fervent energy and trembling hands during assembly embody internal tension effectively. The final renunciation (accepting imperfect miracle over true rebirth) carries visible emotional cost through tears and kneeling. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("quaking reverie") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing through assembly sequence to spectral emergence. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the ghostly bird's song awakens wonder in the mechanical city, reweighting Kaelen's failure as sufficient success. Cost is visible in tears, kneeling, and accepting transience over permanence. The "flawed genesis" setup pays off when imperfection yields unexpected grace.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The suspended palace with crystalline corridors and stalactite chains creates vivid constraint for isolation. Sensory details effectively narrow during assembly (trembling hands, humming crystals) then expand at closure (brass flowers turning). The glass dome's view of the abyss reinforces vertigo and separation. Setting actively shapes the prince's loneliness and makes the final city-wide awakening meaningful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from dormant egg through meticulous assembly to the agonizing hour of waiting, with each stage narrowing options. The crack/emergence reversal transforms hope into bittersweet acceptance. Agency drives the assembly and acceptance of imperfect outcome. Cost is legible in accepting ghostly memory over true life, with the mechanical city's response validating the sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the spectral bird as "memory given form" reframes the entire endeavor from resurrection to remembrance. The final awakening of mechanical flowers to ghostly song offers a non-literal answer about beauty's persistence in unexpected forms. The "bitterly sweet elegy" and wave of awakening avoid tidy resolution while maintaining coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevation appropriate to fairy-tale register, with selective perception focused on mechanical/crystalline details. "Groaning" palace, "calcified egg," and "spectral bird" create cohesive texture. Some moments edge toward purple ("dizzying view of the fog-shrouded abyss") but rhythm control during assembly sequence effectively builds tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence lengths and strong verbs ("navigated," "clutched," "thrummed"). Information density high in assembly sequence. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("quaking reverie" appears twice; "immeasurably sad") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete. Final image of brass flowers turning effectively closes without exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The extinct bird's egg birthing a ghost rather than life offers genuine surprise that feels earned. Mechanical city responding to ethereal song creates fresh synthesis of organic/artificial. The "flawed genesis" concept transforms from failure to unexpected success. Some fairy-tale conventions remain familiar but the specific resolution—awakening wonder rather than life—shows originality.</comment>
