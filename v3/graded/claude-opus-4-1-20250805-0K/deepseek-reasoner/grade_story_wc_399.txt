<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve the prophet's echo is clear and drives consistent action through ritual binding. The scout's "strangely honest" state becomes a tool that sharpens her work, showing good use of secondary character pressure. Minor deduction for the scout's sudden appearance feeling slightly convenient, though his unguarded consciousness does alter tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—the echo's preservation in stone with the scout as unwitting catalyst. The cost is felt through Elara's weariness and the echo's fragility ("would soon fade"). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The ritual's success changes the world state (wisdom preserved for centuries), meeting closure requirements.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet beneath the dunes functions as micro-setting that enables the ritual—"a buried ribcage of ancient, moving stone that channeled the desert's deep energies." Setting constrains choice through the need for this specific power source. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("sun-warmed mosaic floor," "ochre sand"), supporting the mystical atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation operates through textural accumulation: from sensing the echo in dust motes, to conjuring the clearing, to binding via the parapet's power. The scout's arrival adds unexpected pressure that Elara adapts to, using his consciousness as a tool. Cost is visible in the echo's fragility and Elara's physical exhaustion after completion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the preservation of wisdom against transience—"a fragile thing, a resonance that would soon fade into the desert's silence." The scout's innocent perception becoming instrumental suggests truth needs both keeper and witness. The final image of wisdom "humming for centuries, waiting for the next one who could listen" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct mystical voice with controlled diction ("whisperfield calm," "peripheral awareness"). POV remains stable with Elara throughout. The scout's brief dialogue feels appropriately flat and direct under the clearing's influence. Perceptual signature strong in how Elara reads the world through edges and pressures rather than direct sight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clean, purposeful prose with good rhythm variation and no loops or scaffolding. Strong information density—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Figurative language serves the mystical tone without overwhelming ("a buried ribcage of ancient, moving stone"). Minor deduction for slight repetition of "ancient" as descriptor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of preserving ephemeral wisdom through magical means offers a fresh angle on the keeper-of-knowledge archetype. The scout's consciousness becoming an unexpected tuning fork is inventive. Some elements feel familiar (desert mystic, ancient stones) but the specific synthesis and "peripheral awareness" method provide originality.</comment>
