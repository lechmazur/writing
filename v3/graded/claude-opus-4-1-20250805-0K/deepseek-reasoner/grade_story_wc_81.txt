<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's tranquilly perceptive nature manifests through concrete sensory recalibration during the blackout, and her final choice to preserve rather than expose the truth carries visible cost—she becomes complicit in a lie. The internal conflict between duty to truth and pragmatic preservation plays out through physical action with the stamp, not abstract deliberation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change: Elara transforms from neutral indexer to active keeper of dangerous truth, with the cost of complicity visible in her deliberate mislabeling. The causal lens holds—the blackout enables discovery, discovery forces choice, choice reconfigures her role. Who/where/when anchored early ("Aqualibrium," "Logical Page Indexer," blackout context).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sunken library's water-ceiling and emergency lighting create atmospheric pressure, while the antique stamp's physical mechanism (pressure-imprint revealing palimpsest) constrains the discovery method. Setting details like "canyon-like aisles" and "pressurized groan of the ocean" reinforce isolation during the moral choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from cataloging duty to civilizational truth when the palimpsest reveals conquest rather than welcome. The blackout's unique cover ("no system logs") tightens Elara's choice window, and her decision to mislabel carries the clear cost of becoming complicit in historical erasure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the palimpsest metaphor—truth literally buried beneath official narrative—without explicit moralizing. The final image of Elara as "keeper of a deeper, quieter truth" reweights her indexing role from passive cataloger to active guardian, with moral ambiguity intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formal register appropriate to Elara's profession ("cross-referencing founding myths," "alternative hypothesis") with selective perception during crisis (hearing "minute shift of a settling shelf"). Some filter-verb clustering ("She could hear," "She could report") slightly dulls immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "reclaimed stillness"/"forced pause," "honest origins"/"truest version," and the final paragraph over-explains Elara's future intentions. Information density drops in exposition-heavy middle sections about the competing histories.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The palimpsest-as-hidden-truth device offers a concrete twist on the familiar "discovered document" trope, and the protagonist choosing complicity over exposure subverts expected whistleblower narrative. The underwater library setting and pressure-sensitive revelation method show specific world-building.</comment>
