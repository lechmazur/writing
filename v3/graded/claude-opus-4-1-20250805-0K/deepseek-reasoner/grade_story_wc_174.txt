<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal contradiction between defending factual purity and performing subversive puppet shows creates genuine complexity, with her final choice to "reverse the expectation of a single truth" earned through concrete discovery of the story stick. The shift from anger to "uncommonly serene grip" tracks believably, though some interior phrasing edges toward over-articulation ("beautiful, ethical burden").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's discovery of the story stick reverses her thinking from presenting truth to creating space for listeners' truths, with the cost being her abandonment of defensive certainty. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details (dome, stick, puppet shows) build toward this conceptual shift, though the connection between calligraphy and puppet shows could be more causally tight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The radar dome functions as more than setting—its "geodesic cavern" and "meteor hush" create the contemplative space necessary for Elara's reversal, while the story stick's specific carvings (hawk, key, willow) ground the abstraction. The dome's transformation from "cold war anxiety" relic to sacred thinking space mirrors Elara's own shift, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("sky bruised with twilight").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation operates through accumulative pressure as Elara moves from heated argument to solitude to discovery to epiphany, with the story stick enabling the crucial reversal that she must create space for others' truths rather than defend her own. The cost—abandoning her fortress of fact—is legible, though the stakes could tighten further if we saw more specific consequences of her publisher conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of ethical storytelling emerges through concrete particulars—the story stick's communal nature versus solitary calligraphy, puppet shows that measure truth in "uncomfortable silences," and the final insight about making audiences "complicit in the beautiful, ethical burden." The ending's image of returning with "method forever changed" resonates without moralizing, though "beautiful, ethical burden" edges toward explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's voice maintains sophisticated consistency with phrases like "urbane calligrapher" and "ordered world," while her perceptual signature (noticing the dome's "skeletal ribs," feeling the stick's "weight...like an accusation") stays character-specific. Some interior passages drift toward over-articulation ("What if the stories weren't in the telling, but in the hearing?"), and dialogue absence prevents full voice distinction testing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("dome's great bowl arching over her like the inside of a skull") and varies rhythm effectively, but suffers from occasional redundancy ("beautiful, ethical burden" appears twice) and some filter-heavy passages in the middle third. The opening and closing sentences anchor well, though middle sections contain scaffolding phrases that could be cut for momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of high calligraphy with subversive puppet shows offers genuine freshness, particularly the insight that both are "forms of truth-telling" through opposite methods—one permanent beauty, the other "rough, immediate, and unsettling impact." The story stick as catalyst for reversing perspective from telling to hearing transforms the familiar artist-versus-commerce conflict, though the "ethical storytelling" frame occasionally feels prompt-derived.</comment>
