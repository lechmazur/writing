<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's wistfulness and connection to memory drive her decisive choice to break the seal, earning closure through visible emotional cost. The contradictory impulses between preservation and release act simultaneously in scene when she trembles before breaking the seal. Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("pained validation") rather than pure embodiment in supporting beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elara's seal-breaking as shared understanding, with emotional cost visible in tears and trembling. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the scent revelation that reweights her relationship to preserved memory. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Slight deduction as the cost, while felt, could be more precisely articulated beyond emotional release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting with "crystal shadows" and extinct flora constrains Elara's careful movement and shapes her emotional response. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, particularly the "cascade" of scents. The environment doesn't quite constrain the final choice directly, capping at 8.8 per the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres through the UV revelation triggering unexpected personal grief, forcing Elara from professional detachment to vulnerable participation. The bloom's brief window creates temporal pressure. Cost is visible in decade-held tears finally falling. The escalation is more emotional deepening than active choice-narrowing under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that scent unlocks visceral memory, not through statement. The final gesture of sharing the vial offers a non-literal answer about preservation versus experience. Subtext operates beautifully in Kaelen watching Elara rather than the flower. Minor deduction for slight thematic articulation ("The mind remembers, but the soul weeps").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "aromatically cautious" breathing and wistful observations. Voice modulates effectively from professional precision to emotional overwhelm. Dialogue carries subtext well, particularly Kaelen's shift from scientist to "fellow traveler." Some filter verb accumulation ("she had held back") prevents 8.0+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong sensory specificity and information density, with lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in peak beats ("cathedral of crystal shadows") and occasional redundancy ("hot and silent") create minor friction. No major loops or scaffolding. Rhythm varies appropriately with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of light-broker profession with memory preservation offers a non-obvious angle on grief. The specific UV spectrum triggering extinct scent that matches personal memory is inventive. The transformation from scientific observation to shared human understanding feels earned. Doesn't quite reach exceptional originality but avoids all template patterns.</comment>
