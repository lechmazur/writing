<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodied emotion ("The words flowed from me") and clear motivation rooted in paying for father's sins. The protagonist's contradictory impulses between silence and truth-telling create genuine internal conflict. Loses points for some abstract phrasing ("ghost I could never exorcise") and the final choice, while earned, could use more visceral cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with effective Resonant Reconfiguration closure where truth-telling banishes the lie-feeding entity. The lattice transforms from confessional tool to containment device, creating meaningful cost. Orientation anchors establish lighthouse prison setting early. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution mechanism where speaking truth directly defeats the entity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details ("copperlight repose," "metallic twilight") effectively build atmosphere. The lighthouse setting constrains choices throughout, from isolation to the storm's impact. The lattice as micro-setting object charges the final image. Some generic descriptions ("black mountain" wave) prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from imprisonment for father's lies to confronting a lie-feeding entity that threatens escape. The storm creates pressure that forces descent and discovery. Cost is visible in the protagonist's choice to speak truth despite disbelief. The hovering entity's appearance feels slightly abrupt without more groundwork.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus lies emerges organically through the father's legacy, the protagonist's imprisonment, and the entity that feeds on falsehoods. The lattice as containment tool offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question. Final image of clutching the lattice with "my story now a part of its grain" effectively reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and effective modulation during stress ("I was chasing hush"). Strong perceptual signature in how the narrator notices light and sound. Some elevated diction ("exorcise," "penitent") fits the gothic tone but occasionally drifts from natural voice. Clean POV maintenance throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density works well in descriptive passages. Several instances of elevated diction that border on overwriting ("granite silence," "deep and waiting void"). Some repetitive phrasing around light descriptions reduces score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh angle on the cry-wolf concept through generational punishment and the lighthouse prison setting. The lattice as both confessional tool and entity container offers original synthesis. The lie-feeding entity concept, while interesting, relies somewhat on familiar supernatural tropes without full transformation.</comment>
