<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to safeguard innovation drives consistent choices through puzzle-solving and deception, with her final decision to bury the seed showing clear cost (risking discovery). However, the antagonists remain faceless abstractions ("suppressors"), and internal conflict relies on telling ("felt a thrill") rather than embodied contradiction in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain from seed receipt to protective deception, with Elara's escape room expertise enabling the solution. The closure lands with Earned Stasis—she successfully safeguards the seed at the cost of constant vigilance—but the stakes feel abstract ("zones of unbearable distraction") rather than viscerally demonstrated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The escape room setting functions as both Elara's domain and her weapon, constraining the hunters' movements in the climax. The brook serves as a recurring anchor and final hiding place, though much description remains ornamental ("whispered puzzles and flowing thought") without affecting choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity to active threat as Elara discovers the seed's weaponization potential and hunters arrive. The protagonist drives the resolution through her escape room trap, though the antagonists' arrival feels convenient and their specific threat remains vague.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of safeguarding innovation emerges through Elara's actions and the seed's symbolic potential, with the escape room serving as metaphor for protective puzzles. However, the story explicitly states its thesis multiple times ("safeguard space for innovation"), reducing subtext to text.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and uses escape room vocabulary appropriately ("orthogonal approaches"). However, register drift into academic exposition ("hyper-resonant, notably receptive to specific sonic frequencies") breaks POV credibility, and no dialogue tests voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose flows clearly with varied sentence structure, though figurative language occasionally strains ("storm-born silence" appears twice without earning its weight). Exposition-heavy middle sections slow momentum, and phrases like "orthogonal methodology" feel forced rather than organic to the voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The escape room proprietor receiving a dangerous botanical mystery offers a fresh angle, and using the business as protective camouflage shows ingenuity. However, the weaponized corpse flower concept feels contrived, and the vague antagonists ("suppressors") lack specificity.</comment>
