I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece that builds through atmospheric density and pattern accumulation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the stones reveal a cosmic vision that reframes the rebellion's meaning.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking patterns in chaos—with strong embodied details like "toes curling against the grit." The transformation from "awkwardly confident" to "pure, undeniable certainty" feels earned through the stone circle's activation. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient epiphany about the stones' purpose, though the physical grounding helps.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the cosmic vision reweights the rebellion's meaning from anger to awe. The accumulative build through ritual, hum, and revelation coheres well. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "truth" revealed, though "a jewel worth protecting" provides specificity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory detail throughout—"cool, oil-stained permacrete," the deep hum "felt more than heard." The abandoned spaceport and stone circle create atmospheric pressure. The environment constrains choice when Elara must enter the circle to activate it. Slight deduction for the generic "vast, interconnected web" description at climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding meaning to reignite rebellion—builds through atmospheric accumulation. The "thunderous serenity" and "paralysis" create palpable tension. The escalation from personal ritual to collective revelation works, though the resolution feels slightly convenient without showing concrete opposition or cost beyond "grief."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between violence and witness, chaos and pattern. The final image of rebels' faces showing "fire...forged not in anger, but in awe" resonates without stating a moral. The cosmic perspective effectively reframes local struggle. Minor deduction for the slightly overwrought "jewel worth protecting" metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm—"cathedral to a dream of the stars that had died decades ago." POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature. Some elevated diction ("thunderous serenity," "赋予它") feels slightly forced. The shift to direct address through comm-link works well for urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong imagery. However, several issues: the garbled characters "赋予它" break immersion, "tuning fork for her very soul" verges on purple prose, and some repetitive phrasing around "thunderous serenity." The final paragraph contains some template cadence ("She had given them...And in the silent...They had discovered").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The barefoot stargazer finding meaning through ancient stones offers a fresh angle on rebellion narrative. The synthesis of cosmic perspective with local struggle feels specific. However, the "chosen one activates ancient artifact" resolution follows familiar patterns. The atmospheric execution elevates somewhat generic bones.</comment>
