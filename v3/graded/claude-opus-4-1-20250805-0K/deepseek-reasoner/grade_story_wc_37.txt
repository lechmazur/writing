<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra's fragmented identity as memory keeper creates genuine internal tension between her borrowed memories and the need to find an untarnished dawn. The weaving action reveals hierarchy of values through concrete choice—she sacrifices isolation for communal healing. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("sharp and constant ache") but the embodied craft of thread-weaving and the final communal gathering earn strong characterization marks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration through the woven dawn becoming light itself. The cost is visible—"constant tending, daily singing" required to maintain what was built. The progression from gathering memory-threads to weaving to singing creates coherent escalation that lands with earned transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse dome and memory-trees create atmospheric pressure, with the mica window serving as crucial conduit between worlds. Setting actively constrains choice through the "endless night" and enables solution through the orchard's stored memories. Slight deduction for some generic descriptors ("vast, crystalline dome") but the phosphorescent rows and wrought-iron vines provide lived-in specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes clearly established—dying realm needs rekindling before "final light guttered out." The escalation from climbing to gather vision, to weaving threads, to singing the forgotten song creates meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible in the ongoing maintenance required and the transformation from isolation to community.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of weaving fragmented memories into wholeness, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of "memory of light had become light itself" offers resonant answer to the central question of how to restore a dying world. Strong integration of gathering/binding motif throughout without forcing symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent lyric voice with controlled distance, though some moments edge toward purple prose ("phosphorescent rows," "library of borrowed moments"). The perceptual signature of experiencing fragmented memories is distinctive. Rhythm modulates effectively from contemplative opening to active weaving to communal resolution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some overwriting appears ("sharp and constant ache," "frantic drum"). Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor template cadence in middle section ("She did not... Instead, she... From the branches, she...") reduces momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The mirror world concept with memory-bearing trees offers fresh angle on restoration narrative. The specific synthesis of weaving light-threads into dawn tapestry feels earned rather than arbitrary. Some elements trend toward familiar fantasy tropes but the execution through craft metaphor provides sufficient transformation.</comment>
