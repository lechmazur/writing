<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to inscribe forbidden memory onto her skin is clear and compelling, with concrete embodiment through the tattoo ritual. The internal conflict between grief and rebellion manifests physically in her "spontaneously anchored" stillness versus her former tide-dancing fluidity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("obsidian grace" repeated without earning its metaphor) and the final transformation feeling slightly rushed, though the cost of exile and physical pain registers clearly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the tattoo ritual building density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms from exile to "portable eternity." The closure lands with visible cost (pain, exile, moonstone's irreplaceable nature) and conceptual cost (permanent bodily inscription of outlawed memory). The piece teaches its pattern early through gaps/silences as lexicon and pays off with the living constellation map.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The twilight garden and its "silver-leafed plants and deep purple blossoms" anchor the setting with selective detail that mirrors Elara's liminal state. The moonstone dust and needle function as micro-setting that constrains choice (last pigment, one chance). Spatial choreography from bench to garden's edge tracks cleanly. Missing higher band because the garden itself doesn't actively pressure choices beyond providing isolation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing the forbidden tattoo before her last moonstone dust is gone—creates genuine pressure through scarcity. Escalation occurs through the accumulation of each constellation ("The Sorrowful Weaver, The Last Whale") building toward the final seven-pointed star that ignites the entire verse. Cost is legible in pain, permanent marking, and using irreplaceable material, though the lack of external opposition limits tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of mapping forbidden memory onto flesh as rebellion against enforced amnesia. The constellations' names ("The Sorrowful Weaver, The Last Whale, The Bridge of Glass") carry thematic weight without explanation. The final image of "portable eternity" and being "forever anchored to its mortal host" offers a resonant answer about how memory persists through embodiment rather than erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevation ("obsidian grace," "cosmic verse on mortal flesh") that matches the story's lyric mode. The perceptual signature shows in how Elara reads absence: "pauses in conversation, missing verses in a song." Minor deduction for occasional register drift into abstract philosophy ("spontaneously anchored by a profound and private grief") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The law had taken her past; she would not let it take her future"). Some overwriting in figurative density ("obsidian grace" appears twice, "sharp and beautiful severance") and abstract phrasing ("profound and private grief," "portable eternity") that could be more concrete. The final paragraph has momentum but relies on telling ("She was not waiting for a change") rather than showing through action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The nostalgia ban premise offers a fresh angle on memory and rebellion, with the specific twist of tattooing constellations using star-dust. The image of learning history through gaps and absences shows originality. The execution stays within familiar dystopian territory but the embodied response through skin-inscription and the detail of grandmother's whispered constellations provide specificity that elevates beyond template.</comment>
