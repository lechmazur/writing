<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's artistic drought and desperate ache for creative joy establish clear motivation, with her transformation from despair to rediscovered purpose earned through concrete discovery and action. The knowledge network moment provides genuine internal conflict between personal and collective memory. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution of her year-long creative block through a single discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the light installation that reweights the ruined orchard's meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara realizes "joy was not lost; she had simply needed to learn how to see in the dark" with visible emotional cost in the crowd's response. The knowledge network functions as a crucial turn that bridges discovery to creation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ruined orchard's fog-shrouded desolation contrasts powerfully with the phantom light-tree, with setting actively constraining Elara's medium choice (no pigments, must use light/fog). Spatial choreography of the installation is vivid and the fog becomes a collaborator. The fresco fragment functions as micro-setting that triggers the central transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal creative despair to communal memory restoration, with the knowledge network discovery forcing Elara to choose between personal and collective expression. The installation's ephemeral nature adds temporal pressure. Cost is visible in the temporary nature of her creation and the bittersweet "pensive mirth" of shared loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of finding beauty in ruin emerges organically through Elara's transformation of discarded film into luminous art. The knowledge network creates layered meaning about collective memory versus individual experience. Final image of learning "to see in the dark" resonates without moralizing, though the "pensive mirth" callback feels slightly mechanical.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature in how Elara sees the world through an artist's lens ("her soul a canvas of colors"). Some elevated diction ("omnidirectional glow," "prismatic droplets") occasionally strains against the intimate POV. The knowledge network moment maintains focalization while expanding perception credibly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery like "fog diffused the weak afternoon sun into a soft, omnidirectional glow." Some overwriting in passages like "disconnected from tangible time" and occasional abstract phrasing ("the electric thrill of creation"). The installation sequence achieves strong momentum through concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Creating art from ruined film negatives and fog-filtered light offers genuine originality, transforming the expected paint-and-canvas resolution. The knowledge network as artistic catalyst feels slightly convenient but the ephemeral light installation distinguishes the piece. The synthesis of personal and collective memory through found objects shows sophistication.</comment>
