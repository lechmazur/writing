<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's desperate jocular facade masking profound loneliness creates genuine internal contradiction, embodied through sharp laughter that "never reached her eyes." The astronomer's reciprocity-driven gift triggers authentic change from isolated efficiency to communal grace-giving, with visible cost in her choice to stop moving. Minor deduction for the astronomer remaining underdeveloped beyond his thematic function.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms from distributing goods to "distributing grace," with felt cost in abandoning her ghost-like pattern. The accumulative/textural lens holds as rumor chains, moon rock rituals, and shared stories build density toward the final image of "cosmic connection." The shift from isolation to communion lands with earned emotional weight through concrete action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ivy-choked station with "rusted husks of trains" creates atmospheric pressure while "polite anarchy" and "barely controlled chaos" establish lived-in texture. The moon rock functions as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final ritual. Spatial choreography occasionally blurs during the crowd scenes but recovers for closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Elara's private loneliness through the astronomer's challenge to the public ritual of shared stories, each deepening the cure-for-loneliness theme. The moon rock catalyzes meaningful change from transactional aid to emotional reciprocity with visible cost in Elara's transformation. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens though middle development could tighten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the moon rock's transformation from "immense distance and profound isolation" to a catalyst for "cosmic connection." The reciprocity concept deepens from simple exchange to emotional communion without stating morals. Final image of distributing grace while remaining in the "disused station" resonantly answers the loneliness question through earned paradox.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct voice modulates from Elara's "desperately jocular" performance to "serene focus," tracking emotional progression. Free indirect style controls distance effectively, though some passages drift toward explanatory summation ("The shared, silent wonder...created a fleeting, perfect communion"). Perceptual signature strongest when filtering the station's chaos through Elara's logistical lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "elusive disaster-relief logistician, a ghost who appeared" redundantly establishes the same trait. Template constructions like "She would not just...She would use it to..." and abstract summations ("distributing grace") replace concrete imagery. Strong opening and closing images partially compensate, but middle sections lose propulsive clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moon rock as cure for loneliness through story-sharing ritual offers fresh synthesis of cosmic and intimate scales. "Polite anarchy" as productive chaos distinguishes the relief station's operation. The transformation from material to emotional aid distribution feels earned, though the concept occasionally reaches for profundity over specificity.</comment>
