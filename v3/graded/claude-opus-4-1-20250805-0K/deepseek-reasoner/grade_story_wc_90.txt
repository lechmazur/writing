<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's pacifism drives meaningful choices throughout—her refusal to fight transforms into active mending that opens the dimensional door. The gravitational lightness embodying emotional states creates concrete embodiment. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("shadow work") and the convenience of her philosophy being "forged in the fires" rather than shown through specific struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure where grief literally accumulates weight until transformed through stitching into dimensional access. The closure—opening a door through compassion rather than force—lands with clear cost (processing generations of trauma). The transformation from crushing gravity to lightness provides visible change with earned causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The recycled ship functions as both setting and emotional repository, with "ghostly resolve" embedded in its structure. The gravitational shifts mirror internal states effectively. The jade tear and photographs constrain choices and enable the final transformation, though some descriptions lean generic ("silent corridors and abandoned cabins").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating emotional weight that becomes literal gravitational force, then transforms through the stitching process. The protagonist's agency drives every beat—discovering photos, choosing to mend rather than succumb, combining tear with stitched image. Cost is legible in processing "accumulated sorrow of generations."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast of mending versus fighting, with the ship itself as humanity's unresolved trauma made physical. The final image—stitching open rather than pushing—offers resonant answer to whether peace can be achieved through compassion alone. Minor deduction for explicit "shadow work" terminology.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical compression ("fossilized fact," "ghostly resolve") and controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. Some register elevation feels slightly beyond Elara's established lexicon ("repository of that pain," "act of alchemy"). POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature focused on mending and light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("crystalline residue that had outlasted the eyes that cried them"). Several instances of abstract telling ("profound sadness seeped into her," "strange peace settled") and some repetitive structures. The "shadow work" explanation and "key" metaphor feel slightly forced.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-as-gravity with the concept that unresolved trauma literally weighs down possibility. The stitching-with-light technique and dimensional access through compassion rather than force show genuine originality. The recycled ship as emotional repository avoids generic post-apocalyptic tropes.</comment>
