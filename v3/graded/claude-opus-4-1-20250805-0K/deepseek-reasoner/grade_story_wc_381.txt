<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is clear and consistent—silencing a prophecy only he can hear—with internal conflict between maintaining perfect silence and fighting the prophecy's attempts to anger him. The moment of wavering when visions threaten his concentration shows genuine struggle with visible cost. His final exhaustion and the transformation of his relationship to silence (from absence to healed presence) marks meaningful change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the silence transforms from absence to presence, from tool to "healed thing." The prophecy's escalating resistance creates a because/therefore link that forces deeper concentration. Cost is visible in the summoner's bone-deep weariness and the irreversible release of the wing. The final image of "beautiful nothing" reweights the opening's "smoothed hush" with earned peace.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the brook anchors the scene immediately and functionally—the specific silences (willow leaves, moss, water over stone) become resources the summoner weaves into his counter-frequency. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through his unique perception of silence's "contours and pressures." The origami wing's transformation from paper to vessel to ascending light provides tactile progression.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—silencing a world-ending prophecy—is clear from the start with escalation through the prophecy's counterattack showing visions meant to anger him. The summoner's momentary faltering when "the brook's babble threatened to become a roar" shows genuine risk before he returns to his center. Cost manifests in his complete exhaustion and the loss of the wing, his "sole instrument."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of aggressive peace—a "tranquil blaze" that fights through profound quiet rather than force. The transformation of silence from absence to presence, from void to "healed thing," offers a non-literal answer about power residing in restraint. The final image of the wing sailing toward stars as "terrestrial peace sent back to the cosmos" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with controlled rhythm that modulates during the prophecy's attack ("The brook's babble threatened to become a roar"). POV remains stable with appropriate narrative certainty about what only the summoner can perceive. Some elevated diction ("terrestrially cosmic," "cartographer of the void") occasionally strains but serves the mythic register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("paper thin as moth's breath," "a white scar against the dark sky") with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is generally high though some phrases border on overwriting ("terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush"). The paraphrase loop between "beautiful nothing" and earlier "nothing" descriptions slightly dulls the final impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of fighting catastrophic noise through mapped silence offers a fresh angle on the summoner archetype. The single incomplete origami wing as sole instrument—"completeness was a form of noise"—shows conceptual integrity. The story commits to its premise of silence-as-power without retreating into conventional magical combat.</comment>
