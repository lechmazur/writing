<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal journey from detached investigator to witness-bearer is earned through visceral experience of Cora's memories, with contradictory impulses (professional duty vs. human connection) acting simultaneously. The final choice to honor rather than file away the tragedy shows clear cost—forsaking Department protocol for human acknowledgment. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("fortified vulnerability") that doesn't fully embody the emotional state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with the lantern serving as a vessel for layered memories that build to Cora's tragedy. The closure—Elara placing the lantern as a grave marker and choosing remembrance over bureaucratic filing—creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (abandoning Department control). The shift from investigating "preventable deaths" to preventing erasure of human stories lands with conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tunnel setting effectively constrains choices (following memories deeper underground) and the lantern's placement in the exact spot where it shattered charges the final image. Sensory details like "gravel-strewn concrete" and "drip of post-drought condensation" ground the dual timeline. The parallel droughts (past and present) create resonance without forcing symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating memory fragments—from whispered voice to full visceral experience of Cora's flight—culminating in the revelation of Eli's death. The pressure coheres as Elara must choose between Department protocol and bearing witness. The cost is legible: professional detachment shatters as she accepts the weight of remembrance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between institutional tidiness and human truth, with the lantern's journey from hope to tragedy reweighting the concept of "preventable death." The final image of the lantern as grave marker offers a non-literal answer about acknowledgment versus erasure. Slight deduction for the somewhat explicit "her purpose now" declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual signature shows in how she processes the supernatural through investigative lens ("empirical observation," "data, a record"). Voice modulates effectively from clinical precision to emotional immersion as memories intensify. Some filter-verb clustering ("she understood," "she felt," "she saw") dulls immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some abstract constructions ("fortified vulnerability," "watchfully calm precision") and repetitive "she [verb]" patterns in memory sequences. The final paragraph contains some scaffold phrasing ("shaping a new resolve") that could be more concrete. Information density is moderate—most lines advance story but could carry more weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise of a modern investigator experiencing Underground Railroad memories through a mystical object offers a fresh angle on historical trauma. The specific detail of Eli's preventable death—not from capture but accident—subverts expectations. However, the controlling Department and investigator-finds-meaning arc follows familiar patterns without full transformation.</comment>
