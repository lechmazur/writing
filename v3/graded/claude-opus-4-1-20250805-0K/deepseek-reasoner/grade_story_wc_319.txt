<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's dimensionally homesick longing creates genuine internal contradiction between fighting and understanding uncertainty, with embodied cold and the guardian's protective fury forcing a meaningful choice. The hurled pendant represents earned renunciation with visible cost (the library's fraying edges stabilizing). Minor deduction for the guardian's motivations remaining somewhat opaque despite its central role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the garden transforming into library as density increase, culminating in Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara hurls the pendant and the boundary strengthens. Cost is visible in the library's erosion and her acceptance of displacement as connection. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words with frozen garden, dream state, and Elara's quest clear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The transformation of frozen garden into ethereal library constrains choice brilliantly—the boundary of light literally shows what's at stake. Sensory details (breath pluming, glittering ice, cold pendant) filtered through Elara's dream-logic perception. The interiorizing of exteriors makes setting itself the mechanism of understanding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal homesickness to cosmic erosion when the guardian reveals the library's decay. The pendant as corrosive artifact creates genuine pressure requiring action. Elara's agency in hurling the pendant shows clear trade-off between keeping a powerful object and saving the space.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of displacement as connection emerges organically through the parallel between Elara's homesickness and the library's erosion. The final image of "homesickness finally a quiet, understood thing" reweights the entire journey without moralizing. The cultist pendant as chaos artifact deepens the theme of boundaries and belonging.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct dream-logic voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent focalization through Elara. "Dimensionally homesick" and "interiorizing exteriors" show unique perceptual signature. Some register elevation in places like "absolute nothingness" and "sympathetic echo" slightly exceeds the dreamlike POV's natural lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("perpetual mist," "absolute silence," "profound ache"). Template cadence in "She had come... Her nights... Her motivation" creates minor drumbeat. Information density high in transformation sequence. Final image lands effectively without loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of dimensional homesickness as sympathetic resonance with eroding worlds offers fresh angle on displacement. The feral library guardian protecting a frozen garden-library pushes beyond stock dream imagery. Risk-taking in the surreal transformation sequence pays off, though some elements (cultist pendant) feel slightly convenient.</comment>
