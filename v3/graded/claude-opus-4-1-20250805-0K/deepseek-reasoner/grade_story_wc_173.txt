<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's internal revolution against conformity drives meaningful change from compliant performer to awakened individual with genuine agency. The contradiction between her role as "chaste courtesan" and her internal defiance creates productive tension. The final genuine smile marks earned transformation with visible cost - the loss of her performed identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration landing through the harvest of echoes that transforms Elara from "pale and compliant" thread to "blazing with brilliant, defiant gold." Cost is legible in the foreclosure of her previous identity. The prism sanctuary sequence effectively deepens stakes through accumulation of sensory echoes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The silver courtyard transforms from assignation space to "blank verse" enabling discovery, while the prism sanctuary's crystalline geometry constrains and shapes Elara's harvest. Snow becomes syllables, heartbeat becomes iamb - the environment actively participates in transformation. Setting directly enables the central action and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from internal defiance to cosmic connection as Elara moves from passive observation to active harvest of humanity's suppressed truths. The sanctuary's threatening vibration that "threatened to unmoor her very soul" provides genuine risk. Cost manifests in the irreversible loss of her conformist identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the harvest metaphor - gathering discarded truths reveals conformity as cage but connection as key. The final image of Elara holding the courtyard's echo while stars lose their power resonates without moralizing. The "untangling threads" conceit effectively links individual awakening to collective consciousness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled elevation ("silver courtyard under snow," "bodily poetic") that matches Elara's artistic perception. Some register drift into abstract philosophy ("collective, unseen heart of humanity") slightly weakens immediacy. Strong perceptual signature in transforming physical sensations into poetic elements.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, though occasional abstraction ("alarming serenity" appears twice, "beautiful, terrifying awareness") dulls precision. Strong rhythmic control in key passages. Minor redundancy in explaining the harvest's purpose reduces momentum slightly but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courtesan-as-observer with mystical awakening through sensory harvest. The prism sanctuary as repository of suppressed emotions offers genuine originality. The transformation of conformity's lullaby into powerless background music through active gathering of echoes feels earned and non-obvious.</comment>
