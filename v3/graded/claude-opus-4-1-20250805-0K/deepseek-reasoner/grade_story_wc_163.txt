I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through density of imagery and cadence shifts rather than causal chains, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration through the firefly moment.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's internal journey from panic to belonging is embodied through concrete reactions to the feather and fireflies. The "rhythm of belonging" motivation is dramatized through her physical responses and the final synchronized breathing. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "deep, personal need" framing early on.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the fireflies transforming Elara's relationship to both trauma and place - "the burnt feather now just a relic, not a chain." The accumulative lens holds as imagery builds toward this reconfiguration. Cost is felt in the acceptance of coexistence with loss. Slight deduction for the somewhat explicit final paragraph stating rather than showing the rhythm discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater facility setting actively constrains through "recycled air" and "pressurized labyrinth," driving Elara to seek the platform. Strong sensory work with "shadowseam wonder" and the ionized barrier. The fireflies' pressure adaptation adds specificity. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors like "ghost of glass."]</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative pressure: feather triggers panic → platform seeking → fireflies arrive → shared witnessing transforms stance. The dominant stake (finding belonging) tightens through each image. Slightly lower score as the fireflies' arrival is coincidental rather than earned through agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges organically through the contrast between "tomb" and "home," crystallizing in "wonder could coexist with loss." The fireflies work as concrete particulars rather than symbols. Deduction for the final paragraph's slight drift toward explicit thematic statement about "the rhythm of belonging."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with "Landscape Astrologer" framing how Elara reads patterns. Effective psychic distance shifts during panic. However, some register drift occurs with phrases like "softly ingenious" and occasional academic intrusions. The Chinese character "缝合" appears inexplicably.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, especially in "Together, in a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer." However, several issues: the unexplained Chinese character, some overwriting ("negative image of the night sky"), and repetitive "rhythm" usage in the final section. Template cadence in "She belonged to..." sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater isolation with firefly migration creates non-obvious resonance. "Landscape Astrologer" reading ocean-surface star patterns is inventive. The specific detail of pressure-adapted fireflies transforms a familiar image. Slightly formulaic resolution keeps it from higher bands.</comment>
