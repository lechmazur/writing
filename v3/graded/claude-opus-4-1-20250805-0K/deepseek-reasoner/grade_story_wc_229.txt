<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong internal consistency with Elara's belief system driving concrete action through the lens mechanism, though the head keeper remains underdeveloped as mere volume/opposition. The protagonist's choice to beckon rather than shout manifests her core belief with embodied cost (the dropped cork), and her motivation intensifies naturally toward the transformative blue light.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the blue light transformation serving as Resonant Reconfiguration—the lighthouse's "true function" revealed through Elara's intent reshapes meaning with felt cost (the sailor's anger draining). The cork's fall creating the transformation is slightly convenient but pays off thematically; orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Fresnel lens and its mechanism constrain the central choice when the cork strikes it, transforming function. Sensory work is selective and POV-filtered (phantom perfume, vibration in teeth), though the impossible garden scent could use grounding in the lighthouse keeper's specific experience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes signal early through Elara's belief about whispers vs. shouts, with meaningful deepening when the cork transforms the light's function from warning to welcome. The trawler scene demonstrates cost through the sailor's transformation, though agency feels slightly diminished by the accidental cork drop rather than deliberate choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lighthouse's transformation from warning system to purification device, with the blue light literally embodying "whispers travel farther than shouts." The ending reweights all prior material—the cork talisman, the beckoning gesture, the lens's true purpose—without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("screaming tenderness," "cobalt tower") and clean focalization throughout. The perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices phantom scents and vibrations others might miss—though some phrases edge toward purple ("a fatigue that went deeper than bone").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery, but occasional overwriting ("vulgar shock," "fierce, quiet need") and one template structure ("It was this... It was a method..."). Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse as amplifier of intent rather than mere warning system offers fresh perspective on familiar maritime imagery. The blue light transformation and its purifying effect on human conflict feels earned through prior setup, though the coincidental cork drop slightly diminishes the boldness of choice.</comment>
