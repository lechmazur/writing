I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's rigorous standards.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - The story builds through layered imagery and sensory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Aris transforms from janitor to cosmic witness.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's spiritual curiosity manifests through concrete actions (polishing glass, tracing meteor paths) with embodied sensation during the empathic connection. The transformation from "keeper of stillness" to active witness shows earned change through specific experience. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("flourishing stillness") that occasionally replaces embodied detail.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Aris becoming "a witness, strong in his fragile humanity," showing clear before/after with emotional cost paid through the terrifying empathic experience. The accumulative structure coheres as sensory details build toward the transformative moment. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation and some abstract passages that briefly obscure the physical reality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tracking station creates atmospheric pressure through "pristine surfaces," "dead monitors," and the "colossal observation dome." The yellow glass functions as micro-setting, constraining how Aris perceives the meteor shower and enabling his empathic connection. Strong sensory hierarchy reflects his janitor's attention to surfaces and light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from aesthetic appreciation to visceral empathic connection with cosmic death—"terrifying, rapid heat" followed by "cold, peaceful dissolution." The cost manifests physically as Aris stumbles back "breathless and profoundly shaken." One meaningful deepening occurs when tracing becomes feeling, though additional pressure points would strengthen the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of finding "strength in vulnerability" via cosmic empathy. The yellow glass transforms from navigation tool to spiritual instrument without heavy-handed symbolism. The ending reweights stillness as "not an absence, but a fullness" through earned experience rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with selective perception ("dust motes dancing," "buttery, distorted squares"). POV control wavers slightly with phrases like "primal elegance" that feel authorial rather than character-sourced. Strong perceptual signature in how Aris notices light and surfaces befitting his role.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("silent song he had finally learned to hear") but suffers from abstract scaffolding ("cultivation of a flourishing stillness," "profound urge"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("keeper of stillness"/"preserve the silence"). Information density is moderate with several sentences doing single duty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a janitor achieving cosmic connection through empathy rather than technology offers fresh perspective on the abandoned-facility trope. The yellow lantern glass as astronomical instrument shows inventive specificity. The story commits to its quiet, contemplative register without retreating to conventional drama.</comment>
