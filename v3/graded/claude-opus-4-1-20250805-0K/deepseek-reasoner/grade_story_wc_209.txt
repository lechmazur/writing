<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by the mystery of night-blooming flowers tied to her grandmother's postcards. The final realization about faith and unseen connections earns the closure, though the internal conflict could be more visceral during the discovery sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered discoveries culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with conceptual cost—understanding her grandmother's artistic legacy requires faith in the unseen. The violet light discovery through specific glass angle provides strong causal linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cathedral's western window and amber pavilion effectively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, particularly the "weak, lemony light" and spectral violet. The worn flagstone discovered through light's guidance demonstrates environment shaping discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation as Elara's patient observation reveals hidden layers, culminating in the flagstone discovery. The cost is primarily conceptual—understanding requires faith like the moths'—though more visceral pressure during the physical discovery would strengthen escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between night-blooming flowers/moths and Elara/grandmother—both acts of faith in unseen connections. The final image of the planned pavilion ceiling mural for moths resonates without stating a moral, reweighting all prior searching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("ghosts of a thousand pigments," "umbral tenderness"). POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Some elevated diction ("monolith of stone and faith") fits the contemplative tone though occasionally borders on overwriting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied rhythm, though some passages tend toward density ("fractured through centuries-old silica and color"). Minor figurative excess in places ("cave of half-finished dreams") but momentum sustains through the discovery sequence. The final paragraph effectively compresses without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The connection between stained glass restoration and night-blooming flowers offers a fresh angle on artistic legacy. The specific discovery method through light refraction at a precise angle shows ingenuity, though the grandmother-granddaughter artist parallel is somewhat expected.</comment>
