<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in inherited guilt and ethical duty compels her final renunciation with visible cost. Her contradictory impulses—maintaining mechanical order above while seeking chaotic absolution below—act simultaneously throughout, culminating in the earned choice to stop the clock. The "pendulum bob rolling in the surf like a common stone" crystallizes her internal rupture between duty and freedom.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern break at closure—Elara stops rather than restores the clock, creating Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost: "a shared responsibility for the time they kept together." The pendulum bob discovery properly escalates to her renouncing her role, with "absolution...not incremental, but instantaneous" marking decisive change. Minor orientation delay (tower location unclear until "two hundred steps") prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge's "sharp-toothed surf" and "volcanic glass" create visceral danger that shapes Elara's ritual choices. The pendulum bob's weight becomes "a tangible manifestation of her failure," making environment constrain action. Tower height and ridge darkness effectively mirror internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: daily ritual → finding the pendulum bob ("profound dissonance") → dragging it from water → choosing to leave it as "monument to fallibility." The cost lands clearly: Elara forfeits her identity and purpose, forcing the village into "shared responsibility." One meaningful deepening that reweights all prior recovery work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete paradox of precise time above versus chaotic time below, culminating in "courage to finally let the pendulum stop." The rake handle's notches physicalizing guilt avoids abstraction. Final image of stillness forcing "shared responsibility" offers resonant answer without stating moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through mechanical precision language ("measured ticks and deliberate tocks") shifting to oceanic imagery. Some register elevation in crisis moments ("searing reverie engulfed her") slightly mismatches established voice. Clean POV control throughout with purposeful psychic distance shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "cold, sharp-toothed surf" and "bruised sky." Template cadence appears in father flashback ("She saw...She saw...") and some abstract phrasing ("profound dissonance," "tangible manifestation") dulls immediacy. Information density high in descriptive passages but looser in reflective sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of clock-winding profession with tidal recovery ritual creates non-obvious moral framework. The pendulum bob as both mechanical heart and oceanic refuse transforms expected symbolism. Risk in making protagonist stop rather than restore time elevates stakes, though some philosophical abstractions remain generic.</comment>
