<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leo's transformation from fearless stunt double to vulnerable witness carries genuine emotional weight, with embodied fear ("hands...shook with a familiar, deep-seated terror") and contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the final confrontation. The character's phobias are weaponized by Marcus and then reclaimed as strength, earning the final stance. Minor deduction for some abstraction in "vulnerability is power" that edges toward thesis-speak rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong causal drive where discovery of court document → finding shell → decrypting cast → reclaiming identity, with clear Decisive Change as Leo confronts Marcus armed with truth rather than fleeing. Cost is visible in trembling hands accepting fear as strength. Slight deduction for compressed middle beats that could use one more concrete step between shell discovery and cast decryption.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rusted library with peeled roof creates immediate atmosphere and constrains action to a graveyard of knowledge. Sensory details like "mother-of-pearl interior gleaming faintly in starlight" and "crunch of gravel" anchor key moments. The confined space triggers Leo's claustrophobia during the crucial decryption, making setting actively pressure choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from identity crisis to active confrontation, with Leo's phobias creating internal pressure while Marcus's arrival forces external urgency. The tightening occurs when Leo must overcome claustrophobia to decrypt the cast, foreclosing his option to remain ignorant. Cost lands clearly as he chooses vulnerable confrontation over fearless flight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of weakness into strength, with the shell and cast serving as concrete embodiments rather than symbols. The final image of Leo holding both artifacts while meeting his betrayer crystallizes the thematic question without stating it. Minor deduction for "vulnerability is power" appearing as direct statement rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third with selective perception ("cold, indifferent sky") and character-specific diction. Good psychic distance modulation from wider context to intimate fear. Some filter verb accumulation ("He remembered," "He saw") slightly dulls immediacy in middle section.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong momentum. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive "He [verb]" constructions in paragraph 4-5 and some abstraction ("transformative betrayal," "obliteration of his very self") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of a stunt double whose handler exploits his phobias while hiding his true identity offers a fresh angle. The shell-and-cast cipher system feels specific and earned. Somewhat derivative in the witness-protection-gone-wrong framework, but the vulnerability-as-power reversal provides genuine transformation.</comment>
