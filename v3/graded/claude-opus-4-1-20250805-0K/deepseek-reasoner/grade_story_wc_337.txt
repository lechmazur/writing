I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds density through layered imagery and symbolic action toward a resonant reconfiguration where the spirit finds peace.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied characterization through Elara's methodical actions and the spirit's water-dark presence. The "dialogue with the dead" through needle-work shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. Minor deduction for the spirit's somewhat convenient resolution without more visible internal struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the spirit dissolves into "serene, accumulated silence" with visible transformation cost. The accumulative structure builds through ritual unraveling to reveal buried truth (storm/rival/malice). Orientation anchored early with "mask restorer, Elara" and "subterranean sanctuary."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prism-lit sanctuary and centuries-old net constrain Elara's method meaningfully - she needs "the knot that sank him." Vivid sensory work: "spectral hues," "tar-black" fibers, "grotesque snarl." The setting's "accumulated silence" becomes both obstacle and resolution medium.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the unraveling process as "lucid unrest intensified" and temperature drops with spirit manifestation. The revelation of malice (rope cut by rival) deepens the tragedy. Cost is visible in the spirit's dissolution and the sanctuary's transformation from "heavy" to "light" silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of restoration as "providing new purpose" rather than hiding breaks. The visible stitching on the mask acknowledges rather than conceals trauma. The ending reweights the opening's "accumulated silence" from oppressive to peaceful without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled register: "her title was a kindness," "wicked tapestry needle." Strong perceptual signature in how Elara reads the net's "brutal history." Kael's dialogue carries appropriate weight and subtext. Minor repetition of "accumulated" could be tighter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density high in most beats. Deductions for "accumulated silence" appearing three times and slight overwriting in "tangled with the ghosts of ancient catches." The "sympathetic magic" explanation edges toward telling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mask restoration with spiritual grounding through physical craft. The specific method of unraveling maritime knots to release psychic ones shows originality. The visible-stitching approach to repair transforms the restoration trope meaningfully.</comment>
