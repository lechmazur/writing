I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages from Elara's discovery to her final choice.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her from quiet obsession to moral reckoning. The internal conflict between career preservation and truth-telling crystallizes effectively at closure, though the transformation feels slightly mechanical. Her specialized knowledge and methodical approach create believable agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from data anomaly to warehouse discovery to moral choice, with clear Decisive Change when Elara uploads the files. The cost (career sacrifice) is visible on page. The coordinates revelation (10.17.23) provides elegant structural cohesion. Orientation anchors establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The server cavern and warehouse settings provide atmospheric weight and necessary constraints for the plot. The embroidered patch serves as crucial physical evidence bridging digital and material worlds. However, the settings remain somewhat generic - "silent, humming cavern" lacks distinctive sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from historical curiosity to corporate conspiracy to moral choice. The pressure tightens when Elara realizes "the company would soon discover her breach," forcing immediate decision. The final uploading action carries clear professional cost, though personal stakes could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus institutional power emerges organically through concrete discovery rather than assertion. The question "where do deleted files go?" transforms from technical to philosophical, answered metaphorically in the final lines. The patch as physical remnant of digital erasure resonates without overstatement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical precision appropriate to Elara's profession - "forensic tools," "metadata," "data packet." The prose modulates effectively between clinical investigation and emotional weight. Some phrases feel overwrought ("mausoleum of status updates") but generally the register holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective variation, though several instances of overwriting: "silent, humming cavern" (contradictory), "monument to grief," "surgically removed." The final paragraph contains effective parallelism but edges toward purple with "supernova" and dual "truly, complete." Information density is moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The corporate memory keeper role offers fresh perspective on familiar whistleblower narrative. The specific detail of "10.17.23" as coordinates rather than dates provides satisfying misdirection. However, the corporate conspiracy plot itself follows predictable beats without significant transformation.</comment>
