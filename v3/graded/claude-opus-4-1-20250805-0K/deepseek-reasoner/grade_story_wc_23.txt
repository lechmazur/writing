<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "navigate the geography of loss" drives consistent choices throughout, from salvaging the censer foot to building the lunar pendulum. The internal contradiction between her "raw solace" (gift and torment) during the full moon creates genuine complexity. Minor deduction for the voice on the comms remaining underdeveloped as a pressure source.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with the moon's intensification driving Elara from passive mapping to active creation of a new navigation system. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—she's "still stranded, but no longer lost"—showing clear cost (isolation remains) while transforming her relationship to loss. The pendulum solution emerges causally from the cryptic advice to "anchor not to the earth, but to the sky."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The converted lighthouse-crawler and bog setting create immediate spatial stakes, while the censer foot's weight as "familiar comfort" links past and present worlds. The lunar pendulum system constrains her final choice perfectly. Slight deduction for the drowned cities remaining abstract rather than specifically rendered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hydraulics failure creates immediate physical stakes that escalate through the moon's painful acuity to the desperate pendulum creation. Cost is visible in her "frantic, focused energy" and the permanence of being stranded. The mysterious voice provides pressure without resolution, maintaining agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of transforming loss into understanding resonates through concrete actions—from salvaging cathedral remnants to building new navigation from "bronze and moonlight." The final realization that she's "charting the void they left behind, giving it borders and depth" offers profound thematic closure without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with phrases like "patchwork navigator" and "telluric currents" creating a unique register. The cryptic dialogue ("The river remembers its bed") carries effective subtext. Some filter verb accumulation ("She could feel," "She knew") slightly dulls immediacy in places.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the geography of loss finally had a true north." Some redundancy in describing the moon's effects and occasional overwriting ("frantic, focused energy"). The pendulum construction sequence maintains good momentum despite technical detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with spiritual navigation system. The lunar pendulum as replacement for hydraulics shows genuine ingenuity. The concept of reverse migration to map loss rather than escape transforms familiar disaster fiction tropes.</comment>
