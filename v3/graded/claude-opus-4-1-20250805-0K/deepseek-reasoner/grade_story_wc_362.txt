I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered discoveries and pattern recognition, with the frost patterns and tree revelation creating density shifts that reweight Elara's understanding.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is crystal clear and her obsession drives meaningful choices, particularly in seeking emotional residue in the frost. The internal progression from wounded pride to humble understanding earns the final stance shift with visible cost - her entire worldview expands painfully.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as Elara realizes her "small" perspective caused her to miss the vaster truth. The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward the tree's revelation, though the slightly convenient timing of the tree crack prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The quartz arbor and frost patterns directly constrain and enable Elara's investigation. The crystalline trees' humming frequency and the frost's transformation into "jagged shards of light" create vivid sensory specificity that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulation - from personal anger in frost to ancient emotions in the tree - with clear cost as Elara's certainty shatters. The tree crack provides the pivotal deepening that forces her expanded understanding, though coincidence slightly weakens agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the progression from "petty anger" to "the soul of the world" without moralizing. The final image of Elara "firmly grounded, but the ground itself had deepened" offers resonant non-literal answer to whether objects absorb emotions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with Elara experiencing the world "with her entire being" and distinctive rhythm in passages like "shifted hush." Some elevated diction ("metaphysics," "commune") occasionally strains the intimate POV but serves the mystic characterization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "truthful lie that appeared as simple ice but spoke of complex rage." Minor redundancies appear ("silent echoes," "shifting world of skepticism") and some abstract phrasing ("quality of quiet") but momentum remains strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of objects absorbing emotions gets fresh treatment through the scale reversal - from car window to ancient trees. The "truthful lies" paradox and prism-as-translation-tool show originality, though the mystical seeker archetype itself is familiar.</comment>
