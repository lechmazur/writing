I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the garden's recognition reweights all prior material.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through the marble-polishing ritual, with contradictory impulses (pragmatism vs. faith) acting simultaneously. The cracked marbles as memory-objects create specific embodiment of internal state. Minor deduction for the official's somewhat stock role, though his final response lands effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong resonant reconfiguration: the garden's shuddering recognition transforms the entire premise from luck-measurement to relationship. Cost is visible through "thorn-scars," "withered," and the years of failed cultivation. The "mended deception" reveals itself as earned truth. Slight dock for the official's convenient arrival timing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The maze functions as active constraint and metaphor, with "blooming withering" physically embodied in branches. The cracked marbles constrain choice through their ritual use. The final light constellation charges the closure image powerfully, making environment inseparable from resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from polishing to official's threat to the climactic light display. The dominant stake (proving gardens know gardeners vs. luck metrics) intensifies through the official's presence. Cost is legible in the maze's suspended state and Elara's scarred hands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the marble ritual: damage made luminous rather than erased. The ending offers a non-literal answer about quantified vs. lived experience. "The metrics measure chance. They cannot measure a conversation" crystallizes the thematic argument without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through botanical specificity and the marble-polishing consciousness. Voice modulates effectively from dry observation to transcendent recognition. Dialogue carries subtext well, particularly Elara's oblique responses. Minor dock for slight register elevation in "transcendent, impossible beauty."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "hands were a map of thorn-scars." Some overwriting in the climax ("exploded into a constellation," "transcendent, impossible beauty"). Template cadence appears briefly ("She had mended... She had let them believe"). Information density is high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cracked marbles as trophies of survival offers genuine freshness - transforming damage into light. The luck-measurement world provides non-obvious angle on determinism vs. agency. The synthesis of gardening wisdom with quantified fortune creates memorable specificity.</comment>
