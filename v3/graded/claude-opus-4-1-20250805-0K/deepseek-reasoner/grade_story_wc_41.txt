<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's precognitive forgetting creates genuine internal contradiction—he knows but cannot hold knowledge, driving embodied actions like the chalk circle and desperate listening. The final choice to continue his cycle despite understanding its futility shows earned renunciation with visible emotional cost ("A tear traced a clean path"). Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "tidal longing" which could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Silas achieves a fragment of his goal ("the faint, high-frequency whisper of a single hair turning white") while accepting the eternal cycle. The cost is legible in his tears and the final image of forever searching. Orientation anchors (junkyard, fog garden, morning) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden and rusted school bus create atmospheric pressure, with the chalk circle on metal becoming the crucial constraint for hearing the sound. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("the chill white forms of vapor twisting"). The environment doesn't quite reach 9+ because it enables rather than constrains the key choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: markers converge → chalk circle drawn → vision strikes → desperate listening → fragment captured. The dominant stake (capturing the sound of aging) tightens when the vision reveals what he seeks but immediately begins fading. Cost is visible in the tear and acceptance of eternal repetition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the paradox of knowing without possessing, with the sound of aging as concrete metaphor for time's accumulation. The final image of "forever listening for it" reweights the entire search as both achievement and loss. The "tidal" metaphor pays off in the closing line about eternal receding and swelling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through Silas's fragmented, prophetic consciousness shapes every observation ("He had seen this; he was always seeing this"). Prose rhythm accelerates during the vision sequence, then slows for the listening moment. No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice remains consistent and particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the slow crackle of a spine bending, the soft sigh of skin settling"). Some repetitive structures appear ("He knew... He would... He was") creating mild template cadence. The typo "全部 gone" and occasional abstract phrasing ("profound and aching sense") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of precognitive forgetting is genuinely fresh, creating a protagonist who is both prophet and amnesiac. The specific quest to capture aging's sound through a single white hair's frequency is memorably particular. Risk-taking in the circular structure and acceptance of futility as resolution (+0.3 within band).</comment>
