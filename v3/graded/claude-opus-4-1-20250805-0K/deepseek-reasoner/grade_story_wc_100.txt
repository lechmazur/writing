I'll evaluate this story as a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation is crystal clear—his pursuit of "chased stillness" drives every choice from initial resistance to final acceptance. The internal contradiction between exhaustion with chaos and the pull to answer the light signal creates genuine tension. His transformation from undertaker of bodies to undertaker of memory feels earned through the painstaking restoration work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain from package arrival through research, restoration, signal, and descent to the underwater library. The closure—Silas understanding this as homecoming rather than rescue—lands with conceptual cost as he accepts his grandfather's fate and his own role. The Resonant Reconfiguration transforms the distress signal into an invitation, reweighting the entire journey.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The funeral parlour's "quiet" contrasts effectively with the lens casting "frantic, shimmering spectres," and the underwater library's "marble columns draped in kelp" creates vivid specificity. The setting constrains choices—Silas must go to the coast, must descend into the deep. However, some occupational details of the undertaker's work could more directly pressure the narrative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to answer the call of the past—escalates from resistance through research, restoration, and finally descent. The cost is visible: Silas abandons his cultivated stillness to enter the depths. The reversal from "distress signal" to "invitation" meaningfully reframes the entire conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of seeking permanence in impermanence emerges through concrete images—the broken lens becoming whole, the preserved grandfather in his underwater study. The final realization that the grandfather found his "perfect, chased stillness in the deep quiet" resonates without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer to Silas's own quest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent distance with phrases like "inadvertently stubborn" and "funereal reverence" that capture Silas's particular perspective. Some moments slip into mild overwriting ("fractured prism of glass"), but the voice holds through pressure. The perceptual signature—seeing death and stillness everywhere—remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose occasionally strains with phrases like "pursuit of chased stillness" and "soul of light," creating mild register drift. Some sentences could be tightened—"He had to revitalize the lens, to make it speak its coded light once more" contains redundancy. However, the rhythm effectively modulates between the methodical restoration work and the climactic descent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of an underwater library preserved in "crystalline capsules...occupying impossible spaces" offers genuine freshness. The transformation of a distress signal into an invitation subverts expectations. While the grandfather-obsessed-with-lost-knowledge trope is familiar, the specific execution through lighthouse optics and undertaker's precision feels particular.</comment>
