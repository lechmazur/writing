Looking at this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, I'll evaluate it under an **Accumulative/Textural** drive lens, as the piece builds meaning through layered discoveries and sensory accumulation rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her transformation from investigator to participant feels earned through concrete discoveries. The internal progression from analytical distance to emotional participation works, though some moments edge toward diagnostic awareness ("inadvertent archaeologist of atmosphere"). Her final choice to add her own stone demonstrates genuine character change with visible cost—she surrenders her observer role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands effectively—Elara shifts from dissecting to participating, with the cost being her analytical distance. The accumulative structure coheres well as each discovered object deepens understanding. The "confluence" moment provides the key turn that reweights all prior discoveries. Minor deduction for slightly abstract framing in places ("creeping normality of silence").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting functions beyond description—the house's silence becomes a physical presence that constrains and shapes Elara's investigation. The orris root's lingering scent across decades and the "shard of hush" that erases ambient sound are particularly effective. The bay setting and spring timing support the renewal theme. Some descriptions lean purple ("streetlights daydreamed") but mostly serve the accumulative texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding what makes houses feel alive—evolves meaningfully from intellectual curiosity to embodied participation. The confluence moment where past and present merge creates genuine pressure that forces Elara's choice. Cost is visible in her surrender of analytical distance. The escalation through accumulating objects works under the textural lens, though could use slightly more resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through concrete discoveries rather than statement—love as a physical force that can be embedded in objects and spaces. The final image of Elara adding her stone to the mantel resonates without explaining. The concept of "sanctifying" moments through objects deepens organically. Slight deduction for one instance of thematic echo ("a house feels alive because it is loved").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with academic precision softening into emotional participation. POV control is clean throughout. Some phrases feel overwrought ("hushed blaze of devotion") and there's occasional register elevation that doesn't quite fit Elara's perspective ("sanctifying a moment"). The perceptual signature of noticing architectural atmosphere is distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has moments of genuine beauty but suffers from periodic overwriting and abstract phrasing. "Creeping normality of silence" and "inadvertent archaeologist of atmosphere" feel forced. Some template repetition in discovery sequences. The final paragraph achieves good momentum and the last line lands well. Information density is generally strong but occasional purple patches slow momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of houses storing love in physical objects offers a fresh angle on the haunted house tradition. The "shard of hush" as a physical piece of silence is genuinely inventive. The transformation of investigation into participation provides an earned twist. Some elements feel slightly derivative of object-memory fiction, but the specific synthesis feels original.</comment>
