<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to outwit cosmic tricksters drives clear, escalating choices from analysis to active interference via subsonic counter-frequency. Her cautious hope transforms believably into "something steadier" after success, though internal contradiction could be more embodied during the crucial transmission sequence. The "lockpick" metaphor and grease-stained hands ground her determination in concrete detail.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the alien signal causes division, Elara discovers its subsonic manipulation, therefore she creates a counter-frequency that dissolves the threat. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—the town's artificial division breaks, Elara's hope solidifies, and she accepts future vigilance as cost. The "balanced equation" she recalibrates satisfies closure requirements with visible relief in the town and her earned smile.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The radio station office with "organized chaos" and astronomical charts establishes professional setting early. The massive dish becomes crucial infrastructure enabling the counter-transmission. However, the town beyond "thick walls" remains generic; we never see specific divided communities or feel the fracture viscerally, limiting atmospheric pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from studying signals to discovering psychological warfare to risking everything on the subsonic counter-move. The "weight of her gamble" creates genuine tension before resolution. However, the antagonistic "tricksters" remain abstract; their threat never manifests beyond the signal itself, and Elara faces no direct opposition to her plan.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of communication as both weapon and healing emerges through the subsonic frequencies—felt more than heard, divisive when weaponized, healing when countered. The "deepest of whispers" defeating cosmic manipulation resonates without stating a moral. The balance metaphor ("balanced equation") in closure reweights the entire cosmic game as manageable rather than overwhelming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains scientific precision ("complex series of pulses," "subsonic frequencies") appropriate to Elara's expertise. Some passages drift into elevated register ("ethereal grit," "sublime science") that feels imposed rather than character-driven. The perceptual signature of tracing charts and feeling vibrations through shoe soles shows promise but isn't sustained throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with technical elements like "recalibrating the massive dish" and "piggybacking her own low-frequency transmission." However, abstract phrases like "organized chaos," "ethereal grit," and "sublime science and raw determination" feel templated. The lockpick metaphor works well, but "silent, high-stakes game" and "weight of her gamble" are stock thriller phrases.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The subsonic counter-frequency as an "audio lockpick" that jams rather than destroys offers fresh tactical specificity. Using classical music broadcasts as carrier wave shows inventive integration of setting and method. The concept of weaponized subsonic manipulation causing social division, while not entirely novel, gains originality through the specific counter-vibration solution.</comment>
