<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to translate silence into music through thermal perception is vivid and character-specific, with embodied sensory detail replacing hearing. The progression from mapping emotional frequencies to healing the Bloom shows clear internal logic. Deduction for slight over-articulation in explaining her method rather than purely embodying it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as Elara's methodical exploration builds to the Bloom's healing, with thermal patterns and tuning fork resonances creating density. The closure—restoring the Bloom through finding its "true note"—shows Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (hours of aching effort). Minor deduction for the cost being more told ("aching with cold and effort") than viscerally embodied in the final moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Winterglass Conservatory functions as both setting and constraint, with frozen specimens requiring specific thermal/vibrational intervention. Sensory hierarchy privileges thermal perception and tactile vibration over absent sound, perfectly aligned with Elara's deafness. The crack in the glass creates immediate spatial pressure that drives the climactic action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—saving the Starlight Bloom—escalates from discovering the crack to mapping its "discordant frequency" to sustaining the healing note for hours. Pressure coheres through the accumulative process of testing forks and reading thermal shifts. Slight deduction as the resolution relies on finding the "right" note rather than a more complex trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of finding music in silence, with the frozen flowers' "songs" accessible only to someone "unburdened by auditory distraction." The final image of conducting "a chorus she conducted with a silver fork and a map of warmth" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature privileges thermal and vibrational sensation over sound, with phrases like "bones of her inner ear" and "ghost of a note" maintaining Elara's deaf perspective. Prose rhythm modulates from contemplative exploration to urgent restoration work. Minor repetition in describing thermal colors reduces distinctiveness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery like "flowers that glittered like captured constellations." However, several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("unshaken marvels," "perpetual, frozen bloom") and the phrase "silently expressive" appears twice verbatim. Some redundancy in explaining Elara's method across paragraphs 3-4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of translating frozen silence into felt music through thermal mapping offers a fresh synthesis of synesthesia and preservation. The specific method of using tuning forks on ice to find emotional frequencies feels inventive. Slight deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution of finding exactly the right note.</comment>
