I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric precisely.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered descriptions of silence, creating density through the Oracle's notation system, culminating in a pattern completion that reweights the night's significance.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Oracle's motivation to map silence is concrete and drives every action, with her obsession manifesting through specific notation methods (jagged lines, blank spaces, grey smudges). Her final satisfaction upon completing the map shows earned closure, though internal contradiction could be sharper during the actual mapping process.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - the Oracle completes her life's work as dawn erases what she preserved, creating visible cost in the contrast. The accumulative structure coheres well with density increasing toward the "marbled hush" that signals the night's end, and orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort and specific sensory details (violet smear, salt-tang, sandstone fingers) create vivid atmosphere that shapes the Oracle's perception. The nightshade-and-well-water mixture constrains her method concretely, and the setting's isolation enables her silent work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as the Oracle captures increasingly complex silences, from simple notation to the "marbled hush" requiring her final definitive stroke. The dawn's arrival creates genuine urgency that forces completion, though a mid-scene complication would strengthen the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the paradox of mapping absence and preserving the ephemeral. The final image of the Oracle clutching her completed map while the documented night vanishes offers resonant commentary on art's relationship to transience without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled, lyrical diction ("ambered hush," "temporal geometry") that matches the Oracle's contemplative nature. Perceptual signature strong in how she perceives silence in visual-tactile terms, and rhythm modulates effectively from stillness to urgency as dawn approaches.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose maintains high information density with lines doing multiple jobs (describing while advancing the mapping process). Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("temporal geometry defined by the single witness") but serves the mythic register. No loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of mapping silence through visual notation is genuinely fresh, avoiding typical oracle/prophecy tropes. The specific method of translating acoustic absence into golden-book symbols, combined with the nightshade ink detail, creates memorable originality that feels earned rather than quirky.</comment>
