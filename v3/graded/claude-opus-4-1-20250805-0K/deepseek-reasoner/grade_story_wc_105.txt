<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris's obsession manifests through embodied details like "tears mix with cool condensation" and the synesthetic perception of trust breaking as "obsidian and ice." Her choice to capture absence rather than heal directly shows complex motivation, though some interior passages lean toward diagnostic language ("curse and her gift").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with sensory layering building to Aris's realization that wounds need witnessing, not fixing—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear emotional cost. The grandfather's betrayal anchors causality throughout, and the final ascent reweights the entire quest from cure to acknowledgment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abyssal setting operates as active constraint—pressure crushing the sub, thermal vents creating the narrow temporal window for collection. The sunken orchard greenhouse amid shipwrecks creates haunting specificity, while the "ashen forge under aurora" charges the grandfather's trauma site with otherworldly resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from hunting a ghost to finding the specific void, then capturing it in crystal, culminating in the recognition that healing means witnessing rather than fixing. The geothermal eruption provides the critical pressure point where absence becomes capturable, though the internal nature of conflict limits some dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of collecting absence to heal presence, with the final insight—"not meant to be fixed, only witnessed"—reframing the entire quest. The sound of trust breaking as both destroyer and potential healer avoids simple resolution while maintaining thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent perceptual signature through synesthetic details ("hears colors faintly," "leaden gray of forgetting") and technical precision about acoustic voids. The controlled, slightly detached register fits Aris's scientific obsession, though occasional moments like "battered marvel of science and grief" feel slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and sensory precision, particularly in passages like "The glass domes are shattered, and the twisted branches...frozen in a silent, perpetual scream." Some figurative density in emotional peaks ("shattering prism of obsidian and ice") and occasional abstract phrasing ("acoustic vulnerability") create minor friction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of a hearing aid designer hunting underwater for the sound of trust breaking shows genuine originality, synthesizing technical expertise with emotional quest. The synesthetic perception and the device that "filters absences" rather than amplifies sound demonstrate conceptual risk that pays off through specificity.</comment>
