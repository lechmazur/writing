<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "translate silence into music" drives concrete actions through the camera-as-instrument, with the grandfather's spirit providing layered internal conflict between teaching and loss. The final choice to map the speedboat's chaos into music shows agency under pressure with visible cost (grandfather's fading). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("fierce protectiveness rose") in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through the camera's clicking metronome and silence-to-music mapping. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara transforms chaos into "a single, clear, piercing note" that silences the boat, with cost shown through grandfather's departure. The "secret joy for a world that would never know" crystallizes the bittersweet price of her gift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The harbor setting actively shapes choices—moonlight enables the lesson, water creates the "mirror" for mapping, and the speedboat's wake provides the antagonistic force. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's synesthetic perception ("weight of silence," "pitch of stars"). The camera's brass and leather textures ground the fantastical premise in tactile reality.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving/creating music from silence escalates when the speedboat "shattered" the delicate map, forcing Elara's active choice to transform chaos rather than retreat. The cost manifests in grandfather's fading ("his work complete") and Elara's isolation with her secret. Escalation follows accumulative pattern of building musical elements to crisis and resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete practice of finding music in silence, avoiding abstract statements. The final image of "secret joy for a world that would never know it was singing" offers resonant answer to the central question of hidden beauty. "Joyful sorrow" tone earned through specific loss (grandfather) paired with creative triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic mapping ("groaning pier was a bassoon"). Voice modulates effectively from lyrical opening to urgent action when speedboat intrudes. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("fractured only by the bobbing lights") that slightly exceeds natural voice, though pattern remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("brass-bound vintage camera with no film" establishes object, history, and limitation). Some figurative density in opening paragraph without full payoff ("vast, dark mirror, fractured"). Template cadence appears briefly ("She focused... She pressed... She worked") but doesn't pervade.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of synesthesia with ghost-as-teacher creates non-obvious angle on loss and legacy. The filmless camera as musical instrument and the specific method of "mapping silence" through framing elevate beyond typical ghost story. Risk-taking in the fantastical resolution (boat engine dying from mapped music) heightens stakes while maintaining internal logic.</comment>
