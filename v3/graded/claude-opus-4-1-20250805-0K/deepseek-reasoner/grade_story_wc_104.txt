<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and embodied through physical details (raw wrist impressions, her methodical key-sorting under pressure). The moment where she chooses to jam the arrow as impediment rather than weapon shows genuine character-specific ingenuity under stress. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract final meditation on "planting resilience" that edges toward theme-speak rather than remaining fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with escalating pressure through key-sorting, militia arrival, and the door mechanism creating a resonant reconfiguration—Elara trapped but protecting the seeds. The cost is visible: her freedom exchanged for the vault's safety ("Her own prison was now the vault's protection"). The cryptic "heard not seen" setup pays off through the mental arrangement of keys as silent music.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting constrains choices effectively—the piano bench becomes the lock mechanism, the narrow doorframe enables the arrow jamming. Vivid selective details like "mildewed plush toys" and "skeletal skee-ball lanes" create atmosphere without overwriting. The vault's cool, earthy air contrasts effectively with the scorched world above.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating pressure: fence coming down → militia approaching → key-sorting under time pressure → soldier bursting in → final choice to jam the door. The cost is concrete—Elara's entrapment for the seeds' protection. One meaningful deepening as she realizes the arrow's true purpose shifts from weapon to lock.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete paradox of liberation through imprisonment, resistance through patience. The "song of resistance...played on cold, hard iron" metaphor resonates without overstatement. The final image of waiting with seeds while the world burns offers complexity without moralizing, though "plant resilience in dry soil" edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Elara's tactical awareness and pattern-recognition mindset ("listening with her mind"). Voice modulates effectively from controlled observation to urgent action. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("staggering grace," "patiently strategic") that doesn't fully match the immediate survival context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong momentum and varied sentence structures. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deduction for repetitive phrasing around "patiently strategic" and "plant resilience in dry soil" appearing three times, and some filter-verb clustering ("She could hear," "she beheld").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The arrow-as-lock rather than weapon offers genuine surprise, and the key-arrangement-as-music concept is inventive. The seed vault as both treasure and prison provides fresh complexity. Some derivative elements in the post-apocalyptic militia-versus-rebels framework prevent higher scoring.</comment>
