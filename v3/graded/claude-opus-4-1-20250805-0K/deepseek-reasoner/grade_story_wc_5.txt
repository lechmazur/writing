<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—preservation through cartographic translation—with her patience embodied through the hour-long stance waiting for aurora illumination. The internal tension between her flash-paper nature and the required stillness creates genuine character complexity. Minor deduction for the relatively safe emotional arc that doesn't risk deeper vulnerability.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the map's creation transforms dormant potential into "a patient, silent promise of spring." The closure lands with clear conceptual cost—the sublimation of collected items into permanence. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The subarctic crater setting directly constrains Elara's method—the cold stillness enables her patient work while the aurora provides essential illumination. Sensory details are selective and purposeful: "the faint crackle of the ice-laden soil," the "frozen green" aurora. The environment charges the final image as the world's "held breath slowly exhaling into a new cycle."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating the orchard's dormant life into a permanent map—escalates through accumulation from collecting items to arranging them to the final sealing ritual. The pressure coheres through textural deepening as each stage adds density. Cost is visible in the sublimation of the collected items, though the conflict lacks a sharp oppositional force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "moving stillness" and the tension between combustion and preservation. The final image of "a heartbeat sealed into a legend that was real" offers resonant synthesis without stating a moral. The map as both literal artifact and metaphor for potential life creates meaningful thematic layers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through alchemical lens—Elara notices "flash-paper" qualities, "swift conflagrations," chemical transformations. Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, though occasionally edges toward elevated diction ("sacrament," "sublimated"). The POV remains stable with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"withered orchard deep in a subarctic crater" establishes setting, atmosphere, and constraint simultaneously. Rhythm varies naturally between longer descriptive passages and shorter action beats. Minor figurative density in places ("veined with frozen green") but serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemical practice with cartographic preservation offers a fresh angle, particularly the concept of "safekept starlight" as mapping medium. The "moving stillness" paradox and the transformation of flash-paper into permanence show conceptual originality. Some familiar fantasy-alchemy elements prevent higher scoring.</comment>
