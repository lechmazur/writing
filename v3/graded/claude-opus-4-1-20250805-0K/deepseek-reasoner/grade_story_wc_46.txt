I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory accumulation and pattern intensification toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara discovers her purpose through the transformed light.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal journey from solitary seeker to lens-maker is earned through concrete action (polishing the glass) and embodied memory (grandmother's hands). The decision to "become a lens" rather than "build a beacon" represents genuine character evolution with visible cost - abandoning her solitude for community purpose.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong resonant reconfiguration as Elara transforms from earthbound watcher to active light-sharer, with the cost of surrendering solitude made explicit ("weigh this newfound purpose against her old solitude"). The accumulative lens holds consistently through sensory layering toward the crystallizing moment when light explodes through the glass.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The grotto functions as more than setting - its "serpentine" paths, mysterious fissure, and mist-filtered light directly enable the discovery. The sea glass's transformation from "dull pebble" to light-catcher grounds the thematic arc in physical specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from seeking, to remembering, to polishing, to the light's explosion. The internal conflict between keeping "quiet beauty for herself" versus sharing it creates genuine tension, though a stronger mid-story complication would elevate this.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of polishing broken things into new wholeness. The final insight - becoming a lens rather than a beacon - offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire journey without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("coastal silt," "serpentine grotto," "zephyr bloom tone"). The perceptual signature - focusing on light, texture, and geological patience - remains consistent throughout, though occasional elevated diction ("clamoring world") slightly strains the POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose maintains strong momentum with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Minor density issues in figurative language ("pearl of stillness in the clamoring world") and one instance of elevated register drift, but the closing sequence achieves exceptional clarity and propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The central metaphor of becoming a lens rather than creating fire offers a fresh angle on mentorship and legacy. However, the earthbound star-watcher archetype and the grandmother's wisdom trope, while well-executed, prevent higher originality scores.</comment>
