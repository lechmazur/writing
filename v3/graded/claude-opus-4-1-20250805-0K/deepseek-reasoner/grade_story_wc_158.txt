<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's compulsion to "photosynthesize pain into beauty" creates a clear, poetic motivation that drives the entire piece, with her final exhaustion marking genuine transformation. The internal contradiction between her need to write and inability to sleep operates throughout. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of her struggle lacking more concrete embodiment in the middle section.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure—Elara completes her poem, transforming the wind's dissonance into peace, then finally sleeps (Decisive Change with visible cost: her exhaustion). The "blossom of pure white light" provides resonant reconfiguration. Slight deduction for the convenience of immediate universal effect upon completion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell as cathedral of nacre creates vivid atmosphere, with the "off-key wind" and "half-sung lullabies" providing unique sensory texture. The shell constrains and enables her final act. Deduction for limited physical interaction with the space beyond the initial alcove placement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal insomnia to channeling "centuries of longing" into peace for all. The writing process as "exquisite wrenching" shows clear cost. However, the resolution arrives somewhat easily once she begins writing, lacking intermediate resistance or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the metaphor of photosynthesis—transforming pain into sustenance—without explicit moralizing. The "reef-shadow joy" concept and final image of the shell as monument create layered meaning about beauty knowing its opposite. The temporary nature of the peace adds complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive lyrical voice with controlled metaphorical density ("cathedral of nacre," "acid of wakeful anguish"). POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("gargantuan," "leviathan") that slightly exceeds an insomniac poet's natural voice under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery and varied rhythm. Information density is high, particularly in descriptive passages. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("quiet, persistent madness," "shyly unstoppable compulsion") and some redundancy between "centuries of longing" appearing twice in different forms.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of photosynthesizing pain into beauty through poetry offers fresh metaphorical terrain. The specific combination of elements (shell-cathedral, cosmic postcard, wind-carried lullabies) creates an original mythic atmosphere. Slightly limited by the familiar "artist sacrifices self for art" underlying structure.</comment>
