I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This story operates under a **Causal lens** - each revelation triggers the next action through because/therefore linkages (shell leads to cast, cast reveals name, name leads to film reel, film reveals truth, truth enables confrontation).

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation crystallizes through concrete discoveries, with internal conflict between fear of heights and professional identity driving choices. The twin's presence feels somewhat convenient, but the protagonist's final stance ("I'm done falling for you") lands with earned authority. Emotional progression from fear through revelation to empowerment tracks causally.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Decisive Change as the protagonist refuses their imposed role and burns the contracts, with visible cost (years of exploitation). The causal chain from seashell to rooftop confrontation holds tightly. Minor orientation wobble with the inland ocean taste, but the who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rusted library creates atmospheric pressure with "shelves leaning like exhausted acrobats" and moonlight "dripping through holes." The cast and film reel function as micro-settings that constrain discovery methods. The rooftop finale uses height phobia against professional identity effectively, though some descriptions ("stars wheeled overhead") feel ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from identity crisis through archaeological discovery to direct confrontation. The dominant stake (reclaiming authentic identity from studio manipulation) tightens as each revelation narrows options. The protagonist's phobia creates genuine tension during the rooftop climb, and burning the contracts forecloses the old life with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: vulnerability becoming power manifests in the protagonist using their suppressed fear to break free. The doubled identity literalizes exploitation, while the cast's "ink ghosts" and library's "exhausted acrobats" create resonant imagery. The final image of choosing to "land" rather than "crash" reweights the entire stunt double metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent film noir tone with effective metaphors ("stunt double to a vanished star"). Dialogue between twins feels slightly generic ("I knew you'd decrypt the cast"), missing opportunity for more distinctive speech patterns. The POV's perceptual signature focuses appropriately on motion and physical details given their profession.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from occasional overwriting ("molten silver," "trembling certainty rose in me like tide") and filter verb clusters ("I noticed," "I felt," "I understood"). Some metaphors strain ("heart hammering against ribs that had cushioned every staged crash"). However, sentence variety and momentum generally serve the story, with strong opening and closing lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The stunt double discovering they're a manufactured twin offers fresh angle on identity theft. The encrypted cast as repository of truth shows ingenuity. However, the twin's convenient rooftop appearance and the somewhat predictable studio conspiracy limit originality. The integration of film industry mechanics with personal betrayal creates specificity.</comment>
