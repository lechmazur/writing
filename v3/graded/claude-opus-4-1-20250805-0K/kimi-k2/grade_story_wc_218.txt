<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation crystallizes beautifully through the diagnosis forcing her "brazen calm" and her choice to create lasting interspecies harmony before death. The internal consistency holds as she methodically works through the diary, though the piece lacks the visceral embodied emotion that would elevate it further—her physical decline is mentioned but not felt in gesture or perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through systematic discoveries (three architectural secrets) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's death becomes transmission through the copper circuitry she laid. The cost is unmistakable in "the moonflowers opened on cue, silver petals trembling to the hush of her last breath." The lens holds consistently through pattern accumulation rather than causal turns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The temple-orchard setting functions as both environment and character, with living stone pillars that breathe and grow. The copper wire network constrains and enables Mara's choices throughout, culminating in the final image where "the pillars stood quietly, already growing the next room." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though occasionally abstract ("breathing turquoise").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation—each architectural secret raises the scope from temple to island to Mara's own dissolution into the system. The cost is legible as she "felt her own heartbeat synchronize with the slow systole of sap" while her body weakens. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks a sharp reversal or narrowing that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of interspecies treaty and transmission—"Respect is not taught but transmitted, like sap, like calcium, like song." The final image of pillars "already growing the next room" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution, embracing the complexity of creation through dissolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("her fingers tracing the copper wire she had wrapped around the ancient oak branches in a gently systematic pattern that resembled both prayer and blueprint"). Some register elevation in places like "systole of sap" slightly exceeds the established voice. No dialogue to evaluate, but the internal voice maintains consistency through mounting pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, though some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("breathing turquoise," "slow systole of sap") without clear pattern-teaching. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor template cadence in the middle section's repeated "She [verb]" constructions detracts from otherwise strong line-level craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of ecological architecture with human mortality offers a fresh angle on both death acceptance and environmental stewardship. The specific detail of copper wire as neural pathway for an island-wide organism, combined with the three architectural secrets, creates an inevitable-feeling progression. The piece takes risks with its lyric accumulation structure that mostly pay off.</comment>
