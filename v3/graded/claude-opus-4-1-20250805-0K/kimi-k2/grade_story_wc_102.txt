I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Identification**: This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through layered imagery (jasmine, fog, camera obscura, past-life memory) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mei-Ling integrates her pilgrim-self and transforms "unused love" into present warmth.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong internal contradiction between past/present selves drives the piece, with embodied emotion ("trembling," jade warming in palm, heat traveling up arm). The final integration of pilgrim and artist selves shows earned change through specific mystical causality. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("who she had failed to become") but the embodied details compensate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the integration of past/present selves with visible cost (the cracked bowl, unused love transformed). The accumulative lens holds as image layers build toward transformation. Deduction for orientation delay (who/where/when takes ~120 words to clarify) and some causality softness around the mystical mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The viaduct, jasmine, and camera obscura create atmospheric pressure that directly enables the transformation (camera as portal, jasmine responding to breath). Setting constrains choice through the specific location triggering memory. Rich sensory detail ("narcotic breaths," "violet dusk") filtered through artist's perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative deepening: memory surfaces → tear warms → pilgrim appears → touch through camera → integration. The dominant stake (healing the distance between past/present selves) tightens through mystical intensification. Cost is visible in the "cracked bowl" and "unused love" transformation, though agency feels somewhat passive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of healing as "revelation—breath by breath, image by image" emerges through concrete mystical action rather than statement. The final image of the lantern "burning steady inside her" offers resonant answer to the question of where unused love is stored. Some abstract phrasing ("the unhealed distance") but mostly grounded in specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("twilight viaduct in bloom," "barefoot pilgrim of sparks"). POV remains stable with Mei-Ling throughout. Some register elevation in mystical moments feels slightly forced ("calcified grief"), and occasional filter phrases ("She felt," "She saw") dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has moments of beauty but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Some paraphrase loops ("unused love" concept restated multiple times). Template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions. The mystical register occasionally obscures clarity ("liquid light pooling in the cracked bowl of her chest").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of camera obscura artistry with past-life healing creates non-obvious angle. The specific combination of Kwan Yin's tear, photographic inversion, and breath-work feels original. Risk-taking in the mystical register mostly succeeds, though some moments feel derivative of spiritual memoir conventions.</comment>
