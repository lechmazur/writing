I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens** based on its lyric qualities, pattern-building through repeated imagery (stone, shadow, glass petals), and the way density increases toward a resonant reconfiguration at closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and embodied through her physical interaction with the river stone ("pressed the river stone to her lips, feeling its coolness turn warm"). The internal conflict between her duty to catalogue versus her need to intervene creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("luminous regret" repeated without fuller embodiment).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the shadow is bound to the stone, reversing the metamorphosis with visible cost ("shadow was not destroyed, merely bound again"). The accumulative pattern of stone/shadow/light imagery coheres meaningfully. The cost is both immediate (Lira must remain vigilant) and future-facing (another will face this choice).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The blooming library setting actively constrains choices—glass petals darkening into wings, cloud floors that accept the stone "as if the cloud floor were water." The river stone functions as micro-setting that enables the resolution. Setting details evolve causally with the metamorphosis threat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: shadow spreading, library transforming, stakes crystallizing when Lira realizes "the building had begun to metamorphose." The tightening occurs when she must choose between recording and resisting. Cost is visible in the binding ritual and ongoing vigilance required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete interplay of preservation versus intervention, hope's fragility, and the weight of memory (stone) against dissolution (shadow). The final image of the stone whispering "every shadow contains the memory of light" offers a non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature in phrases like "first bruise of night," "hope changed color." Voice maintains lyric consistency through "softly deliberate" pacing. Some elevated diction fits the fantastical setting though occasionally approaches purple ("forgiven ghosts").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("frozen dragonflies," "talons"). Some overwriting in figurative density ("shelves of glass petals holding every reverie ever surrendered"). Minor template cadence in middle action sequences. Information density is high but occasionally tips into ornamental.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-organism with dream preservation creates an original world. The shadow-as-library's-own-silhouette twist feels earned. Some elements trend toward familiar fantasy (magical library, chosen guardian) but the specific execution and stone/shadow binding mechanism offers genuine novelty.</comment>
