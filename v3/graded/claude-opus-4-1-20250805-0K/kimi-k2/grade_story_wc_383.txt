I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through pattern, repetition, and density increase toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara integrates her mother's memory archive.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "translate isolation into independence" manifests through concrete micro-choices: pressing the shell to her ear, matching her heartbeat to its rhythm, accepting the garden's dissolution. The internal contradiction between skepticism and desperate preservation drives authentic tension, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed in the middle third.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara integrates the archive internally, with clear cost (garden's dissolution, mother's voice silenced). The accumulative structure coheres through resonance patterns and shell imagery. Deduction for slight ambiguity in the physical mechanics of the "resonance structures" mid-story.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The velvet garden functions as both setting and constraint, its dissolution creating urgency. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("petals fell upward," "bruised sky"). The garden-to-vacant-lot transformation charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the garden's impending dissolution at dawn, with Mara's quickening heartbeat intensifying the transfer. The cost is visible in the garden's collapse and the shell's final silence, though middle-section pressure could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mother's sacrifice ("chose to forget so her daughter might remember") and Mara's transformation of isolation into independence. The final line about forgetting and remembering as partners offers resonant non-literal closure without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("archive me before I burn"). The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the dissolution sequence. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds Mara's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density and varied syntax, but several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("tragically radiant" appears twice, "ghostly resolve"). Some filter-verb clustering in middle sections dulls immediacy. The final passages achieve excellent propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The quarantined memory garden as neural archive offers fresh conceptual territory. The shell-as-mind-fragment and resonance-based transfer mechanism feel specific and earned. The ending's reframing of isolation transforms familiar material meaningfully.</comment>
