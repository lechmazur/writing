I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through density of image and pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration where the protagonist understands inheritance as "permission" rather than property.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "reopen that spiral" drives concrete actions with embodied tension ("fury of the storm and the serenity of the atrium braid inside her chest"). The moment of understanding inheritance as permission rather than property constitutes earned insight through specific experience, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("texture of borrowed time").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when she understands "inheritance is not property but permission" after touching the vortex membrane, with visible cost in her careful withdrawal to prevent tearing. The accumulative lens holds as image patterns (seeds, spirals, cold/heat) build toward this crystallized understanding that reweights the opening mystery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound atrium functions as constraining setting - the cold enables her entropy-decreasing method while the cracked dome's "thin blades of wind" create atmospheric pressure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("breath crystallizing into tiny constellations"), though the setting doesn't fully constrain the key choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation occurs through accumulative deepening as she moves from arrangement to breathing technique to the vortex opening, with stakes crystallizing around not tearing the membrane. The cost appears in her withdrawal and the "slower work of sealing," though pressure could tighten more sharply.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of inheritance as permission rather than property, earned through concrete action with seeds and the vortex. The final image of "writing back to the spiral" offers a non-literal answer to what inheritance means, avoiding explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice emerges through controlled lyricism ("tiny constellations that drifted upward") and consistent perceptual signature focused on temperature, texture, and cosmic imagery. The prose modulates effectively from contemplative opening to intense vortex encounter, maintaining POV consistency throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("clutched the oak acorn cap between gloved fingers, its ridged surface warm despite the sub-zero air"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("furiously tranquil") but rhythm varies naturally and propels the narrative forward without loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The concept of "vortex inheritance" hidden among heirloom seeds offers fresh synthesis of botanical and mystical elements. The specific twist that inheritance is permission rather than property, discovered through entropy manipulation, transforms familiar legacy themes through grounded magical realism.</comment>
