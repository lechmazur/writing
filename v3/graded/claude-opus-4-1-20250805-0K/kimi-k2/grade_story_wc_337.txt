<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to release trapped souls drives consistent choices through the net-unraveling ritual, with embodied details like "salt crust bite her palms" grounding the emotion. The fisherman's concrete desire to "exhume their names before the tide of forgetting rose" creates urgency. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("centuries of unfinished mourning had pooled") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the ritual—each knot releases accumulated silence until the final transformation where spirits are freed and Lira's own mask becomes "whole." Closure lands with visible cost: "tomorrow new silences would begin to gather" acknowledges the ongoing burden. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the situation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary's "crystal walls" and "faceted ceiling" that refract grief into specters create a unique setting that enables the ritual. The net functions as micro-setting, its knots constraining the action. The starlight threading through crystal shapes both atmosphere and the literal tool (moonlight filament).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation—each knot releases more silence, making the sanctuary's hush "deepen" and walls "vibrate," building to the collective release of all spirits. The dominant stake (releasing trapped souls) tightens as Lira absorbs the fisherman's memories with each knot. Cost is visible in Lira's ongoing burden as the "broken mask restorer."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete work of untying silence—"every fracture was a doorway, and every doorway needed a threshold of truth." The final image of Lira's mask "stitched together with threads of silence set free" resonates without stating a moral. The recurring motif of knots/silence/names creates thematic depth through accumulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("tapestry needle no longer than her thumb, its eye threaded with a single filament of moonlight"). Perceptual signature shows Lira experiencing the sanctuary through her specialized role. Some elevated diction ("interlaced hush," "exhume") fits the mystical tone but occasionally strains naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of abstract phrasing weaken immediacy: "centuries of unfinished mourning had pooled," "accumulated silence hovered." Some repetitive constructions ("knot sighed open," "knot, another bead"). The prose serves the accumulative mode but could be tighter in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story and craftwork metaphor—the physical act of unknotting as spiritual release feels original. The specific detail of "moonlight filament" threading a needle and the sanctuary as prism that refracts grief show imaginative world-building. The ending transformation of Lira's own broken mask into wholeness through her work adds unexpected depth.</comment>
