I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through lyric density, pattern work (dripping rates, reversal imagery), and cadence shifts toward a resonant reconfiguration where Calen's brittle devotion transforms to flexible endurance.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Calen's internal contradiction between guilt over choosing the bell over the bosun and his devotion to cosmic balance drives authentic choices. The transformation from brittle to flexible devotion lands with earned cost through specific embodied details ("hollow tug behind his ribs"). Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("earnest and naive") rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Calen's act of naming the bosun transforms his brittle devotion into something "flexes like green wood." The accumulative lens holds through dripping patterns, mercury counting, and the final image of the bell keeping time. Cost is visible in the choice he must relive and the hair-cord sacrifice. Slight deduction for density that occasionally obscures immediate causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The viaduct setting actively constrains and enables the repair work through its keystone placement and central arch. Exceptional sensory specificity ("scales flashing once," "bronze lip cracked like a smile interrupted") filtered through Calen's mage-perception. The reversed physics (droplets rising) creates environmental pressure that drives urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the bell's widening crack responding to doubt, forcing Calen to confront his original choice. The cosmic reversal creates genuine urgency with visible consequences (fish leaping upward, rivers emptying skyward). The resolution earned through specific cost (blood, hair, naming). Minor deduction as the middle section's pacing occasionally stalls during technical descriptions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of brittle versus flexible devotion, culminating in "green wood" that "will break again...but not today." The bell's transformation from broken to "breathing" resonates without stating a moral. The final image of walking toward the emptied river while the Perseverance's bell tolls beneath reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("frozen wave at dawn," "metal seemed more loyal than flesh"). Strong perceptual signature in how Calen notices dripping rates and cosmic imbalances. Psychic distance modulates effectively during the repair sequence. Minor repetitive patterns in some sentence openings ("Calen's motivation," "Calen's hands," "Calen's devotion").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with memorable images and high information density. However, several template constructions appear ("Calen stood," "Calen had been," "He sets," "He begins") and some paraphrase loops ("brittle as spun sugar, sweet until it shatters" restates the brittle concept). The "one Mississippi, two Mississippi" counting and some filter constructions ("feels its weight shift") reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic imbalance with intimate personal guilt creates an original angle on redemption narratives. The specific method of bell repair through dripping rates and mercury timing feels inventive. The transformation from brittle to flexible devotion offers genuine insight. Some familiar fantasy-mage elements prevent higher scoring.</comment>
