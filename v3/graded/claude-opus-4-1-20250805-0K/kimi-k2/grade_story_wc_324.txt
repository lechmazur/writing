I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens - the story builds through layered encounters with the dead, each adding weight until Mara's role crystallizes. The closure arrives through accumulated testimonies rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a "contact tracer for hearts" who maps grief is clear and specific, with her curiosity driving genuine choices. The shift from mapping to active witnessing feels earned through accumulated pressure. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("incidental heroism...began exactly there") that briefly breaks embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara accepts her expanded role as witness to both living and dead, with clear cost in carrying their weight ("The last photograph in her pocket felt heavier now"). The accumulative structure coheres well, though the final sentence cuts off mid-thought, slightly weakening the landing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium creates genuine atmospheric pressure with specific sensory detail ("wet marble and old roses"). The conservatory's decay mirrors the erosion of memory effectively. Setting actively shapes encounters through the spatial choreography of Mara following signals to specific locations.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual encounter to collective need as more spirits gather, each with urgent unfinished business. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens through density increase. Cost is visible in Mara's growing burden, though the resolution feels slightly too smooth for the weight established.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of preserving erased names and stories. The photograph's transformation from single memory to collective repository ("held not just one child but all of them") resonates without stating a moral. Strong integration of memory, naming, and witness themes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with evocative phrasing ("humming against her collarbone like a second pulse"). Some register elevation in descriptive passages ("reeling hush...folding around them like damp velvet") occasionally strains against the intimate POV. Dialogue effectively carries the dead's urgency and specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery, though some overwriting appears ("mist-clad," "transparently"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition of "pulse/pulsed" and some elevated diction ("incidental heroism") that could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of technological mediation between living and dead through repurposed devices (contact tracer, WWII hearing aid) offers fresh specificity. The integration of historical trauma through the bombing raids reference adds depth. However, the ghost-whisperer framework itself is familiar territory.</comment>
