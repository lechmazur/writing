I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece. The story builds through layered imagery and metaphorical density rather than causal plot mechanics. The cartomancer's journey accumulates meaning through symbolic actions (spreading tools, tracing hands, thread of light) that reweight the central loss rather than solve it causally.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—climbing the glade, spreading ritual tools, tracing ghost-hands. The internal contradiction between fleeing and seeking redemption acts simultaneously in scene, particularly in "perplexed by how surrender could feel so much like flight." Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract treatment of guilt that occasionally drifts toward metaphysical rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the mother accepts rather than reverses her loss, with visible cost in "the two prints overlapping like a promise that time, once lost, could still be found." The accumulative lens holds consistently through imagery that reweights absence into presence. Orientation anchors (cartomancer, midnight glade, after birth) establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating glade three miles above earth constrains the ritual space brilliantly, while objects (cracked saucer, tablecloth with traced hands) directly enable and shape the mother's choices. The saucer's crack "opening like a mouth" and the tablecloth holding family history charge the final image where "two prints overlapping" resolves the separation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative density—from physical climbing to ritual spreading to the thread of light appearing to final acceptance. The dominant stake (recovering lost time with her daughter) deepens when she realizes "lost time did not accumulate in places but in absences," forcing her to accept rather than retrieve. Cost is visible but the pressure could tighten more decisively in the middle third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "time pooling in corners" and the mother seeking what cannot be retrieved. The final image of overlapping handprints offers a non-literal answer about how love fills absence without stating a moral. The cracked saucer becoming "whole enough to hold the future" perfectly embodies acceptance of damage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "starlight so thick it felt like drowning in silver," "minutes puddling under the crib." The perceptual signature remains consistent—a grieving mother who sees time as substance and absence as space. No head-hopping, and the sustained metaphorical register serves the accumulative design without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The cards whispered as she shuffled, their onyx ink shifting to show scenes that had not yet happened." Strong syntactic variety and rhythmic control. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("choking beauty" appears twice) and slight metaphor density in places, though it serves the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise of time physically pooling after childbirth loss is genuinely fresh, executed through specific details like the tablecloth tradition and cards inked with blood. The synthesis of magical realism with maternal grief feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the floating glade setting and non-causal resolution heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
