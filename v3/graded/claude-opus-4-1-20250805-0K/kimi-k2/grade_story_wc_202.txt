I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and memory toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation as a "between-worlds translator" drives consistent choices through memory, perception, and the final decision to carry stories forward rather than follow. Internal contradiction emerges when confronting childhood memory versus present duty, culminating in the earned choice to remain and translate. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("ferrying meanings too delicate") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator chooses to remain as translator rather than ascend, with visible cost in separation from sister and childhood companions. The accumulative structure coheres through the lighthouse fragment as a persistent constraint linking market-painting-memory-return. Deduction for occasional opacity in transitions (the painting scene's reality-shift mechanics) and the abrupt cutoff that leaves the final ship moment incomplete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The alchemist's market setting directly constrains movement ("swaying catwalks") and enables the central encounter. The lighthouse fragment functions as micro-setting that drives choices throughout. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("salt wind," "storm-blue pigment"), filtered through the translator's perceptual priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preserving/translating lost histories escalates from passive carrying to active participation when stepping through the painting. The lighthouse fragment's increasing warmth and the sister's boat-gift deepen pressure toward the final choice between following and remaining. Cost manifests in the separation and the "promise to return" that binds future action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of translation/preservation emerges through concrete particulars: paper boats, lighthouse fragments, painted histories. The final insight that "histories are not chains but sails" reweights the entire journey without moralizing. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "language of almost-lost things" that verges on theme-statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity ("I am seven again"). Perceptual signature clear in how the narrator notices hidden details and translates colors. The experimental compression and non-standard sentence structures ("Between childhood and now") serve the accumulative design effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in peak beats ("colors braid into a rope that lashes the lighthouse to the sky") occasionally obscures clarity. Template cadence appears briefly ("I walk...I raise...") and the abrupt ending damages momentum, though the prose otherwise maintains strong propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of market-as-memory-repository with translator-as-preserver creates non-obvious angle on loss and continuity. The specific detail of "gutters that once were rivers" and payment in "salt: One memory, truthfully told" elevates beyond template nostalgia. Risk-taking in the reality-shift through painting heightens stakes while maintaining coherence.</comment>
