<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oracle and Elias demonstrate clear internal contradiction through embodied moments—her "fault-tolerant" method of accumulating error until "contradiction can be held," his decade of filing climate data "under routine" while knowing the truth. The final handholding with space "wide enough for both confession and forgiveness" earns the closure with visible emotional cost, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("swallowed truth inside him shift, a glacial shard").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through repeated imagery (gentian, glacier, weight, margins) toward the Resonant Reconfiguration where both characters confess their silences and the station "filled with the scent of wet earth." The 4.7 grams measurement literalizes abstract guilt effectively. Orientation anchors clearly (mountain weather station, oracle arriving, Elias the meteorologist), though the piece occasionally drifts into abstract territory that slightly dulls causal linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The weather station setting actively constrains choices—instruments become confessional tools (barometer's "heartbeat unsure," anemometer in "auroral sorrow"), the tower climb forces shared confrontation. The gentian illustration's transformation from glacier memory to heart-pocket talisman charges the final image. Sensory work is selective and POV-filtered (condensation halos, carbon copy smudges), though occasional overwriting appears ("auroral sorrow" used twice).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: oracle's arrival → gentian revelation about glacier loss → shared tower climb → mutual confession → transformation. The dominant stake (confronting climate silence) tightens when Elias deliberately smudges the glacier outline, accepting revision. Cost is visible in the "4.7 grams" weight and the final atmospheric shift, though the conflict could push harder against resistance before resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the extinct gentian where glacier was, filed-away data, the weight of silence measured in grams. The ending's "scent of wet earth" after confronting loss offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question of environmental witness. Subtext operates well through gesture (smudging the glacier, rolling the illustration), though "Truth has mass only when confessed" edges toward explicit thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signatures emerge—the oracle's marginal awareness and botanical precision, Elias's meteorological framing and graphite-stained practicality. Rhythmic control mostly holds under emotional pressure, particularly in shorter sentences during the tower scene. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("auroral sorrow," "fever breaks") beyond what these characters would naturally think, and some syntactic patterns repeat ("She said," "He thought").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs (the gentian as memory/confession/transformation tool). However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("cups catching the first lavender light of dawn that never quite decided whether to mourn or begin again") and "auroral sorrow" repeats. Template cadence appears in dialogue tags ("She said," "He said," "She whispered"), and abstract phrasing like "swallowed truth" and "ghosted with frost" dulls immediacy in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fault-tolerant oracle concept offers fresh angle—someone who accumulates error until contradiction becomes bearable, applied to climate grief. The 4.7 grams literalization of silence's weight is inventive. However, the climate change guilt narrative follows familiar templates without sufficient transformation through lived detail, and some imagery (weather vane as compass, roots as questions) relies on expected metaphors.</comment>
