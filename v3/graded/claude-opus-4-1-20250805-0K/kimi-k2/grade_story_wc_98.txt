I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration where memory anchors against forgetting.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's gift of tasting stories' "pH" and "specific gravity of truth" creates a unique character-particular perception that drives every choice. Her motivation to "protect cultural memory, even if that meant doubting every luminous thing she loved" shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to bite the dream-fruit demonstrates earned agency with visible cost ("luminous doubt still flickering").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the seed's transformation into a memory-anchoring sapling, with clear cost in Mira's acceptance of perpetual doubt. The accumulative structure coheres as each forgetting flower builds pressure toward the dream-library resolution. Minor deduction for the truncated ending ("they oss") which slightly undermines the closure's polish.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ridge functions as both setting and active participant—its "moss that hummed like a sleeping lute" and "soil black with centuries of composted song" constrain Mira's choices and enable the solution. The monsoon's approach creates temporal pressure that shapes tactics. Sensory details filter through Mira's reality-checker perception, making the fantastical tangible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from flat-tasting tales to the orchid's dragon-spine vision to the dream-library's browning pages. The monsoon countdown creates external pressure while internal stakes deepen as Mira must summon witnesses within her dream. Cost is visible when she bites the knowledge fruit and accepts belonging over certainty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between memory and forgetting, crystallizing in the final image where "even protected memories must be questioned." The knowledge fruit's transformation from seed to library to edible truth creates a non-literal answer about how collective memory requires both preservation and doubt. No explicit moralizing; the paradox remains productively unresolved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with distinctive constructions like "empirically whimsical" and "the taste of every tale had gone flat, like watered wine." The perceptual signature of tasting narrative truth stays consistent throughout. Slight compression under dream-pressure ("Heat flowed, a communal pulse") serves the accumulative mode without breaking voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "petals were beginning to forget their lines" merges literal and metaphorical. Some figurative density in peak beats ("raindrops the size of lullabies") but pattern-taught early and pays off. The truncated final word "oss" appears to be a typo rather than intentional, creating a jarring end-note.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of a "fantasy reality checker" who can taste stories' truth offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of botanical imagery with library/memory creates non-obvious connections that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking through the dream-within-dream structure and the paradoxical ending enhances rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
