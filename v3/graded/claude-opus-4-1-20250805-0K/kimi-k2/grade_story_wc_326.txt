I'll evaluate this story systematically through each category.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interiority with concrete embodiment of the death/non-death paradox through pulse counting. The protagonist's transformation from "corrupted code" to integrated identity earns its arc through specific actions (tracing patterns, stepping into vortex). Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution of the identity swap backstory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (heartbeat counting, ink patterns, mandala formation) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where "identity is not a file to be deleted but a pattern to be completed." Cost is visible through heartbeat depletion (120→100) and the protagonist accepting both stories. The orientation anchors (opal observatory, death certificate context) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The opal observatory setting constrains choices through the inkwell room's specific materials enabling the defragmentation ritual. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (ink as "liquid night," snow as metronome). The porcelain shard and ink function as micro-setting that directly shapes the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the heartbeat countdown creating urgency, with the dominant stake being identity resolution. The protagonist's agency drives the defragmentation through deliberate actions (tracing patterns costs heartbeats). One meaningful deepening occurs as understanding shifts from deletion to rearrangement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the defragmentation metaphor—identity as pattern rather than fixed file. The final image of the observatory becoming "a lantern of midnight solace" resonates without stating a moral. The wisdom "fetched from failure" arrives through concrete experience of the identity error.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and perceptual signature ("counting out loud because the death certificate had insisted I had none"). The experimental compression and metaphorical density serve the accumulative pattern. Minor filter verb clustering in middle section prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with purposeful rhythm variations, though some metaphorical density in peak beats ("porcelain kissed porcelain") slightly obscures immediacy. Template cadence appears briefly in the "I + verb" pattern mid-story. Strong opening and closing lines that bookend the transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital ghost concept with physical ink/porcelain ritual creates non-obvious angle on identity. The death certificate error premise transforms through specific details. The defragmentation-as-mandala-drawing is inventive though the resolution tends slightly toward safety.</comment>
