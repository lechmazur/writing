<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to restore joy is embodied through concrete actions (breathing on film, guiding light) with internal conflict shown via her hesitation about "brightness like a debt." The final choice to leave the painting despite gathering fog shows earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (cherub→light→painting→transformed orchard) with Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where the painting continues glowing "a small defiance against forgetting" while fog gathers—visible cost in the impermanence. The piece anchors who/where/when early and maintains coherent causality through the daydream fold mechanism.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ruined orchard transforms through Liora's perception, with sensory details (rose-gold light, scent of cider, sound of bees) constraining her artistic choices. The fresco fragment functions as micro-setting that directly enables the painting method and charges the final image when it "winked, its paint finally fading."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation through accumulative deepening: from touching fragment→projecting light→painting with sunbeams→orchard resisting ("branches creaking warnings")→final transformation with "real blossoms from trees that had been dead." The cost is legible as fog "already gathering again at the edges" shows the temporary nature of restored joy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of lost joy's recovery emerges through concrete imagery rather than statement, with the cherub's fading paint serving its purpose creating resonant exchange—joy transferred but not permanently held. The final image of "light after light, until every lost laugh found its way home" offers non-literal answer about cyclical restoration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic rendering ("painting the scent of cider and the sound of bees") and controlled psychic distance shifts during the daydream sequence. Voice maintains lyric consistency through purposeful compression, though occasional elevated diction ("pensive mirth") slightly strains the intimate register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the fragment both glimmers and projects light for painting). Some register drift into elevated diction ("fold around her like warm cloth," "halftones") and minor template cadence in the ending sequence ("Liora would be gone...And so the cycle would continue") reduces momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art restoration with literal light-painting creates non-obvious angle on memory recovery. The daydream-fold mechanism and knowledge network of past inhabitants offer specific transformation of familiar "lost paradise" material, though the cyclical artist-wanderer ending feels slightly templated.</comment>
