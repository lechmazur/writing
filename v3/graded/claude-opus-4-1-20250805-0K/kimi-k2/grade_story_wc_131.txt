<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to preserve memory and become visible drives concrete actions throughout, with internal contradiction between isolation and connection need. The final moment where she enables connection between the runaway and the custodian's voice shows earned character agency with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "visibility" early on that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through sensory detail and memory fragments toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira realizes "visibility travels in both directions." The closure lands with emotional cost as she experiences the girl's tears as her own. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crawl space architecture constrains every movement and choice, from counting joists like braille to choosing the philosophy section's hollowed beam. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lira's priorities—touch and sound over sight in darkness. The pipe chases as "arteries of memory" transforms setting into active story element that enables the core action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal quest (finding the fragment) to enabling connection for another lost soul, with Lira sacrificing her collected treasure. The power outages create time pressure and opportunity windows. Cost is visible when she gives up "lullaby II" she just secured, foreclosing her plan to wait for seven fragments.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of invisible labor preserving human connection emerges through concrete actions—Lira collecting voice fragments of someone who once noticed her. The ending reweights "visibility" from being seen to enabling others to feel seen. No explicit moralizing; the custodian's "You are not alone" carries thematic weight through dramatized moment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout—Lira experiences the world through touch ("palms gliding over joists"), magnetism, and vibration rather than sight. Rhythm modulates with action, from methodical crawling to urgent fragment retrieval. The single line of dialogue lands with perfect subtext through the floorboard.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong sensory prose with lines doing multiple jobs ("joists she had memorized like braille" establishes both familiarity and touch-based navigation). Some figurative density in places ("sapphire hush" appears 3 times) but serves pattern. Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "She [verb]" openings across 3-4 lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of urban exploration with magnetic memory storage in abandoned infrastructure. The concept of voice fragments persisting in copper wire offers non-obvious angle on preservation and connection. Risk-taking in the technical premise (ferromagnetic ghosts in telephone wire) heightens stakes while maintaining emotional truth.</comment>
