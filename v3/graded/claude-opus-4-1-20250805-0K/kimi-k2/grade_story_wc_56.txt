<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a legend seeker drives consistent choices throughout, with internal contradictions between dismissing "mystic fluff" and later embracing it. The final choice to cut the rope and step through the glass carries visible cost (severing her tether to reality). Minor deduction for the slightly abstract epiphany about living inside lies, though it's embodied through the mirror sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (sundial spinning backward, maps forming spiral) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara enters the architecture of lies she sought to understand. The closure lands with clear cost—cutting her tether to reality—and the final image of the sundial pointing forward reweights the entire journey. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of the cartographer's statement, though the physical transformation compensates.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The canal setting constrains choices (water that "holds, tensioned like a drum") and the houseboat's maps become active tools forming the spiral path. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("moonlight lick the gnomon," "smell of salt and old promises"). The setting transforms from passive backdrop to the literal architecture Elara must navigate, with the black glass hatch as the threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: sundial pointing backward → maps forming spiral → walking on water → finding the hatch → confronting mirrors of herself. Each discovery tightens the vortex pulling Elara toward understanding. The cost manifests in cutting her tether and stepping through glass into a transformed reality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of mapping lies versus mapping truth, with the final realization that "every map is a promise waiting to be broken." The sundial's transformation from pointing backward to forward after Elara accepts living inside lies offers a non-literal answer to the central question. The mirror sequence showing her at every age deepens the theme without stating it explicitly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric compression ("twilight barge canal lay still," "water forgets direction"). POV remains stable with Elara's perceptual signature filtering observations through her legend-seeker lens. The prose modulates effectively from contemplative opening to the intense mirror sequence, though occasional elevated diction ("architecture of lies") slightly strains the register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong sentence-level craft with varied rhythm and purposeful compression. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("the pocket sundial warm in her palm" establishes object, temperature, possession). Minor deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("serene upheaval," "hindsight clarity") and one instance of elevated register drift, though these don't touch the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography-as-deception with the concrete mechanics of sundial navigation and paper-rope tethering. The concept of walking on water to enter a map's center, then cutting free to join the mapped reality, feels inevitable yet surprising. Risk-taking in the surreal elements heightens stakes while maintaining clarity through physical anchors.</comment>
