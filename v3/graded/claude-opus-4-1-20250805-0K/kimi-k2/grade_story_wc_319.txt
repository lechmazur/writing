I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guardian's contradictory impulses—duty to boundary-keeping versus loneliness for its library—act throughout the scene, culminating in the earned choice to invite uncertainty rather than enforce rigid boundaries. The child-absence/acolyte transformation effectively reveals character through embodied stress ("fur steaming where warmth met frost"). Minor deduction for the acolyte's motivation remaining somewhat abstract despite the concrete pendant exchange.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when the guardian transforms from rigid boundary-keeper to one who "invited uncertainty to tea," with visible cost in releasing the pendant and accepting dimensional distance from its library. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details ("frost patterns rearranged into unfamiliar alphabets") and metaphysical shifts accumulate toward the reconfigured stance. Minor opacity around the child-absence's initial nature slightly dulls early causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen garden constrains choices throughout—the guardian must wait between marble lions, frost limits movement, crystallized herbs withhold scent until thaw. The setting actively participates in closure when "rosemary twigs released their captive scents" signals the transformation. Spatial choreography remains coherent as the child-absence approaches, sits, and departs through consistent landmarks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from boundary protection to existential choice about certainty itself, with the pendant's oscillation ("lighthouse unsure whether to warn or welcome") marking rising pressure. The guardian's agency drives the transformation through accepting the echo-key and darkening the pendant. Cost is visible in the library remaining "one degree closer" but still dimensionally separated—a meaningful trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the guardian's method of "interiorizing exteriors" becomes the story's answer to rigid boundaries, suggesting permeability over enforcement. The final image of uncertainty "curled" beside the guardian resonates without stating a moral. The echo-key perfectly embodies the paradox of presence through absence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout—the guardian reads night "like a palimpsest" and experiences the garden as sentences and semicolons. Voice maintains lyric consistency even under pressure, with controlled rhythm in "Together they waited, two silhouettes stitched by vapor." Dialogue carries appropriate subtext ("I nibble its edges so it may breathe") without over-articulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("frost's silver script across shoulders that had carried whole shelves"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("membrane becoming drumskin") occasionally approaches overwriting but remains pattern-consistent. Minor template cadence in "The guardian [verb]" constructions across several paragraphs prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of library guardian as boundary-keeper who learns to "nibble certainty's edges" offers genuine freshness. The child-absence/acolyte transformation and echo-key feel inevitable in hindsight while avoiding predictability. Risk-taking in the metaphysical premise and lyric execution heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
