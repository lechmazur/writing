<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The boy's internal conflict between fleeing and "Stay" drives authentic tension, with embodied fear ("eyes wide as harbor mouths") and the ferry guides' patient wisdom creating genuine character pressure. The transformation from broken leash to light-thread lacks some causal grounding but lands with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through ritual elements toward the boy's transformation. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the stone's warmth births the light-thread, though the mechanism feels slightly convenient. Cost is visible in the boy walking forward "without looking back" - a path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway constrains movement through "indirect routes, switchbacks of shale" that force internal navigation. Setting actively shapes the journey's spiral inward pattern, with the bell-shaped stone at center serving as transformation catalyst. Fog and lantern-light create lived atmosphere that charges the final dawn image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on accessing "unused courage" after escape from constraint. The spiral journey inward creates accumulative pressure, though the transformation moment itself lacks resistance - the stone simply warms when touched. Cost appears in leaving the guides behind, but agency feels slightly passive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the pattern of broken constraints becoming new forms of connection - leash to light-thread. The guides' fragment-stories build resonance about transformation through loss. Final image of guides carrying "rhythm in their bones" while descending reweights the cyclical nature of guidance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("gently persistent rhythm of waves that refuse to forget the moon"). POV maintains mystical distance appropriately, with selective perception ("eyes wide as harbor mouths"). Dialogue carries ritualistic weight without feeling stilted, especially Mara's "you must first traverse yourself."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves lyric density with purposeful repetition ("gently persistent," "indirect routes") that teaches pattern. Strong figurative coherence throughout ("lanterns swaying like slow metronomes," "light pooling like spilled milk"). Some slight redundancy in the guides' return journey description, but momentum sustains.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry/crossing mythology with psychological transformation of "unused courage." The concept of courage gone "feral" hiding in ribs offers original angle. Specific details like the star-stamp punch and broken leash elevate beyond template journey narrative, though the transformation mechanism itself feels somewhat expected.</comment>
