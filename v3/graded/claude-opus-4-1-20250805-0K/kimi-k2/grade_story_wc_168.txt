<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal journey from guilt to self-forgiveness is earned through concrete embodied moments—the moth on her scarred cheek, pressing fingers to her scar as "text rather than shame." The contradictory impulses (keeping everything safe vs. accepting fire sees everything) create genuine tension that resolves with visible cost in her release of innocence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from physical journey to ritual to transformation, with the moth dissolving into "forgive" as the decisive reconfiguration. Cost is legible in "the debt now a bridge" and the reframing of innocence as "lent" rather than lost, though the mechanism of pain-to-color translation edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge, wind-sculpted pines, and frost-silvered gravel create atmosphere while the porcelain box's "lightning veins" and warm stone constrain the ritual's placement. Setting doesn't fully drive choice but the ridge-to-valley descent mirrors the emotional arc effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from walking to kneeling, opening the box, speaking aloud, then releasing colors that spell "forgive." The dominant stake (translating guilt into universal language) deepens as memory ignites and pain becomes prism, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pain-as-prism metaphor and the reversal of the bargain (innocence lent, not lost). The final image of Mara greeting planets "fluent at last in their ancient, wordless tongue" resonantly answers the central question of translation without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout—"ridge path wound...like a scar," "tongues of flame," colors as auroras. Rhythm modulates from measured walking pace to accelerated ritual beats, with controlled compression during peak moments like "fire sees everything."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong figurative language occasionally tips toward overwriting ("colors into the air...rose like auroras, soft ribbons against the hard black sky"). Some abstraction in the pain-translation mechanism and mild template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions, but momentum and clarity remain intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of firefighter's guilt with cosmic translation feels specific and earned, particularly the ash moth emerging from childhood diary pages. The pain-as-prism concept and reversal of the innocence bargain offer fresh angles on trauma and forgiveness.</comment>
