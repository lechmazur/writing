I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through layered memory, shadow measurement, and the revelation of collective grief, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira accepts the unwanted past and the obelisk transforms into a memorial page.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's internal conflict between choosing/excluding memories manifests through concrete actions—measuring shadows, pressing against the crystal, writing the suppressed plague memories. Her choice to embrace the painful past shows contradictory impulses acting in scene with visible cost when she tears the page and transforms the monument.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The accumulative structure builds coherently from isolation through memory-gathering to the discovery of the black obelisk representing suppressed trauma, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira integrates the excluded grief into the archive. The cost is legible when "She realized that identity was not sculpted like marble but [woven from what chose her]" and the fog fractures, showing connection restored through accepting pain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory and crystal whispering forecourt create a liminal space between sealed mountaintop and vanished city, with rain-droplets clinging "like memory refusing to fall" constraining Lira's archival choices. The black obelisk's impossible shadow "stretching beyond the colonnade and over the cloud abyss" charges the final transformation when it becomes a memorial page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from archiving selective memories to confronting collective trauma when the thirty-three stone shadow reveals the suppressed plague year. The deepening pressure forces Lira's choice between comfortable curation and painful completeness, with cost visible when she writes "the weight of unmarked coffins" and the monument transforms.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shadow-measuring system where "length corresponded to the weight of memory," crystallizing in the realization that "sculpting identity from experience was not an act of carving but of listening." The final image of the obelisk becoming a page crowded with names offers a non-literal answer about collective memory requiring acknowledgment of grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistent elevation with selective perception ("summer-quill archivist," "pearl-gray shell") though occasionally drifts toward abstraction. The perceptual signature shows in how Lira notices shadow lengths and translucent script, but some passages like "preemptively nostalgic for the moment she was still inside" strain credibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("Each droplet clung to the carved constellations like a memory refusing to fall") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract drifts. The unfinished final sentence reads as intentional ellipsis but weakens closure impact. Some redundancy appears in memory descriptions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of an archivist choosing which memories survive while isolated above a fog-sealed city offers fresh perspective on collective trauma. The shadow-measurement system as memory-weight metric and the black obelisk as suppressed history demonstrate genuine originality, though the incomplete ending prevents full realization.</comment>
