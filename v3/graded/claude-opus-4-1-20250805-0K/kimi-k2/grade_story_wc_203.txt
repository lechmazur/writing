I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This story operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens. The narrative builds through layered imagery (dust patterns, mirrors, reflections), sensory accumulation (frost, vibrations, temperature), and pattern recognition rather than strict causal chains. The closure arrives through density increase and symbolic reconfiguration rather than plot resolution.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as "reluctant ghost-seer" drives consistent choices through embodied sensation (chill, frost, warmth). The final choice to place the mainspring barrel shows earned agency with visible cost ("stepped out of her own skin"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("weightless burden of knowing") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where placing the mainspring transforms the space and releases both ghosts and protagonist. Cost is legible in "stepped out of her own skin and found it still fit" and her departure from her profession. The accumulative lens holds throughout, though some middle passages meander slightly before the powerful ending sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric specificity: "dust seemed to pause mid-fall," "particles had drifted into crescents and spirals." The circus setting actively constrains choices (narrow shaft of mirrors, cavity for the barrel). The dust patterns function as both setting detail and plot mechanism, directly enabling the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: frost message → dust patterns → ceiling warmth → mirror revelations → final transformation. The stakes deepen from investigating ceilings to confronting time itself. Cost manifests in Mara's permanent transformation and career abandonment, though middle sections could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of time, performance, and witnessing ("THANK YOU FOR ATTENDING"). The mainspring measuring heartbeats vs. hours elegantly unifies mechanical and emotional registers. Final image of dancing dust motes to silent music resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "dust obeyed gravity but remembered every disturbance." POV maintains consistent limited perspective with selective perception fitting Mara's technical expertise. Rhythmic control especially strong in the climactic mirror sequence and denouement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with moments of exceptional density ("frozen applause," "taught the spring inside measured heartbeats instead of hours"). Some overwriting in metaphorical passages ("weightless burden," "façade of skepticism like thin ice") and occasional register elevation that strains the technician's voice. Final incomplete sentence reads as intentional ellipsis.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story with technical profession creates non-obvious angle. The mainspring as time-compression device and mirrors showing temporal selves demonstrate genuine ingenuity. Dust-reading method is particularly original. Slightly derivative in the abandoned circus setting choice.</comment>
