I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This operates under a **Hybrid** lens - beginning with Causal elements (Lin discovers film, Mara arrives with explanation) then shifting to Accumulative/Textural for the broadcast sequence and collective transformation. I'll judge closure under the Accumulative lens as it dominates the ending.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lin's motivation to "transpose life into a new key" drives consistent choices from fortune-writing through broadcast decision. The shift from passive keeper to active broadcaster earns its arc through discovered agency. Internal contradiction between duty and desire for change manifests in concrete actions. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "open secrets" concept.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure as the lighthouse transforms from spy post to public broadcast station, with visible cost (exposure of secrets, system disruption). The hybrid lens holds - causal discovery leads to accumulative broadcast effect. Who/where/when anchored early. Deduction for incomplete final sentence and slight mechanical feel in the revelation sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-listening-post conceit grounds the story physically while the Fresnel lens becomes a literal/metaphorical reading device. Sensory detail strong in lamp room sequences. The physical transformation of the lighthouse into broadcast station constrains and enables the final choice effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal stagnation to systemic change as Lin moves from passive fortune-writer to active broadcaster. The pistol moment provides genuine pressure. Cost is visible in the mainland's reconfiguration. However, Mara's quick conversion feels slightly under-motivated despite the tears detail.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "open secret" concept elegantly bridges espionage and public confession, earning its thematic weight through the broadcast's collective effect. The final image of the lighthouse as "conductor's baton" resonantly reweights all prior fortune-writing. Strong emergence without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical register ("twelve-bar blues of fog"). POV stable throughout. Some register elevation in places ("cryptic fortune cookie writer," "trafficked in open secrets") but mostly consistent. The incomplete final sentence disrupts rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum through discovery and confrontation beats. Information density high in revelation sequences. Deductions for the truncated ending, occasional abstract phrasing ("familiar enigma"), and some template structures in the broadcast effects paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse-keeper and spy fiction with the fortune-cookie dead-drop system. The transformation of espionage infrastructure into public broadcast system offers genuine originality. The specific detail of "rice paper in shells" and "polarized moonlight" reading adds texture.</comment>
