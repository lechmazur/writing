I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered discoveries, recurring patterns (117), and sensory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara transforms from keeper to wanderer.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation crystallizes through embodied discovery—her "brightly attentive eyes hunting" shifts to tactile engagement with the patch "warm against her palm." The contradictory impulses between protocol and personal need manifest in her choice to lie about the discovery. Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("heart beat the same rhythm") rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns compound—117 appearances, layered songs, the patch's warmth—building to Mara's transformation from archivist to wanderer carrying encrypted memory. Cost manifests in her abandonment of position and certainty ("she did not know where deleted files truly go"). Slight deduction for the abrupt final line cutoff and some causality opacity around how the patch stores data in metallic threads.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The archive setting actively constrains and enables—cold aisles guide movement, server rack 117 provides direction, the offline reader allows secret viewing. Exceptional integration of micro-setting: the patch transforms from evidence to storage device to talisman. The "nest of blankets between humming towers" grounds Mara's transgression spatially.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating pressure: 117 patterns → Leo's voice → evidence locker → video revelation → decommission deadline. The dominant stake (finding truth about the vanished crew) tightens when Mara discovers "the corporation had deleted the crew to protect the algorithm." Cost appears in her choice to abandon her role, though the corporate opposition remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete question of "where deleted files go"—both digital and human erasure. The final image of Mara as wanderer "trading the patch for stories" offers a non-literal answer: memory persists in song and story. The recurring lullaby transforms from comfort to clue to preservation method without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric compression with effective rhythm modulation ("The archive hummed like a hive whose queen had vanished"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("swallowed starlight like a throat") fits the heightened discovery. Deduction for occasional filter clustering ("she noticed," "she understood," "she knew") and the ambiguous final line truncation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong moments of compression ("the silence that tasted of sensed absence") but hampered by repetitive structures ("she + verb" patterns), particularly in the middle section. The paraphrase loop around "forgotten songs" appears three times. Information density varies—some lines do multiple jobs while others merely transit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of digital archaeology with human loss offers fresh specificity—the corporate memory keeper becoming keeper of actual memory. The 117 pattern as both checksum and heartbeat, the patch storing data in metallic threads, and songs as data transport show inventive world-building. Some familiar dystopian corporate elements prevent higher scoring.</comment>
