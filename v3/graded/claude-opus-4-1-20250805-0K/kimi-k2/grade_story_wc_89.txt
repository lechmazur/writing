I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ayla's motivation to resurrect her sister drives clear, embodied choices through the metamorphosis. The internal contradiction between maintaining humanity and accepting transformation plays out in scene ("skin prickling as if every pore debated"). However, the sister-spirit's characterization remains thin, existing mainly as catalyst rather than presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Ayla's transformation enables eternal guardianship with visible cost ("no longer entirely beast, no longer entirely whisperer"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the final image. The fortune's prophecy "What dies together must change together" pays off through enacted metamorphosis with clear before/after.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orchard setting actively constrains choice through its "trees whose trunks were braided from memories" and petals that form the ritual space. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("cinnamon from comet tails, cardamom ground under sleeping dragons' tongues"). Setting doesn't quite reach 8+ because the environment could pressure tactics more directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as the metamorphosis progresses ("fur of starlight slid across her arms") with clear cost at each stage. The choice between keeping human form versus securing the sister's presence creates genuine tension. Agency drives the transformation, though the single-beat structure limits reversal opportunities.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the enacted transformation rather than statement. The final line "What dies together must change together, and in changing, never dies at all" reweights the entire piece without moralizing. The concept of bonds transcending death through willing sacrifice resonates through concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct mythic voice with controlled diction ("petals of impossible fruit opening like slow eyes"). However, register occasionally drifts toward overwrought ("cosmic intimacy of shared childhood") and some constructions feel artificial ("counting beats like stars"). The POV maintains consistency but lacks the perceptual signature that would elevate to 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from density issues with figurative language in nearly every sentence without clear pattern-teaching ("ribbons of gold and indigo, threading through moonlit blossoms until the air itself became a loom"). Several mixed metaphors blur clarity. Information density is high but momentum drags through overwriting, particularly in descriptive passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of trading human form for spirit companionship offers a fresh angle on grief. Specific details like "cinnamon from comet tails" create originality. However, the mythic register and transformation narrative echo familiar fantasy patterns without sufficient transformation to reach higher bands.</comment>
