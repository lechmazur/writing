I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through layered imagery, metaphor accumulation, and pattern recognition rather than causal plot progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as a cartomancer mapping cultural collapse is clear and consistent, with her "steadily curious" trait driving concrete actions like measuring the loft and arranging cards. The internal contradiction between preserving dying practices and accepting their transformation plays out through embodied gestures. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("the inherited mystery was this") that could be more grounded in sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively as Mara discovers value hasn't disappeared but migrated into "gestures, jokes, tattoos, recipes." The accumulative structure coheres through the measuring tape's transformation from commerce tool to mapping instrument, with visible cost in her descent carrying "measured darkness." Who/where/when anchored early through "rain-beaded skylight loft above the abandoned stock exchange."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight functions as both setting and lens, literally inverting the city view to reveal "barter networks glowing like bioluminescent veins." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"wet paper and ozone," rain as "slow-motion trades." The measuring tape and cards constrain choices throughout, with the skylight's distortion charging the final revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation as Mara's mapping reveals not loss but "relocation" of value, with the dominant stake being cultural comprehension after collapse. The tension between measuring/containing versus accepting fluidity creates pressure. Cost is visible in leaving the cards as "compass" for others while carrying only "measured darkness"—though the emotional price could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of mapping ruins to find "the blueprint of longing." The measuring tape's evolution from commerce tool to cultural compass avoids explicit moralizing. The final image of the city "recompiling itself in silence, one wet footprint at a time" offers a resonant answer about value's persistence through transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm—"rain-beaded," "onyx-ink," compound constructions that mirror the layering theme. POV remains stable with Mara's perceptual signature evident in how she reads patterns in everything. Minor register elevation in places ("micro-narrative of liquidity evaporating") fits the cartomancer's analytical mindset though occasionally verges on over-literary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with lines doing multiple jobs—"rain distorted the inches into trembling silver rivers" works visually, thematically, and atmospherically. Some overwriting in metaphor density ("ticker symbols," "black stars that drank the lamplight") and occasional abstract phrasing ("the inherited mystery was this"). Template cadence appears briefly with repeated "She [verb]" constructions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of financial collapse with cartomancy creates a fresh angle on post-capitalism fiction. The specific detail of futures contracts becoming divination cards transforms both elements. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and the abstract measuring/mapping conceit heightens meaning while maintaining clarity through concrete anchors.</comment>
