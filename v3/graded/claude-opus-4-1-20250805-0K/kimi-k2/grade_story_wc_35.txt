I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication.

**Drive Lens Inference**: This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through sensory memory work, culminating in the transformation of stored remorse into bearable salt flowers.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation through memory-taste is viscerally embodied and consistent. The internal conflict between preserving and transforming pain drives genuine choices. Minor deduction for the lord's transformation feeling slightly unearned given the twenty-year gap.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where crystallized grief transforms into "salt flowers" that can be borne. The cost is visible in both Lira's absorption of pain and the lord's twenty years of suffering. The accumulative texture coheres beautifully through the memory-cooking process.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The coral pavilion constrains and enables the central transformation, functioning as both setting and tool. Sensory hierarchy through taste dominates appropriately for a chef-protagonist. The tidal pool analysis and coral's physical transformation charge the closure powerfully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through deepening engagement with memory—from tasting rain to full subsumption to crystallization. The cost accumulates in Lira's body ("threatening to drown her") and the lord's decades of grief. One meaningful deepening executed with precision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the cooking/digestion metaphor for processing trauma. The final image of salt flowers labeled "forgiven" offers resonant resolution without moralizing. Subtext operates beautifully through the guards' borrowed sorrow and the pavilion's gratitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through taste-focused narration ("pressed her tongue to the air"). Lyric compression serves the accumulative mode perfectly. The syntactic control during Lira's subsumption sequence ("At once she was the lord") heightens pressure without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("sandstone walls steaming like fresh bread"). Some minor repetition around "remorse" and "memory" but largely justified by the accumulative pattern. The prose propels through sensory specificity rather than action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise of a chef who processes memories through cooking is genuinely fresh. The synthesis of culinary and emotional work feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric mode and sensory focus heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
