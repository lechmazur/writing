<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Nadia's motivation as reluctant caretaker is clear and rooted in obligation, with concrete micro-choices (gathering blueprints, cracking the nut, guiding hikers) that reveal values under pressure. The internal conflict between staying and leaving manifests through action rather than declaration. Her final choice to walk away "leaving impressions everywhere" shows earned change with visible cost—she abandons the orchard but marks her departure permanently.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where Nadia's departure reweights all prior material—the nut releases smoke, she exhales grandfather's works, and leaves moonlight footprints after never touching the cliffside. The lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks. Cost is legible in the transformation from cautious non-touching to leaving impressions everywhere. Minor orientation wobble with the labyrinth's spatial relationship to the orchard slightly unclear.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cursed orchard with its hissing fruit and rasping branches creates immediate atmosphere, while mechanical birds with typewriter wings add textural specificity. The cliffside labyrinth's "corridors of shale and lingering salt" grounds the space physically. The nut's pearl varnish and "dropped heartbeat" sensation provides tactile detail that constrains Nadia's final choice. Setting actively shapes action through frost timing and the phantom bridge creation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—saving the hikers before frost seals everything—creates clear time pressure that forces Nadia's action. Escalation occurs through the nut's oil creating the bridge, birds growing frenzied, and the final cost of leaving permanent impressions after maintaining distance. The resolution is earned through Nadia's agency in using the nut and accepting the price of departure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and release, touch and distance, inheritance and departure. The recurring motif of impressions/touching gains resonance when Nadia finally leaves moonlight footprints after avoiding contact throughout. The nut as "compass more than seed" and the grandfather's "unfinished works" create layers without explicit moralizing. The ending reweights the curse as something that can be escaped through acceptance of marking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"twilight curled the sky the color of moldy lace," "roots burrowed into the cliff like guilty prayers." POV remains stable with Nadia's selective perception filtering the surreal elements. Some register elevation in places ("graceless beauty—ugly, crooked") but largely maintains consistency. The perceptual signature of someone hyper-aware of touch and impression is sustained throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and varied syntax create momentum, though some metaphors strain ("roots burrowed...like guilty prayers"). Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Minor repetition of "forgotten blueprints" concept and occasional abstract phrasing ("graceless beauty"). The final image of "footprints carved from moonlight" resonates but verges on overwriting. Clear propulsion through the rescue sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mechanical birds as blueprint-droppers and the cursed orchard that turns people to stone offer fresh angles on familiar fantasy elements. The specific constraint of "leaving impressions without touching" creates an original magical logic. The transformation of the reluctant caretaker trope through the specific cost of permanent marking shows genuine freshness, though some elements (cursed grove, family curse) remain somewhat familiar.</comment>
