I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification**: This operates as an **Accumulative/Textural** piece, building density through mystical imagery and symbolic weight toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elias becomes the bridge between the living and the lost dead.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's characterization succeeds through his "inadvertently stubborn" refusal to let even memories go unburied, driving him to literally walk into the sea. His motivation coheres well - thirty years of undertaking creates believable obsession with proper rest. The transition from undertaker to lighthouse keeper feels earned through accumulated symbolic weight, though internal contradiction could be more visceral in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from receiving the lens to restoring the lighthouse, with the underwater library serving as the transformative crucible. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - Elias permanently changes his role from burying bodies to guiding souls home, with visible cost (bleeding fingers, his own name inscribed). Minor orientation wobble around "occupying impossible spaces" but recovers through concrete action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater library setting pressures choice brilliantly - books float like jellyfish, coral-and-bone staircases spiral down, water parts miraculously. Setting actively constrains action (water pressing in, library collapsing) and charges the final lighthouse image. Sensory work is selective and purposeful, particularly the tactile details of cold boots filling with water.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (giving the unburied rest) signals early and deepens when Elias discovers he must include his own name. The library's collapse creates genuine pressure forcing completion. Cost is visible in bleeding fingers and self-inscription, though middle escalation could tighten further - the discovery of names feels slightly mechanical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of distress signals as "absences—gaps in the ledger of the dead." The lighthouse transformation from warning beacon to guide beautifully reweights the opening's broken lens. Final image of Elias watching the restored light resonates without stating its moral about answering silent calls for help.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent mystical-realist register with strong perceptual signature ("books floated like jellyfish"). Prose rhythm modulates well with pressure, particularly during the library collapse. Some filter verb accumulation ("He recognized," "He hesitated") dulls immediacy in middle beats, and occasional register elevation ("occupying impossible spaces") slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some paraphrase loops appear ("Their stories had been erased...but here...they waited" restates the absence concept). Template cadence emerges in "He had come to...He began to...He wrote until..." sequence. Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece well, and syntactic variety mostly supports rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of undertaker-as-psychopomp with underwater library of the unburied creates genuine originality. The broken lighthouse lens becoming a tool for recording the lost dead transforms expected tropes. Risk-taking in the magical realist mode pays off, though "occupying impossible spaces" feels slightly workshopped against the otherwise organic imagery.</comment>
