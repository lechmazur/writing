<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's journey from medicated numbness to raw confrontation with guilt is earned through concrete embodied details (accordion's patched bellows, heel-to-toe platform walking). The final act of leaving the accordion behind represents genuine renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around forgiveness that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the protagonist achieves self-forgiveness through ritual action and leaves the accordion as payment. The map's transformation from geographic guide to "chart of the chest cavity" effectively reweights the journey's meaning. Cost is visible in the abandoned instrument and "weight of one withheld confession."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The disused station constrains choices effectively—the protagonist must navigate through torn ticket window, find graffiti in the lavatory, and use the platform's physical elements for ritual. Sensory details (wet creosote, crushed mint, rusted signal bell) are selective and purposeful. The ivy's responsiveness to music adds atmospheric pressure without breaking realism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: medication withdrawal → map discovery → graffiti wisdom → accordion playing → name speaking → final renunciation. Each revelation deepens the stakes around self-forgiveness. The cost accumulates through patched bellows, torn map, and ultimately leaving the accordion behind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of rivers/currents/flow versus medication's damming effect. The graffiti's wisdom ("The platform is your sternum; forgive the beat that kept you alive") offers resonant non-literal truth. The final image of laying track by leaving effectively reweights the entire journey without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("green tongues licking rust"). POV remains stable with appropriate uncertainty about the past. Some moments of elevated diction ("raw solace distilled") fit the reflective mode. Minor register drift in places but voice coheres at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly lands ("ivy had swallowed the station whole," "each rail a rib"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting in middle sections ("daringly methodical" appears twice) and occasional abstract phrasing, but prose propels effectively toward closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of mental health recovery narrative with physical pilgrimage and musical ritual. The accordion as repository of unsung apologies and the map as chest cavity chart show genuine originality. The graffiti wisdom device and transformation of forgiveness into physical leaving demonstrate risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
