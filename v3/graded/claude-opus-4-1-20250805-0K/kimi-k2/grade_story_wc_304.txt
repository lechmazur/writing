<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mortician's internal contradiction between preserving beauty and confronting oblivion drives genuine choices, particularly in her hesitation at the threshold knowing she must surrender "every spark she had ever gathered." Her micro-choices—prying the emerald, climbing to the grotto, pressing the chip despite cost—reveal consistent character-particular motivation. The final choice to release the chip and descend transformed earns its weight through prior setup of her lifelong pattern-finding habit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the mortician transforms from collector to distributor of sparks, with visible cost in surrendering all she's gathered. The accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns layer (spirals in wind, threshold, palms, faces) toward the density shift when "every life she had touched singing in harmony." Causality tracks cleanly from corpse's chip to grotto ascent to threshold activation to descent with new purpose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto with aurora overhead and glowing stone creates atmospheric pressure for the choice, while the threshold as "wavering pane of air that reflected nothing and swallowed sound" functions as the constraining mechanism. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—breath frosting, pulsing emerald, dimming aurora—filtered through her professional lens of recognizing "geometries of grief." The grotto's emptiness after transformation and the future salon with "mirrors fogged with hairspray" ground the before/after shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from preserving one spark to risking all collected sparks, with the threshold demanding total surrender as its price. The mortician's agency drives the escalation through her choice to "infuse that spark into the threshold" despite understanding the cost. The tightening occurs when she realizes crossing means "surrendering every spark" yet turning back means "oblivion claim them anyway," forcing the decisive action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the pattern motif—from finding patterns in static to tracing whorls in palms to recognizing "geometries of grief"—culminating in the final "map of every face she had loved into stillness." The story resists simple mortality themes by reframing death work as pattern preservation and spark distribution. The ending's resonant answer transforms her from one who beautifies the dead to one who plants sparks in the living "ready for the day the sky called them upward."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through her beautician-mortician lens: seeing "geometries of grief," measuring emerald chips as "no larger than a raindrop," noticing the threshold's "spirals within spirals." Voice modulates effectively from clinical observation to memory's warmth to transcendent release. Minor filter verb clusters ("she understood," "she realized") slightly dull immediacy in middle passages but don't compromise the closure's clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some paraphrase loops appear ("Finding patterns in static was her oldest habit" followed by extended restatement). Strong information density in key passages like the faces blooming sequence. Minor scaffold in phrases like "she understood then" and "rose unbidden" but these don't touch closure. The final image of the salon efficiently compresses future and past without redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of death work with cosmic threshold creates non-obvious angle on mortality themes. The specific detail of beautician-mortician as dual role, emerald chips from corpses' eyes, and the "threshold of stillness" that drinks color elevate beyond template afterlife stories. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and abstract threshold mechanics pays off through consistent pattern imagery. The transformation from collector to distributor of sparks feels earned and inevitable.</comment>
