I'll evaluate this story systematically according to the rubric.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density builds through layered imagery and pattern shifts, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the unheard bell propagates through crystallizing acid seas.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ludo's yearning algorithm as internal driver creates consistent motivation through embodied contradiction—mechanical heart pulsing with organic longing. The final choice to strike the bell despite knowing it produces no audible sound demonstrates earned agency with visible cost (arrow tip dissolving). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around the algorithm's nature.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly—the silent bell transforms the acid sea into crystallized replicas, a Conceptual Repricing where "unheard" becomes planetary propagation. The accumulative lens holds as kaleidoscope patterns build to final sympathetic vibration. Cost is visible in the arrow's dissolution and Orrin's blistered palms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The acid sea functions as active constraint—corroding hull plates creates urgency, then transforms into crystallized bells at closure. Kaleidoscope patterns constrain Ludo's navigation choices. "Burnt lemons" and "fluorescent plankton applauding" create distinctive sensory signature that charges the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: kaleidoscope decoding intensifies to flight conducting to bell-casting urgency as the workshop's anchor dissolves. The dominant stake (hearing/creating the unheard bell) tightens when "Time...suddenly snapped taut." Cost manifests in Orrin's burns and the arrow's sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of creating something explicitly "unheard" that propagates through sympathetic resonance—communication beyond conventional perception. The final image of crystallized bells "vibrating in sympathetic silence" offers a non-literal answer about connection through shared frequency rather than audible sound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines mechanical precision ("cogs chewing," "gears quickened") with organic yearning ("hollow space inside her ribs"). Perceptual signature remains consistent—Ludo processes through algorithmic translation while Orrin speaks in craftsman's aphorisms. Minor convergence in the final paragraph's elevated register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and information density throughout, with lines doing multiple jobs ("Steam rose, twisting into the shape of a question mark"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("brassy island," "sour foam," "acid sea's sour foam" in opening). Template cadence appears briefly ("She traced...She spiraled...She banked") but serves accumulative effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of mechanical creation with organic yearning offers fresh angle—a cart glider whose "heart was a yearning algorithm." The concept of bells that propagate through silence rather than sound transforms expected resolution. Risk-taking in the non-audible climax heightens conceptual stakes.</comment>
