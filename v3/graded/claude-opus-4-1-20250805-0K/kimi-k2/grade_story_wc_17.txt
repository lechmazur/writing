I'll evaluate this story through the lens of Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds meaning through sensory accumulation, recurring imagery, and pattern density rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as "corridor echo cartographer" drives consistent choices through embodied perception ("sensitively perceptive ears," "palm to the ivy-veiled passage"). Her internal conflict between uncovering and protecting truth manifests through concrete actions. The final choice to document and share rather than hide shows earned change with visible cost ("duty of remembering for them").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative structure coheres through layered discoveries building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara accepts memory-keeping duty. Cost appears in "walls dream of what they once held; legacy's burden is to keep the dream alive, not to bury it." Who/where/when anchored early ("ivy-veiled passage behind the abandoned observatory"). Pattern of echo-mapping and diary fragments creates textural density leading to crystallized stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint through "ivy-veiled passage," "bricks of star charts," "circular chamber whose bricks were glazed with fossilized starlight." The corridor's architecture shapes Mara's journey and discoveries. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("mortar pulse like a slow heartbeat," "chord so low it rattled her ribs"), with environment directly enabling the final revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: each diary fragment and echo deepens understanding of "legacy's burden." The film negative strip's transformation from keepsake to key shows meaningful tightening. Cost appears in grandfather's protective silence and Mara's acceptance of memory-keeping duty, though the emotional price could be more visceral in the moment of choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: walls dreaming, echoes remembering light, fossilized starlight. The recurring "legacy's burden" reweights from silence/protection to active remembrance. Final image of Mara mapping "the next forgotten place before the climate shifts erased it" offers resonant answer without stating moral. Climate shifts provide subtle contemporary relevance without allegory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through sound-mapping POV ("every footfall into a map of sound"). Voice maintains consistency through specialized lexicon ("corridor echo cartographer," "cartographer's code"). Some elevated diction in peak moments ("fossilized starlight," "photons") fits the elegiac tone. Psychic distance modulates effectively during vision sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("mortar pulse like a slow heartbeat") but suffers from repetitive constructions. "Half-burned diaries found in the fireplace" appears verbatim four times, creating template cadence. Some overwriting in figurative density ("walls remembering nights when telescopes drank photons"). Information density is high but momentum occasionally stalls in descriptive passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archive/memory themes through specific "corridor echo cartographer" profession and sound-mapping methodology. Climate shifts as constellation erasers offers non-obvious angle. The concept of walls dreaming and echoes remembering light transforms familiar ruins-exploration trope through sensory specificity, though some elements feel deliberately literary.</comment>
