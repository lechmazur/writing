<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nadia's internal conflict between salvaging truth and bearing witness manifests through concrete actions—breathing frost onto glass, knotting colored threads, pressing the locket to her chest. The final renunciation (leaving the shrine with salvaged snow) carries visible cost as the radioman "unhooks his ghost chain," though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("wreckage of her own mind") rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases building toward Nadia's salvage of "pure snow" and the radioman's release. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she extracts untainted memory from disaster, though the cost—while poetic ("wreckage now lighter by one secret")—lacks immediate visceral weight. The orientation anchors (glacier shrine, Nadia as wreck-diver) establish by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glacier shrine constrains choices through its "blue glow" and "carved walls" that record testimony, while the melted snow globe functions as both tool and embodied setting. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"salt-stiff hair," "oil-stained jersey," "coral-slick boot"—though some descriptions lean ornamental ("dragons of wax"). The micro-setting directly enables the final salvage act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres through accumulating revelations: dream cameos spelling "N-A-D-I-A," relics blooming from the globe, the radioman's ghost chain. The dominant stake (salvaging pure memory from wreckage) tightens when Nadia must choose what to preserve, though the resolution relies more on ritual completion than active choice under opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of extracting purity from disaster emerges through concrete images—the warped snow globe containing "permanent winter," strangers dreaming "white confetti falling in perfect silence." The final image of "borrowed starlight" keeping watch reweights all prior salvage attempts without stating a moral, achieving resonance through accumulated particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistency through patterned compression ("wreck-diver ghost whisperer") and specific perceptual signatures (Nadia experiencing time as "octaves of wreckage"). Some passages drift into elevated register ("liminal script," "seine net of memory") that strains against the established maritime vocabulary, though the effect reads intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("glass warped until the tiny village inside resembles a drowned hull"), but figurative density occasionally overwhelms clarity—"glacier's frozen breath traces sigils" appears alongside "dragons of wax" and "borrowed starlight" without clear pattern-teaching. Template constructions appear ("She has learned to," "She has come here to") though momentum generally sustains.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diving with dream analysis offers a non-obvious angle on grief and memory, particularly the concept of the drowned appearing as "background faces" in strangers' dreams. The specific detail of "14:07 nostrils fill, 14:08 hull buckles" grounds the fantastical premise, though some elements feel assembled rather than inevitable.</comment>
