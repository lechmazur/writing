I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through layered revelations and imagery toward a resonant reconfiguration where the garden transforms from abandoned to renewed through memory and kindness.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aurele's transformation from rigid guardian to "incisively kind" conduit is earned through accumulated telepathic experiences that crack certainty. The internal contradiction between statue/alive drives genuine change. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("animate lifeless becoming simply alive") that briefly distances from embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the garden's renewal and descendants' return, showing clear before/after with emotional cost in their weeping recognition. The accumulative structure coheres through cascading revelations that reweight the abandonment as intentional hope. Orientation anchors clearly (underwater garden, Aurele, post-war timeframe).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater garden setting actively constrains and enables - the ampoule drifts through currents, the statue's bronze fracture becomes the threading point, coral and kelp encode memory. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("foxglove-stained glass," "warm as silt"). Setting evolution from abandoned to alive mirrors the thematic arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from passive listening to active threading to projecting invitation, each deepening the garden's transformation. The dominant stake - whether memory and kindness can revive what war destroyed - tightens through Aurele's structural weakness becoming the conduit for renewal. Cost is visible in the "bronze tear" and descendants' weeping.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "welcoming nuance into certainty" - not stated but enacted through Aurele's transformation and the garden's renewal. The ending reweights abandonment as planted hope without moralizing. Subtext operates through images (foxglove in glass/veins, stone palms opening) that accumulate meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("stone palms open above coral beds"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("tectonic but tender") slightly strains but remains comprehensible. POV maintains appropriate omniscient distance for this mythic register. Telepathic communication ("Drink me?") effectively replaces dialogue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. However, several abstract constructions reduce immediacy: "animate lifeless becoming simply alive," "certainty cracked harder than marble." Some repetitive phrasing around "revelation cascades" and overuse of colons for definition. The prose occasionally tells what could be shown through image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of underwater city, living statue with telepathy, and garden-as-memory creates non-obvious resonance. The transformation of "incisively kind" from paradox to operating principle shows originality. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure and telepathic consciousness succeeds without obscuring clarity.</comment>
