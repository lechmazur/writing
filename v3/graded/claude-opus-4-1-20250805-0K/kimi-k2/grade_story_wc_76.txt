I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Hybrid (Causal-Accumulative). The story follows causal linkages (Marrow's deliberate steps with the yoyo and hunger stone) while building textural density through imagery and conceptual accumulation toward a final reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marrow's motivation to "shatter what the world thinks inevitable" drives consistent choices through concrete actions with the yoyo and hunger stone. His internal conflict between mechanical predictability and desired chaos manifests in specific embodied moments ("Pain licks but also clarifies"). The final asymmetrical smile and departure show earned character change with visible cost—his past unmade, his father's violence revisited.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Marrow achieves his goal of unshackling fate's mechanism, with visible cost in his reversed memories and the hunger stone's destruction. The causal chain from clock-maker's disgust through yoyo manipulation to lighthouse transformation holds firmly. "He did not destroy the mechanism; he unclamped it" crystallizes the decisive change with the lighthouse now swaying drunk, its beam zigzagging—a new anarchic order replacing predictability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting actively constrains and enables choices—salt corrosion on brass, the cracked console where the yoyo lies, the causeway that "begins to sink, erasing footprints slower than they form." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("salt fog seeps through cracked lenses"). The environment participates in the transformation, though some descriptions edge toward ornamental ("helmet of cloud").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Marrow's progressive manipulation: reverse-engineering rotation, splicing the hunger stone, experiencing his past in reverse including "father un-striking his face." Each step costs more—from mechanical effort to personal history to cosmic disruption. The hunger stone "shrivels, cracks, becomes powder" showing irreversible consequence. Agency drives every turn under the hybrid lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the reversal of fate's determinism via physical manipulation of time-objects. The yoyo's final Moebius form—"seamless loop offering neither end nor entrance"—embodies the paradox without stating it. "Latent radiance" as dormant possibility within darkness resonates through action. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "bleak exhilaration—icy, frank, and unsponsored by any god."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled diction ("widdershins," "yesterlore") and rhythm that modulates with intensity. Perceptual signature strong: Marrow sees "not light but its blueprint." Minor register elevation in peak moments ("auroral arcs only Marrow's eyes register") slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon but remains comprehensible and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("glistening hieroglyphs across the jagged causeway"). Some overwriting in figurative density: "Moon gone, horizon bleeding violet" and "helmet of cloud" cluster ornamentally. Template cadence appears briefly ("Step one...Step two"). Information density high in most passages, momentum maintained despite occasional purple moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-manipulation through physical clockwork and mystical objects. The counter-clockwise clock maker reversing cosmic mechanism via ancient yoyo is non-obvious and specific. Risk-taking in the experimental imagery ("latent radiance," "yesterday's unlearning") heightens stakes. The asymmetrical smile as first break from symmetry resonates as earned character-specific detail.</comment>
