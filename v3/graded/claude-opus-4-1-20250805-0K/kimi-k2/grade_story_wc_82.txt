<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's grief-driven motivation is embodied through concrete objects (satchel of letters, wooden bird) and her methodical transformation of pain into paper cranes, with the final choice to create hope-filled lanterns showing genuine character evolution. The internal contradiction between preserving memory and releasing grief operates throughout, though some moments edge toward therapy-speak ("to transform grief was not to erase it").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Liora's grief transforms into future-oriented hope through the crane ritual, with visible cost in her year of mourning. The basilica's reality-bending properties and the dream-recording process create coherent pressure that builds to the final image of the hospital ward sketch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating basilica's inverting gravity ("descends while ascending") constrains Liora's ritual and charges the transformation, while specific details like "silver-leafed tea shrubs" and "columns of living glass" create a vivid fantastical world. The setting actively participates in the emotional journey through its physical properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming unbearable grief—escalates through the ritual's stages: gem polishing releases regrets, paper folding captures days survived, and the cranes' flight redistributes memory into constellation. The cost is legible in "a year" of mourning and the weight that "lessened" only through active transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of grief transformation emerges through concrete imagery rather than statement, with the paper cranes serving as both literal and metaphoric vehicles for converting loss into creative purpose. The final sketch showing "hope instead of mourning" offers a non-literal answer to handling loss, though one line edges toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("Each facet she ground away was a regret, each swirl of diamond dust a sigh released") and a distinct perceptual signature focused on light and craft. Some moments of elevated diction ("luminous torment") fit the fantastical setting though occasionally strain naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong information density with most lines serving multiple purposes, particularly in the ritual sequences where action, emotion, and transformation interweave. Minor issues include occasional abstract phrasing ("folded letters, a child's wooden bird" could be more specific) and one instance of therapy-speak that dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief ritual, fantastical architecture, and paper-folding creates a fresh angle on loss, with the basilica's gravity inversion literalizing emotional transformation. The specific detail of "coughing petals of blue fire" and the plague ships create originality through particularity rather than surface novelty.</comment>
