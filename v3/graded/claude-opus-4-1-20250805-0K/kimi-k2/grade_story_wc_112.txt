I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant with Causal elements). The story builds through layered imagery and recursive time concepts, with the moth-whales' dream-songs and magnetic nexus creating textural density that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira carries her brother's presence "sideways."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to prove lateral time theory driven by grief over her lost brother creates genuine emotional stakes. The contradiction between her "obliging" public persona and private urgency adds depth. Minor deduction for the brother relationship developing late rather than anchoring early, though the final choice to accept sideways connection rather than linear recovery shows earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Lira accepts carrying her brother "sideways" rather than recovering him linearly, with felt emotional cost in "victory tasted like thawed frost." The hybrid lens holds as accumulative imagery (moth-whale songs, magnetic fields) builds toward causal action (lever pull, corridor entry). Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, and the sideways time concept pays off the taught pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The xenobiology station's "mechanically warm air" and "frost-latticed deck" create vivid sensory grounding, while the moth-whales in zero-g tanks provide unique worldbuilding. The magnetic nexus functions as micro-setting that constrains choice when it "spelled her brother's name in magnetic script." Violet clouds of Kepler-9c and the submerged pier memory layer setting effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from private experiment to physical danger as "the holographic tunnel began to collapse" forces Lira to sprint back. The dominant stake—proving lateral time to reconnect with her brother—tightens when she must choose between staying in the sideways corridor or returning to linear time. Cost manifests in accepting incomplete connection rather than full recovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the sideways time concept challenging linear grief narratives. The moth-whales' "dream-songs threaded with her sideways grief" creates resonant imagery without stating meaning. The final acceptance that her brother exists "neither to past nor future, but to the sideways moment" offers a non-literal answer to loss that avoids sentimentality through scientific framing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines scientific precision ("magnetic nexus," "fractal equations") with lyrical perception ("wings at rest left a silent echo"). POV remains tightly controlled through Lira's consciousness, with perceptual signature shown in how she experiences the moth-whales' presence. The rhythm accelerates effectively during the escape sequence, though some filter phrases ("she thought") could be cut.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "mechanically warm air that smelled faintly of ozone and thawed frost." Some repetitive phrasing around "wings at rest" and "subdued awakening" creates intentional pattern but borders on excessive. The escape sequence maintains propulsion, though "She stood alone, breathing mechanically warm air" near the end feels like unnecessary scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The sideways time concept offers fresh angle on grief narratives, avoiding linear recovery arcs. Moth-whales as dream-singers in zero-g tanks creates memorable worldbuilding. The magnetic nexus recording her brother's name in its reconfigured poles provides specific, non-obvious detail. Risk-taking in the non-linear time perception pays off, though the execution occasionally relies on familiar sci-fi furniture.</comment>
