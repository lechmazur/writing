I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric's stringent standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This operates primarily as an **Accumulative/Textural** piece with Hybrid elements. The story builds through layered imagery of time distortion, parallel realities, and resonant callbacks rather than strict causal progression. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where Cass accepts her role as "guardian of the threshold."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cass's motivation crystallizes effectively ("to merge parallel timelines") with embodied action through the radio work and hourglass manipulation. The "resiliently positive" trait manifests in concrete choices under surreal pressure. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around time-folding that could be more viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Cass embraces her role as timeline guardian, with visible cost in her permanent liminality ("guardian of the threshold, ferryman to the almost-lost"). The accumulative lens holds throughout with pattern-taught time distortions. The orientation anchors establish clearly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The spectral grotto functions as active setting that constrains choice—stalactites of frozen moonlight, pools reflecting futures, corridors of possibility. The hourglass and radio serve as micro-settings that directly enable resolution. Vivid sensory work: "stars overhead looked sideways," "underground tide of silver mist."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation through accumulative density as timeline-merging intensifies from initial ferry slip through radio work to final acceptance of guardian role. Cost is legible in Cass's isolation ("Cass alone remembered") and permanent duty. The stakes deepen effectively though could use one more visceral pressure point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete imagery of sideways time and parallel selves without explicit moralizing. The final image of Cass "humming the chord the horn had taught her" offers resonant non-literal answer to questions of duty and multiplicity. Strong subtext in the "7:15½" ghost timetable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "stalactites of frozen moonlight dripping into pools that reflected futures instead of faces." POV remains stable with Cass's perceptual signature intact. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("resonating with the static until patterns emerged") that slightly exceeds the deckhand's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Deductions for scattered template constructions ("Cass felt," "She understood," "Passengers saw") and some paraphrase-adjacent lines around timeline concepts. The "three short, three long, three short" SOS pattern adds specificity. Information density is high but occasionally tips into mild overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ferry crossing with timeline-merging creates genuine originality. The sideways hourglass and spectral grotto avoid cliché through specific detail. Risk-taking in the surreal elements heightens stakes effectively (+0.3 within band). The concept of "7:15½" ghost timetable is particularly inventive.</comment>
