Looking at this story through the lens of immediate publishability in a competitive literary market:

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through ritual repetition, sensory accumulation, and pattern density toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila's characterization succeeds through embodied ritual and specific gestural details (bell kissed like a relic, flour-dusted finger blessing). Her motivation as community keeper coheres through concrete actions. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "tomorrow is already planted" which edges toward label-speak at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the seed packets transforming survival into future-planting, with visible cost in the sanctions context. The accumulative structure builds effectively through ritual repetition. However, the unfinished final sentence creates ambiguity about whether full closure lands on-page, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting functions as active constraint throughout - the ridge paths, broken arbor, and terra-cotta tiles all shape movement and choice. Sensory work is selective and purposeful (wet clay, woodsmoke, moon snagging on trellis). The arbor particularly charges the final gathering scene as both shelter and symbol.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual survival to collective identity ("declare that we are still a people") with the seeds representing future possibility. The sanctions create persistent pressure throughout. Cost is visible in the exile condition and resource scarcity, though the anonymous donations slightly soften the immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars - the bell's journey, saffron's wedding memory, seeds as future faith. The piece resists easy moralizing while building toward collective resilience. The "tomorrow is already planted" lands with earned resonance despite edging toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elegiac register with controlled rhythm that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature strong in selective details (bell "no larger than a walnut," moon "low enough to snag"). Dialogue carries authentic subtext and advances character relationships naturally.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful compression. Information density high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from POV register ("terra-cotta arbor," "amplified quiet"). The unfinished final sentence, while potentially intentional, creates structural uncertainty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The exile community's midnight food runs offer a fresh angle on survival narratives, avoiding both misery porn and false uplift. The antique bell as continuity object and the saffron-memory moment show specific invention. The anonymous donation system provides original texture though doesn't fully transform the broader exile trope.</comment>
