<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lin's pacifism anchors her choices throughout, from gathering photographs to offering the tear without violence, with internal consistency maintained. The final choice to sacrifice Kwan Yin's Tear demonstrates earned renunciation with visible cost—the loss of the relic that defines her. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "shadow work" and "relentless presence" that edges toward diagnostic language rather than embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Lin's act transforms the ship from tomb to garden, with the cost being the dissolution of the sacred tear itself. The progression from floating through corridors to stitching photographs to opening the dimensional door follows accumulative logic, each image adding weight until the final transformation. Orientation anchors (Lin, ship, post-humanity context) establish clearly within opening paragraphs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The recycled ship functions as more than backdrop—its failing gravity generators respond to Lin's emotional state, physically lifting her as she works. Specific details like "hydroponic basil gone wild" and "chapel of reclaimed aluminum" create lived-in texture. The environment directly enables the story's resolution when seeds drift through to plant in "recycled soil," making setting inseparable from closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Lin's deepening engagement with grief: from passive floating to active stitching to sacrificial offering. The dominant stake—confronting collective trauma to unlock possibility—tightens as each photograph adds weight to her tapestry. Cost becomes tangible when Lin must surrender the tear itself, her most sacred possession, to complete the transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the necessity of confronting buried grief to unlock new dimensions of existence. The final image of weapons becoming garden substrate offers resonant answer without stating a moral. The recurring motif of tears (Kwan Yin's, dried on photos, Lin's own) accumulates meaning that charges the dissolution at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice blends technical spacefaring vocabulary with spiritual imagery ("creaked like an old violin," "lighthouse remembering the sea"). POV remains consistently close third with controlled psychic distance. Some register elevation in phrases like "relentless presence" and "shadow work" slightly disrupts the otherwise grounded voice, though the lyric mode largely justifies the heightened diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Information density high—most sentences advance both external action and internal state. Deductions for occasional abstraction ("everything denied," "long reckoning") and one instance of telling what's shown ("Lin understood"). The filter verb "felt" appears multiple times but serves the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of space opera aftermath with Buddhist compassion mythology creates non-obvious angle. The concept of gravity responding to emotional state and photographs becoming dimensional keys shows genuine invention. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and incomplete ending (story cuts mid-word) demonstrates confidence, though the spiritual journey framework itself is familiar.</comment>
