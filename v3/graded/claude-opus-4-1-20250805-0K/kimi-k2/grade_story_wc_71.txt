<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to understand why houses feel alive drives consistent, embodied choices through sanctifying displaced objects. Internal experience differs from external calm through concrete details like "the shard warmed against her palm." The final recognition that "life is not the opposite of absence but its echo" emerges from accumulated specific actions, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("inadvertently profound").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught ritual of sanctifying objects that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where houses learn "how to breathe without breaking." Cost is legible through the widow's "grief from turning into haunting" and the noticer's transformation from observer to listener. The orris root shard left behind and empty pockets signal genuine sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices through specific displaced objects (marble under stove, mitten on mantel) that must be sanctified. The bay's architecture of absence—"doors ajar and never returned"—creates the pressure system. Environment charges the final image through "houses exhaled in unison, a hushed blaze warming the spring night."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each sanctified object deepens the hush until "the bay itself grew still, tide pausing mid-breath." The protagonist's agency drives every beat through deliberate ritual choices. Cost accumulates through surrendered objects and the final transformation where she becomes "no longer a noticer but a listener."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: displaced objects become vessels for memory and absence. The ending reweights all prior sanctifications when houses reveal "life is not the opposite of absence but its echo." No explicit moralizing; the widow's silent recognition and the compass needle "pointing true again" embody thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic details ("scent of violet and dust threading salt air") and selective attention to displacement. Controlled modulation from dreamlike opening to crystalline precision during sanctification. Minor elevation into "inadvertently profound" doesn't match established register but recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "brass key lay beneath a flowerpot, displaced from any lock." Some elevated diction ("creeping normality noticer," "inadvertently profound") creates mild register friction. Strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "shard of hush" that accumulates meaning rather than loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magical realism with domestic grief through specific invention of sanctifying displaced objects. The concept of houses remembering "futures as well as pasts" through the narrator's own future note transforms familiar haunted house tropes. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens resonance.</comment>
