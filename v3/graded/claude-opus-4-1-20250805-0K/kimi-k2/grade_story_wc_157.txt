I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through sensory patterns, metaphorical density, and a final crystallization where gardens exhale unified defiance.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysander's motivation as a smuggler of banned alphabets is immediately clear and consistent. His internal world shows concrete embodiment ("seed beneath his tongue," "smiled the disarming smile") and contradictory impulses (preserving language while accepting potential self-destruction). The final incomplete line "grafting onto every" suggests cost through unfinished transformation, though the truncation weakens full payoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through gardens speaking "in unison, a fragrance of defiance" that transforms individual resistance into collective voice. Cost is visible in accepting "the spark might burn the hand that fed it oxygen." However, the abrupt ending mid-sentence ("grafting onto every") undermines full closure delivery, though the pattern of unified botanical rebellion lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively constrains and enables—insects carry untraceable messages, pitcher plants digest auditor-mimics, and gardens become living typography. Sensory detail is exceptional ("humid air shimmered, converging chaos of heat and scent"). The botanical cipher system where plants rearrange into punctuation and words makes setting indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual message-passing to city-wide botanical rebellion, with auditor-mimics creating immediate physical threat. The warp mechanism provides clear tightening as the cipher shifts mid-operation. Cost manifests through Lysander accepting potential self-immolation ("spark might burn the hand"), though the truncated ending prevents full cost articulation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of living language that cannot be taxed or controlled. The final image of gardens exhaling unified defiance offers a non-literal answer about resistance through organic systems. Subtext operates beautifully through botanical imagery—seeds as codes, roots as punctuation, plants speaking "in chlorophyll and light."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through botanical-linguistic fusion ("contraband sonnets," "digestive acids smelled faintly of redacted footnotes"). Perceptual signature is strong—Lysander notices through a smuggler's lens of concealment and revelation. Dialogue is minimal but effective ("Looking for pollen, little inspector?"). The prose rhythm accelerates with the warp sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("rows of orchid mantis nymphs practiced their prayers"). However, several overwrought metaphors strain clarity ("digestive acids smelled faintly of redacted footnotes," "faulty syntax" for city lights). The abrupt truncation mid-sentence is a significant technical flaw. Some figurative density in peak beats borders on excess.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept of botanical resistance to thought taxation is genuinely original. The synthesis of entomology, cryptography, and guerrilla gardening creates something memorably specific. Risk-taking through the incomplete ending and dense metaphorical system heightens the sense of ongoing transformation, though the truncation costs some points.</comment>
