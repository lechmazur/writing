<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—preserve memory vs. survive—act simultaneously through the crystal vial's physical presence against her glove while oxygen depletes. The choice to release her mother's memory for survival lands with visible cost: "Mara felt the moment...begin to fade from her mind." Internal conflict embodied through concrete action of letting perfume fall, not just declared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) lands with clear cost: Mara trades her most precious memory to survive, choosing "the second she let the perfume fall" as her one preservable moment. Causal lens holds: because the temple requires surrendering what one most wants to keep, therefore Mara must release her mother's memory to unlock the mechanism. The "gathered hush" functions as persistent constraint shaping tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The temple's "gathered hush" and coral-snarled mechanism constrain Mara's choice directly—she must physically press helmet to altar, drop perfume on sensor. Underwater setting creates time pressure through depleting oxygen (43 minutes, then 31, then 20). The crystal vial transforms from memory-trigger to sacrificial key, charging the final image when "empty yet somehow heavier."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency: Mara chooses to sacrifice her most precious memory despite wanting to preserve it. Cost unmistakable: "her mother's last smile—begin to fade from her mind" in exchange for "the ability to hold any future instant, once, perfectly." The tightening oxygen counter (43→31→20 minutes) forces decision without allowing retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: "surrender could be a form of power" earned through the specific act of releasing perfume, not stated as philosophy. The empty-yet-heavier vial in final image reweights the entire premise—what we release gains different weight than what we grasp. No explicit moralizing; the trade's complexity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mara experiences the temple's hush as "weight she could almost cup in her palms," sees "ghosts across algae-filmed constellations." Voice modulates under pressure—shorter fragments during escape ("Thirty-one minutes remained") versus lyrical expansion in quieter moments. No head-hopping; elision of ascent details serves momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "floated inside the cracked observatory dome, her exosuit's lamp painting ghosts across algae-filmed constellations" establishes location, equipment, atmosphere simultaneously. Minor repetition of "gathered hush" and "lonesome splendor" reads as purposeful pattern, not loop. Some elevated diction ("colonnades," "nave") fits underwater temple context.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: underwater temple that preserves moments through sacrifice, not storage. The specific twist—temple stores "the instinct to keep them"—transforms expected preservation narrative. Risk-taking in choosing internal renunciation over physical action for climax heightens emotional stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
