I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference**: This is an Accumulative/Textural piece. The story builds through layered temporal paradoxes, meditation imagery, and the central metaphor of pond rings spreading outward/inward. The closure arrives through pattern accumulation rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara-Lira's backwards aging creates genuine contradiction between teaching and withholding, embodied through physical regression ("joints loosening into flexibility of youth"). The final choice to release the stone despite knowing its consequences shows earned agency with visible cost—she accepts dissolution into childhood.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Charged Poise: "I am already gone, and that is how I remain" crystallizes the paradox with felt cost. The backwards temporal structure coheres under accumulative logic, though the truncated ending ("each footfall er") undermines full closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The floating meditation platform and magnetic grotto create atmospheric pressure that shapes the trance state. Sensory details like "metallic pulse that matched the slowing of her heartbeat" integrate setting with internal state. The pond's rings constrain the teaching method throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes build through temporal accumulation—each ring representing years of deliberate forgetting, with the "outermost, thin and bright" marking complete disappearance. The withheld revelation creates sustained tension, though pressure relies more on conceptual weight than active conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The vanishing/appearing paradox emerges organically through the pond rings metaphor without explicit statement. "To teach vanishing to appear, she had to let the student believe she was learning to stay" captures thematic complexity. The final image of walking "backward into the future" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm: "rings from a stone she had not yet thrown were already spreading." The backwards temporal perspective is maintained consistently. However, the abrupt truncation ("each footfall er") damages voice integrity at the crucial final moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong figurative control in places ("ghost ripples arriving before the cause"), but repetitive phrasing appears: multiple "Elara-Lira [verb]" constructions, "sycamore hush" used twice identically. The incomplete final sentence is a critical technical failure that prevents clean closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The backwards-aging meditation teacher concept offers fresh perspective on memory and identity. The specific synthesis of temporal reversal with teaching paradox ("withhold the final answer from herself until the lesson could be endured") feels original, though some elements trend toward familiar meditation-story territory.</comment>
