<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Characters show genuine internal contradiction through concrete action (Azim's radical gentleness, Leylah's exhausted softness instead of expected revenge). The final act of rebuilding through shared grief demonstrates earned transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional beats ("mercy twisted askew").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds toward the plaza's transformation through tessera placement. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the plaza "exhales" and transforms from graveyard to "breathing confession" with clear cost (weeks of labor after loss). Orientation anchors solidly by line 3. Deduction for slight ambiguity in how the retrocognitive element functions causally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains and enables choices - the broken tessera become the material for rebuilding, the plaza's geography guides their ritual walk. Vivid sensory work ("stars dripped through the seams, pooling in cracks"). The minaret's transformation from monument to scattered pieces to reconstructed meaning charges the final image powerfully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from personal grief to collective healing through the act of reconstruction. The tessera placement escalates from individual gesture to shared ritual with the plaza's final "exhalation." Cost is visible in their "fire-forgiven hands" working through night. Minor deduction for relatively gentle pressure that could push harder.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the central image of rebuilding with broken pieces - "Empathy burns more than rage, but rage leaves less to rebuild." The final transformation of "graveyard of ideals into breathing confession" offers resonant answer without moralizing. The red tessera as both wound and vision exemplifies thematic complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains lyric compression with purposeful elision ("the hundred fractured" cuts off meaningfully). POV filters everything through architectural/artistic perception fitting the reconstruction work. Dialogue sparse but weighted with subtext. Excellent control of psychic distance during the retrocognitive moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly lands ("stars dripped through seams," "history folded like wet parchment"). Some overwriting in places ("mercy twisted askew—the aberrant mercy") creates density issues. Template cadence appears briefly ("Where the leaf ended, we placed jade chips; where sky fractured, we laid cerulean"). Information density generally high with purposeful compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-conflict healing through literal mosaic reconstruction transforms familiar war aftermath territory. The specific detail of tessera as both wound and healing tool, the "fire-cartographer who mapped loss," and the plaza's animate response create memorable originality. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and elliptical ending heightens stakes.</comment>
