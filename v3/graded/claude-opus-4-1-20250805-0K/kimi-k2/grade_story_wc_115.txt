I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases through layered metaphysical imagery (beaded valve wheel, weight measurements, ghost shift) that culminates in a resonant reconfiguration about the nature of swallowed truths.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between skepticism and belief ("religiously skeptical") plays out through concrete micro-choices—touching the wheel despite knowing "artifacts woke stories," carrying the Saint Jude medal. The final renunciation of certainty about the medal's purpose ("no longer sure if it was luck or merely ballast") shows earned character movement with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: Mara's understanding that "the weight of a swallowed truth is not fixed; it shifts, ghostlike" transforms her relationship to both Jonah's confession and her own skepticism. The cost manifests in her release of epistemological certainty. The accumulative lens holds as density builds through layered measurements (137 grams, 21 grams) toward this conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel functions as both setting and constraint, its "brass spokes threaded with tiny glass beads the color of dried blood" creating tactile specificity that charges the final understanding. The tunnel's "coal-blackened gravel" and "cold air that smelled of machine oil and old prayers" ground the metaphysical in sensory reality, with the environment actively shaping Mara's choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from Jonah's confession to the wheel's discovery, through the layered psychic voices to the revelation of weights (137 grams/tongue, 21 grams/soul). The cost becomes legible when Mara physically holds "her brother's swallowed truth, dense as lead, hot as grief" before releasing it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of measuring guilt's weight, never stated but embodied in the beaded wheel's function as "a ledger, a place where unspoken things were weighed." The final image of the Saint Jude medal as either "luck or merely ballast" offers a non-literal answer about faith versus materiality that reweights the entire narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent texture through inventive compression ("drowsy alertness," "factory ghost shift") and character-specific perception ("every explorer knew touching artifacts woke the stories"). The prose modulates effectively with pressure, tightening during the wheel's activation: "three beats, pause, two beats." Minor convergence in emotional peaks prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Legend claimed the alcove once housed a valve station for a textile mill that ran phantom looms after hours, producing nothing but the smell of wet cotton and regret." Some filter-verb clustering ("Mara felt," "she understood") in high-pressure moments reduces immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of urban exploration, industrial haunting, and psychic radio creates genuine freshness. The specific detail of measuring guilt in grams (137 for a tongue, 21 for a soul) transforms familiar ghost-story elements through precise, unexpected quantification.</comment>
