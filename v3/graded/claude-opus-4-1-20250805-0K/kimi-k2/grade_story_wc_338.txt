I'll evaluate this story through the lens of **Accumulative/Textural** design, as the piece builds meaning through layered images, recurring motifs (maps, tears, shadows, silence), and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's methodical curiosity manifests through concrete actions—tracing ruptures, aligning frames, pressing maps to walls—with her motivation crystallizing from professional precision to empathic interpretation. The final choice to create a map "stitched with silver thread" demonstrates earned transformation with visible cost (accepting wounds as windows).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's final map transforms tears from damage into deliberate seams, with cost legible in "every blank on parchment was a wound." The accumulative lens holds as shadows grow fingers, maps tear identically, and absence gains presence through layered revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The chapel's rain-scoured frescoes and growing shadows constrain Elara's investigation methods while the tear in the map becomes the literal interface for discovery. Environment actively participates—the wall "exhaled and drew it in"—making setting indispensable to the closure's charged image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation: matching tears lead to film comparison, shadow evolution reveals deliberate erasure, the wall responds by drawing the missing henge. The cost crystallizes in accepting that "every blank on parchment was a wound," though the middle section could tighten slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of absence/presence, silence/speech, wound/window without explicit moralizing. The final image of maps "stitched with silver thread that caught the light like rain on stone" resonantly answers the central question about interpreting erasure with empathy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through Elara's cartographic lens—she reads tears "millimeter for millimeter," traces "raised grain where fibers had parted." Voice maintains lyric precision under pressure, though occasional elevated diction ("scoured until saints and sinners alike blurred") slightly exceeds the POV's professional register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with evocative imagery ("Rain hissed against the vaulted ceiling"), but some density issues appear: "shapeless, unmoving" shadow description and mild redundancy in "deliberately omitted" following "erased." The filter verb "seemed to whisper" and abstract phrasing like "shielded openness" occasionally dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartography, archaeology, and film analysis creates an original investigative method. The concept of maps tearing at identical invisible boundaries and walls drawing missing henges in reverse offers genuine ingenuity, though the "whispered chapel" feels slightly derivative of gothic conventions.</comment>
