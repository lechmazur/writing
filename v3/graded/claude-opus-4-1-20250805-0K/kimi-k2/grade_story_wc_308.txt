<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "navigate without moving" drives a coherent internal journey through embodied contradictions—pressing the arrowhead to chest, feeling ancestral pulses, ultimately choosing transformation. The final choice to become a tower carries visible cost (losing mobility, individual identity) earned through prior accumulation of dust/memory imagery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the skimmer becomes a tower of bone, transforming from seeker to map itself. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices movement and individual existence to complete the navigation paradox, with the arrowhead embedding permanently in her chest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The canyon setting with towers of bone constrains the central choice—crossing is impossible, forcing the navigation paradox. Environmental details (dust accumulation, echo patterns, bird formations) directly shape the protagonist's realization and final transformation, with the towers teaching "weathered resolve" through their physical presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: dust settling deeper, pulse quickening, towers beginning to sing, culminating in the protagonist's transformation. The cost—becoming immobile stone—is legible throughout via the towers' example, though the piece relies more on textural deepening than causal tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the navigation paradox without explicit moralizing—stillness as accumulation, memory as map, transformation as arrival. The final image of future skimmers learning from her tower offers a resonant answer to how one travels without moving, reweighting all prior dust/memory/patience imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled repetition of key phrases ("pulse left wandering," "centuries of layered dust") that accumulates meaning. Some register elevation in places ("historically reverent grief") but the patterned repetition serves the accumulative design and the POV remains consistent through transformation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Purposeful repetition creates rhythm but occasionally tips into mechanical loops ("centuries of layered dust" appears 5 times, "pulse left wandering" 6 times). Strong moments like "towers of bone rose like frozen screams" and the birds writing "equations of wind" show vivid precision, though some passages lean on abstract phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of navigation/stillness paradox with the specific image of becoming the map itself rather than reading it. The transformation from stone skimmer (active) to tower of bone (static teacher) offers a non-obvious resolution that feels inevitable given the established pattern of accumulated patience.</comment>
