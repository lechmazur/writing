I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern intensification rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation as storm herald is grounded in concrete actions (trimming wick, steering mirrors) with embodied emotion ("sweat and rain indistinguishable"). His transformation from sailor to herald carries genuine cost shown through "the storm inside his ribs" and his final dissolution into the storm itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Kael's transformation into "the laughing storm itself," with visible cost in the lighthouse crumbling to "green dust." The accumulative lens holds as density increases from routine to prophecy to transformation, though the prophetic fracture's mechanics could be clearer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse constrains and enables key choices - the fractured wick shows tomorrow's path, the mirror array multiplies futures, and the reef's "ancient shadows" become the ink for rewriting morning. Setting actively participates in the transformation rather than merely hosting it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural intensification: from routine trimming to prophetic fracture to steering storms to final transformation. The cost is legible as Kael releases physical form ("the lighthouse crumbled behind him"), though middle beats could tighten the pressure more explicitly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of reshaping dawn from shadows, avoiding abstract statements. The final image of the floating shard "still whispering futures" resonantly reweights the opening's "stars that had forgotten morning" without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled mythic register ("blade of jade," "liquid malachite") and strong perceptual signature in how Kael experiences the storm as "old friends who owed favors." Syntax modulates effectively with rising intensity, maintaining coherence through the transformation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dense, imagistic prose with strong momentum, though occasional overwriting appears ("fossilized leviathans, drowned constellations"). Some metaphor density in peak beats borders on excessive ("the black sun waited, not a sphere but an open pupil") but clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse keeper as storm herald steering reality through fractured prophecy feels fresh and earned. The specific detail of "thunderclap puns" and "waterspout that bowed like a jester" transforms familiar storm imagery through unexpected personification. Risk-taking in the surreal transformation sequence heightens stakes effectively.</comment>
