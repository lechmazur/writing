I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as the piece builds through layered imagery and rhythmic repetition toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mira revives the dying rosebush through her grandfather's brass tooth and humming cadence.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to "reflect light into dark corners" manifests through concrete action as she hums with "the rhythm of oars in water" to revive the rose. Her "protected vulnerability" shows in the match-flame metaphor and her choice between shielding or smothering. The final choice to instill light "quietly, completely" demonstrates earned agency with visible cost in her creaking knees and night-long labor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Mira transforms from passive pruning to active revival, with green sap beading as proof of change. The brass tooth shifts from memorial object to functional tool, and the rose from dying to budding. Cost appears in physical exhaustion and the vulnerability of "cupping a match flame in bare hands." The accumulative structure coheres through the rowing rhythm that links grandfather's wisdom to present action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fire escape micro-setting constrains choice—Mira must work with "tin cans and cracked teacups" in limited space. The harbor's "black water catching fractured moonlight" mirrors the garden's transformation from darkness to illumination. The brass tooth's physical properties (notches, vibration) enable the central action. Setting evolves from "quivering hush" to active "listening" as even the watchman carries the tune.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from pruning a dying rose to actively reviving it through inherited knowledge. The "quivering hush" deepens twice—first when the tooth touches the stem, then when "even gulls on the pier dared not cry." Cost manifests in Mira's "protected vulnerability" and physical exhaustion, with the final image of "a small, defiant lantern" showing transformed agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the grandfather's wisdom that "Every lock has a song, child, and every garden a key," paid off when Mira uses the lockmaster's tool to unlock the rose's vitality. The final image of scattered light reaching "every corner the moon could not reach" resonates without stating a moral. The piece earns its wisdom through concrete action rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with musical cadence ("luminous harbor by moonlight") and selective perception focused on tactile details. The "rhythm of oars in water" becomes syntactic pattern in key moments. Perceptual signature shows in how Mira notices "fractured moonlight" and feels "the pulse of sap beneath bark"—a gardener's specific attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "the last petal of the century-old rosebush drifting past her cheek like a silent goodbye" establishes time, loss, and tone simultaneously. Rhythm varies from long, flowing sentences to short declarations ("A faint vibration answered"). Some minor repetition of "quivering hush" and "rhythm of oars" serves the accumulative pattern rather than creating loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmithing and gardening through the brass tooth measuring plant vitality offers a non-obvious connection. The specific detail of using a bitting gauge tooth as a gardening tool transforms both occupations. However, the magical realism of humming to revive plants follows somewhat familiar territory, though executed with particular grace.</comment>
