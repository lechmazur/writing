Looking at this story through an Accumulative/Textural lens, as its lyric mode builds through layered imagery toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The memory keeper's motivation drives concrete actions—weaving dawn-thread, singing forgotten songs, climbing to swaddle the greenhouse—with embodied struggle ("voice cracking"). Her internal conflict between holding and releasing memories creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("bound release, sorrow and joy braided") that briefly escapes embodiment in middle beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the memory keeper accepts her own scattering as seeds, with clear cost (losing her memories) that enables the orchard's survival. The accumulative structure coheres as each woven dawn builds toward the final swaddling. Slight deduction for the cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final moment, though "lighter now, seeds on new wind" carries weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of setting as active participant—the mica window flakes under touch, trees lean with encoded lullabies, soil trembles in response. The greenhouse functions as both container and patient, constraining her actions while receiving her cure. The transformation from "endless night" to "pale and trembling, but alive" sky directly results from her environmental manipulation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: night "pushes back, hungry, unraveling her song faster than she could weave it," forcing deeper sacrifice (kneeling, whispering the peach memory, climbing higher). The final stakes crystallize when she must release her own memories to save the realm. Cost is legible but could be more viscerally dramatized at the peak moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the paradox of preservation through release—memories must scatter to survive. The image system (woven dawns, swaddling, seeds) creates resonance without stating meaning. The final realization that "the orchard would remember for her" offers a non-literal answer to the story's central question about communal memory transcending individual loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"air tasted of iron and lullabies," "thread spun from woven dawns." The perceptual signature remains consistent through sensory selectivity and metaphoric density. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the POV's established range ("symmetric satisfaction" feeling), though the mythic tone largely justifies the diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong imagistic density with lines doing multiple jobs—"bark etched with runes that spelled out lullabies in languages that had never been spoken aloud" builds world, atmosphere, and stakes simultaneously. Deduction for two instances of abstract telling ("bound release" construction, "sorrow and joy braided so tightly") and one paraphrase loop around the swaddling concept that slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory-keeping with physical weaving creates an original magic system where dawn becomes thread. The specific detail of "stealing seconds of sunrise from dreams no one else remembered" transforms a familiar trope. The resolution through dispersal rather than preservation offers a non-obvious answer, though some elements (dying realm, chosen keeper) echo established patterns.</comment>
