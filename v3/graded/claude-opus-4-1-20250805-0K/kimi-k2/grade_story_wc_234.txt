I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern and density toward a resonant reconfiguration where friendship transforms understanding of time and presence.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Characters show genuine internal complexity through embodied details like "controlled wildfire" in their eyes and the physical gesture of pressing foreheads together. The transformation from bottling time to releasing it feels earned through their shared history, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("density of presence") rather than remaining fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the friends transform their understanding of time from capture to choice, with visible cost in crushing the last pocket-sun. The accumulative structure coheres well, building from arrival through revelation to transformation, though the conceptual weight occasionally outpaces dramatic pressure in middle beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ember nexus functions as active setting that constrains and enables transformation - tiles that "drink" color, the plinth of cooling lava glass, the plaza that "exhales." The columella curl serves as both object and metaphysical architecture, its spiral chambers becoming "a map of every dusk they had stolen."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes center on transforming their relationship to time and presence, with escalation through the secret's revelation and the choice to destroy rather than preserve. The crushing of the pocket-sun carries real cost, though middle sections could tighten the pressure between understanding and action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation from "pocket-suns...had been cages, not lanterns" to "presence is not captured but chosen." The final image of portable presence in the columella curl's pulse beautifully reweights all prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through inventive compounds like "pocket-sun alchemist" and "scientifically romantic," with consistent perceptual signature in how Liora experiences the world through alchemical and astronomical metaphors. Dialogue carries authentic intimacy in Cael's breathed confession.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs, like "comet's tail" simultaneously describing movement and celestial nature. Some abstract phrases like "density of presence" and "directed spontaneity" risk opacity, though the controlled rhythm and varied syntax maintain strong momentum throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy, astronomy, and friendship creates a fresh angle on time and memory. The specific invention of "pocket-suns" as bottled noonlight and the columella curl as temporal architecture show genuine imaginative reach beyond template fantasy.</comment>
