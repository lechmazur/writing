I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and metaphorical transformation rather than strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as "curious civil engineer intern" drives consistent action through engineering-as-resurrection, with embodied moments like "pressed her palm to the vibration." The transformation from repair to resurrection feels earned through accumulated details, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("equations for hope").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the terminal transforms from abandonment to "arrivals that had never stopped happening," with visible cost in the rerouted systems and Mara's night of work. The accumulative structure coheres well, building from carnival departure through engineering interventions to living garden.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exceptional integration where setting becomes active agent—"the terminal itself was a sextant of sorts." Spatial choreography from gate through corridors to rotunda is clear, with environment constraining choices (maintenance panels, dormant conduits) and enabling transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from curiosity to resurrection as Mara discovers the terminal's hidden geometry and commits to transformation. The escalation through "redirecting flows" to creating a "newborn garden" shows clear progression with cost in effort and time, though external pressure remains minimal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation metaphor—"hope is a vector that reverses loss by rerouting it into possibility." The sextant-as-navigation-tool becomes a lens for seeing potential in abandonment, avoiding explicit moralizing while building resonance through accumulated imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("boarding corridors branching and rebranching") and consistent POV. Some moments risk purple prose ("starlight pooled like spilled sugar") but generally maintain purposeful compression appropriate to the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though occasional overwriting appears ("small astonishments," "quiet engine of stoic wonder"). Some abstract phrasing ("equations for hope," "vectors...into equations") creates mild opacity but doesn't obscure the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering expertise with poetic transformation—turning infrastructure repair into resurrection. The specific detail of hydroponic vines feeding from fountain pumps and the sextant completing terminal geometry shows genuine originality beyond template responses.</comment>
