I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through sensory accumulation, metaphorical density, and pattern-based progression rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to understand weather-carriers is embodied through the taste-based sensory system, with internal conflict between skepticism and luminous perception driving concrete micro-choices. The convergence with Mara shows earned transformation through their merged climates, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("tolerable season").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the two climates merge, with visible cost in the ring dissolving into Mara's veins and the aurora surrendering to darkness. The accumulative structure coheres through sensory patterns (taste/weather/metal), though the forests' election subplot slightly dilutes focus.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lavender bluff setting actively constrains choices through its aurora/rain vote and mineral history that explains the ring's properties. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("ozone and cardamom"), with the environment directly shaping the convergence requirement and final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing Mara's internal storm from flooding the valley—escalates through the forest's vote forcing immediate convergence. Cost is visible in the ring's dissolution and weather redistribution, though agency feels slightly passive until the final convergence act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of internal weather and shared atmospheric burden without explicit moralizing. The final image of "two climates merged into one tolerable season" resonantly answers the central question about why people carry weather, earned through specific sensory and physical details.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through taste-based navigation and lyrical compression creates controlled voice. Non-standard constructions ("luminous skeptic," "emergent compass") serve the otherworldly tone consistently, with rhythm modulating effectively during the convergence sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose maintains high information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional abstraction creeps in ("tolerable season," "shared atmosphere"). Some figurative density in non-pressure moments ("silver moth orbiting my wrist") but generally serves the accumulative pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of weather-as-emotion with taste-based navigation creates a genuinely fresh angle on connection and burden-sharing. Risk-taking through the surreal forest election and metal-memory system heightens stakes while maintaining coherence, with the convergence solution feeling inevitable yet non-obvious.</comment>
