I'll evaluate this story through an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds density through compression metaphor, sensory layering, and a pattern of absence/presence that culminates in the final transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara's grief-driven compression of loss into physical form shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—the need to shape versus fear of releasing the roar. The final choice to carry "the harvest of loss" demonstrates earned transformation through tactile, embodied action with visible cost in the hollows she creates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres through the compression metaphor—from steam rising to thumbprint impressions to final crystallization. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara transforms grief into "something she could finally hold without breaking," with cost visible in the hollows that "caught the light like a tear."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight and kettle's time constraint actively pressure Mara's creation process. Setting details like "rust-hued peace" and "chains swaying...like distant cages opening" mirror internal states through action, with the loft's transformation charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The kettle's ninety-second countdown creates genuine time pressure that forces Mara's tactile engagement with grief. The escalation from inability to shape for three seasons to rapid compression work shows meaningful deepening, with cost legible in each hollow as "a lesson harvested from the nights she woke reaching."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the compression metaphor without statement: "love is not erased when the beloved leaves; it is compressed, made portable, hauntingly practical." The final whisper "Stay wild" offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire piece through acceptance of untamed loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature tracks grief through tactile sensation—"planed smooth," "condensation bloom," "warming under her touch." Rhythmic control heightens during the compression sequence, though occasional elevated diction ("rust-hued peace") slightly exceeds natural register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly "each hollow a lesson harvested from the nights she woke reaching." Minor template cadence in middle section ("She breathed...She pressed...She worked") and slight overwriting in figurative density reduce perfection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The compression-as-grief-work concept offers fresh synthesis, transforming familiar widow's mourning through specific tactile craft. The risk of working entirely through metaphor pays off in the crystallized final image where abstract loss becomes physically portable.</comment>
