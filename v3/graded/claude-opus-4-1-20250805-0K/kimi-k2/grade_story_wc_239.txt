<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The witness's journey from observer to participant shows clear internal evolution through embodied details like the dictionary growing lighter and memories flooding through her palm. The final transformation into "librarian of the beginning" is earned through accumulated sensory experiences, though some abstract passages ("spiral arbitration") lack the concrete grounding that would push this higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through density increases and pattern breaks toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the witness absorbs the library and becomes its keeper. The cost is legible in the dissolution of separation and the weight of carrying "everything and nothing." Minor orientation delays (who/where anchors arrive late) prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The library setting actively constrains choices through Möbius corridors and the lectern of "petrified dawn," with vivid sensory details like "cedar and ozone." The environment transforms with the protagonist, collapsing into "sentences that orbited her like fireflies," though some descriptions lean abstract rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation operates through textural accumulation as the dictionary empties, the spiral tightens, and the witness fragments into "narrative possibilities." The cost manifests in surrendering individual identity to become the cosmos's self-reading consciousness, though the abstract nature of "spiral arbitration" slightly dulls the pressure's specificity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "journeying inward while walking out" and the collapse of witness/witnessed duality. The final image of strangers "feeling briefly whole" offers a resonant answer to cosmic separation without stating a moral, elevated by the dictionary's transformation from text to "pulse."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm ("wanderingly exact") and consistent lyric register that matches the cosmic scope. Strong perceptual signature in phrases like "tessellated floor that remembered every footfall," though occasional abstract elevations ("spiral arbitration") slightly exceed the POV's established texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in sensory descriptions that advance both atmosphere and meaning. Some repetitive structures ("She understood," "She felt," "She pressed") create minor template cadence, and abstract phrases like "spiral arbitration" appear without sufficient grounding, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of a witness becoming the library itself offers genuine originality, with risk-taking in the lyric/accumulative structure paying off through coherent imagery. The transformation of reading into embodiment ("swallowed the dot") and the fresh angle on cosmic unity through library metaphor demonstrate exceptional synthesis.</comment>
