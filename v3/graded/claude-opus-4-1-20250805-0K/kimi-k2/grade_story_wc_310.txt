I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through pattern, repetition, and density toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mira's alignment retroactively creates the universe's beginning.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's "quiet enthusiasm" despite "stellar doubt" creates genuine internal contradiction that plays out through concrete actions with the coins. The final choice to dissolve into the wavelength she aligned shows earned transformation with visible cost—she gives up individual existence to become the universe's first note.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The backwards prophecy structure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira's present alignment becomes the light that started everything, with clear cost (her dissolution). The accumulative pattern of coin arrangements building to wavelength alignment holds consistently, though the dense conceptual layering occasionally obscures immediate causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck functions as more than setting—its resinous walls vibrate like a cello body and eventually dissolve with Mira, constraining and enabling her final transformation. Sensory details like "resinous walls holding the last light" and coins humming at different frequencies create vivid, purposeful atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from witnessing to active alignment as the coins' chord shifts from static to Mira's own voice saying "You did align," confirming her agency paradox. The pressure coheres through accumulative revelations that narrow her path to dissolution, with visible cost in her final transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The backwards prophecy concept elegantly explores predestination versus agency—"Nothing mattered, therefore everything did" emerges from concrete action rather than assertion. The final image of Mira's laughter becoming the next universe's first note offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through phrases like "after-time" and "stellar doubt pressed against her thoughts like dark matter." Voice maintains lyric consistency through compression and patterned elision ("You will have aligned"/"You did align") that pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("ambered observatory deck creaked under the weight of after-time"). Some abstract passages like "distillate of purpose suspended in the light" strain clarity, and occasional template structures ("She understood then that...") appear, though momentum generally holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The backwards prophecy concept and post-contraction universe setting offer fresh angles on time paradox stories. Specific details like "copper drachma from Andromeda's ninth empire" and the coins becoming a lens create originality through synthesis rather than surface novelty.</comment>
