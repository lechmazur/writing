Looking at this story through an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through pattern and repetition toward a resonant transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "teach endings how to begin" manifests through concrete actions—spinning the disc, guiding confessions through loops, and ultimately dissolving into the network. Her final choice to dial her own number shows contradictory impulses (maintaining distance vs. connection) resolved through self-erasure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully: Mara's dissolution into "the interval between two notes" transforms her from operator to infrastructure, with clear cost (loss of physical form). The accumulative pattern of wrong numbers → confessions → transformations holds throughout, with Lila's morning humming confirming the reconfiguration's reach.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tunnel setting actively constrains choices—"no exit on the schematic" mirrors Mara's trapped state and necessitates her transformation. The glass harmonica disc functions as micro-setting, its four-note loop threading through cables and ultimately seeding the entire city's infrastructure, making environment inseparable from resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: wrong numbers arrive earlier, the disc's loop grows louder and spreads through cables, Mara works faster, until "estrangement turning inside out" forces her self-dissolution. The cost is unmistakable—Mara sacrifices physical existence to become pure connective tissue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ledger's "Endings"/"Begin" columns and crystallizes when Mara realizes teaching transformation "required she, too, step through a transformed door." The final image—commuters hearing the four-note phrase as "every terminus is a disguised origin"—offers a non-literal answer about transformation requiring dissolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric control through purposeful compression ("voices looking for daughters, lovers, or dead men who had never lived here") and rhythmic precision. The perceptual signature—Mara experiencing the tunnel through sound and vibration—remains consistent even as she dissolves into pure interval.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with high information density, though some figurative density in peak beats ("melodically haunted," "lullaby remembering it had once been a scream") occasionally tips toward overwriting. The final image elegantly compresses meaning: "every terminus is a disguised origin."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of phone operator as psychopomp, glass harmonica as transformation engine, and wrong numbers as confessional creates genuine freshness. The concept of "cultivated estrangement" transforming into connection through dissolution offers a non-obvious take on isolation/connection themes.</comment>
