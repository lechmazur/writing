<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The half-masked line walker's grief and determination are embodied through the darkened gauze and her ritual of diagonal stepping, creating a concrete character-particular response to loss. Her final shift from "mourning to stewardship" represents genuine internal change earned through the consecration ritual. However, the monks remain functional rather than individualized, and some emotional transitions ("strangely honest about the sorrow") lean toward telling rather than embodied showing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (diagonal lines, conjured clearings, echo preservation) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where wisdom transforms from ephemeral echo to perpetual communal presence. The cost is legible in the surrender of control ("preservation meant surrendering control") and the walker's transformation to stewardship. Orientation anchors (pavilion, desert, prophet's departure) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet functions as active setting—its floating stones paint sigils, it breathes and adjusts pitch like a tuning fork, and ultimately houses the preserved memory as "a single silver speck." The murmuring pavilion with its "silk diaphragms inhaling wind" creates whisperfield calm that enables the ritual. These environmental elements directly constrain and enable the consecration, particularly when the parapet's vibration divides the echo into twelve shards.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal grief (tears on gauze) through ritual attempt (drawing the diagonal line) to successful communal preservation (twelve shards distributed). The walker's agency drives the transformation through her diagonal stepping ability and gloved hand gesture. Cost is visible in the surrender of control and the shift from individual mourning to collective stewardship, with the final image of perpetual revision showing ongoing price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of preservation requiring surrender—"preservation meant surrendering control"—and wisdom becoming communal rather than individual. The conjured clearings represent spaces outside mapped reality where memory can transform. The ending's "perpetually revised" echo that remains "strangely honest and forever calm" offers a non-literal answer about how wisdom persists through communal holding rather than individual ownership.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Distinct mythic-poetic voice with controlled elevated diction ("kinetic parapet," "whisperfield calm") that maintains consistency. Some phrases achieve memorable texture ("the ceiling of silk diaphragms inhaling wind and turning it into quieter wind"). However, register occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("the strange honesty within her shift from mourning to stewardship") and several constructions feel overwrought rather than precise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strong moments of sensory precision ("salt in the air brush their lashes," "bird-sized light casting moving syllables") but hampered by abstract phrasing ("testament kept strangely honest") and occasional opacity. Several sentences perform double duty effectively, but others drift into elevated diction without clear payoff ("preparing to surface whenever the desert needed freshly sharpened silence"). No major loops or scaffolding, but density sometimes obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of ritual magic, desert monastery, and memory preservation creates a fresh angle on wisdom transmission. The specific mechanism of diagonal stepping into unmapped spaces to conjure clearings feels original. The image of preserved wisdom as "a single silver speck" that perpetually revises itself through communal holding transforms the expected arc of loss and recovery.</comment>
