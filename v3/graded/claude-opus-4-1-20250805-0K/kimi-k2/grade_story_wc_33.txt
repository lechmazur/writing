I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and symbolic resonance rather than strict causal turns, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where promises transform from broken to mending.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Six's motivation to "foster something the war had orphaned: trust" drives consistent character-specific choices, from refusing to salute flags to his nightly deliveries. The contradictory impulses between duty and rebellion manifest through concrete actions like uncorking the storm bottle "just enough" and his measured interactions with Lila. Minor deduction for the father's slightly convenient response timing, though the emotional truth of mending resonates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the father's button and note ("Tell her I'm learning to mend what I broke"), transforming the premise from linking absences to fostering presence. The accumulative texture builds through storm/promise imagery, with visible cost in Lila's three lost birthdays and Six's disputed territory navigation. The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3, and the textural lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade functions as more than backdrop—its "dying fireflies" neon, dormant machines, and maintenance tunnels constrain and enable Six's courier work. Sensory details like "solder and ozone" smell and the "popcorn and rust" tunnel create lived-in specificity. The setting doesn't quite reach 8+ because while atmospheric, it could pressure choices more directly beyond providing routes and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through textural deepening: from the storm's "impatience to be free" through Lila's traced letters to the final synchronization of "storm and soldier, both learning the same rhythm of return." The dominant stake—reconnecting separated families—tightens when Six accepts both delivery and return, with cost visible in the "three birthdays ago" absence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of the bottled storm learning "remembrance" rather than rage, paralleling how promises reroute rather than break. The final image of checkpoint lights transforming from "threats" to "lanterns guiding the lost home" offers a non-literal answer to whether broken promises can heal. Subtext operates beautifully through the copper token "for the toll where broken promises heal."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a distinct poetic register with controlled rhythm ("cobalt arcade at twilight smelled of solder and ozone"). Perceptual signature shows in how Six notices military infrastructure through a courier's eyes—borders as "chalk lines," checkpoints as navigation puzzles. Minor compression occurs under peak moments but the voice texture remains consistent and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly lands ("thunderstorm in a bottle," "guilty thought" for the drone) though occasionally dense ("respectfully rebellious" appears three times). Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some mild template cadence in the middle section ("Six nodded...Six knelt...Six felt") costs points, though the prose achieves genuine momentum and the closing images resonate without loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of magical realism (bottled storm) with war-zone mail delivery offers a fresh angle on separation/connection themes. The specific detail of using arcade maintenance tunnels for smuggling routes and the copper token economy shows authentic imagination. While the broken promises metaphor isn't entirely novel, the execution through concrete particulars like the Space Invaders marquee and the storm learning to sing elevates it.</comment>
