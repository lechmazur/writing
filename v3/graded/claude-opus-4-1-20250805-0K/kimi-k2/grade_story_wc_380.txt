I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through sensory layering, pattern accumulation, and density increase toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara recovers lost memories.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to recover her mother's deleted memories drives concrete actions through embodied grief ("blade behind her ribs"). The final choice to taste the memory droplet shows agency with visible cost. Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("her need to know...sharpened") rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from whale's death through gravity pockets to the memory vault, with Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara accesses the pooled memories. The tasting of memory creates visible cost and transformation. Slight opacity around the gravity-memory connection mechanics prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber and memory vault constrain Mara's choices through fluctuating gravity that forces physical adaptation ("lifted onto the balls of her feet...knees toward buckling"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("brine and lilacs"). Environment directly enables the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation works through density increase as gravity anomalies intensify from pier to chamber to vault, forcing Mara's physical and emotional descent. The cost is visible when she tastes the memory. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images of preservation—pressed flowers, salt crystals, memory droplets—without stating its thesis. The final image of tasting memory offers a non-literal answer about recovering what's lost. Minor deduction for slightly convenient symbolic alignment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("someone who measured darkness in wicks and shadows") with controlled psychic distance. Voice maintains consistency through pressure. Slight register elevation in places ("exhume what the mind had buried") doesn't fully match Mara's working-class perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and information density. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("gleaming silence" appears twice) and some elevated diction clusters ("lilacs...translucent salt columns...imprisoning"). No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of memory preservation through salt crystallization and gravity pockets creates an original world-logic. The coffee grounds divination and pressed wildflowers avoid cliché through specific integration. Doesn't quite reach exceptional due to some familiar beats in the descent narrative.</comment>
