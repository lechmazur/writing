I'll evaluate this story systematically according to the rubric.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - The story builds through layered images of dust motes, paper trails, and recurring motifs that accumulate meaning toward the final release of the birds.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's contradictory impulses (preserving lost songs vs. rewriting history) act simultaneously throughout, with embodied details like "finger-tapped rhythms against the cages." The final choice to burn the papers and release the birds is earned through prior accumulation of her relationship with truth and memory. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("trust was a cracked thing").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as Liora burns her false documents and releases the birds, with visible cost in "the ash rose in delicate spirals." The accumulative lens holds consistently through dust mote patterns, paper trails, and bird imagery. The return of the pigeons "one by one" crystallizes her acceptance of truth over fabrication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The attic setting constrains choices effectively - the skylight controls both dust motes and bird release, the narrow stairs isolate Liora. Sensory details like "lavender she used to calm the pigeons" and "feathers snowed down among the dust" are purposeful. The brass cages "salvaged from war hospitals" add specificity that matters to the war/music tension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through the cat killing the youngest pigeon, triggering Liora's week of document rewriting - a clear tightening that narrows her relationship with truth. The boy's letter with "a photograph of a bombed concert hall" forces final confrontation. Cost is visible in releasing the meteorite chip and burning the documents, though escalation could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus self-invention emerges through concrete images rather than statement. The child's drawing of "a pigeon carrying a violin in its beak" perfectly synthesizes the story's elements. "Trust begins where the song ends" resonates without moralizing. The final image of pigeons returning "one by one" offers a non-literal answer about accepting one's true self.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm: "Every dawn she climbed the narrow stairs, balanced on the top rung." POV remains stable with Liora's selective perception of dust motes as musical notation. Dialogue between Liora and Monsieur Vidal carries effective subtext - "I know" reveals his awareness all along.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("trust was a cracked thing," "spines cracked like old bells") and occasional abstraction. Strong moments like "dust motes could swirl like notes above the rafters" balance weaker passages. Minor template cadence in middle sections but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courier pigeons with lost musicianship creates originality. The mars meteorite chip as false compass/true memory object shows ingenuity. The transformation of dust motes into musical notation, then maps, then faces offers a non-obvious angle on memory and identity.</comment>
