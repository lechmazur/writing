I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered discoveries and sensory accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara transforms from collector to courier.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from compulsive collector to courier is earned through concrete discoveries, with her sensitively perceptive nature manifesting in tactile interactions with walls and tapestry. The contradiction between her need to preserve and the walls' need to return stories creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "bronze quiet" and occasional emotional summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds through diary discoveries to the revelation that walls return rather than keep stories, with Elara's transformation to courier as the Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost is visible in her empty-handedness and release of her collecting compulsion. The pattern of reading, discovering, and returning creates clear escalation under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The silo library setting actively constrains and enables choices—walls that taste fabric, store memories, and sing them back. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("bronze quiet," "silk stiff with centuries"). The displaced axis affecting weather inside the silo shows environmental consequence. Some spatial choreography could be clearer in the middle sections.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating diary discoveries, each adding pressure until Elara finds her own unremembered diary, forcing the question "If walls remember, do they also forgive?" The cost manifests in her relinquishing her role as collector. Stakes deepen appropriately for the textural lens, though the middle section could tighten slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of reading stories back to walls—memory as reciprocal rather than possessive. The dragons listening rather than breathing fire creates a powerful counter-image. The final insight "Stories are not chains but wings" reweights the entire narrative without moralizing, earned through Elara's physical interaction with the space.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("bronze quiet wrapping around her like a second skin"). Some register elevation in places ("sensitively perceptive fibers") that slightly strains the POV. The prose modulates effectively with discovery beats, though occasional filter constructions ("She felt," "She understood") reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong image density. Some repetitive phrasing around "bronze quiet" (5 instances) and "sensitively perceptive" creates mild template cadence. Filter verb clusters in discovery moments ("She understood then," "She felt," "She realized") reduce immediacy. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with library-as-living-memory creates genuine originality. The concept of walls that must return rather than keep stories inverts expected collector narrative. The specific detail of dragons listening rather than breathing, and Elara's unremembered diary, show strong imaginative reach beyond template post-apocalyptic fiction.</comment>
