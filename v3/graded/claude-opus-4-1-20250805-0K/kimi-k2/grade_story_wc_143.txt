<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crater inspector's motivation is concrete and embodied through specific actions—climbing through thinning atmosphere, carrying the sand grain, calibrating the chemical timer. Her "purposefully curious" nature drives meaningful micro-choices under pressure, particularly embedding the grain in the capsule as both timer and memorial. The emotional progression from professional curiosity to "rising grief" feels earned through accumulated detail about the station's abandonment and the orchid's extinction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered details toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the orchid's brief bloom and the capsule's violet flash create a charged moment of preservation against extinction. The closure lands with visible cost—the orchid will die, the grain vaporizes, but the photograph captures both. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2, and the countdown structure provides clean causality through the chemical timer's calibration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The moonlit summit setting directly constrains choice through thin atmosphere, cold draining the camera battery, and the precise terminator line timing. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"dawning hush," frost crystallizing into "brief ghosts," the orchid's "frostbitten silk" petals. The crater functions as both wound and cradle, its sixty-year history linking to the inspector's birth year, making the environment inseparable from the emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—photographing the last ghost orchid before extinction—is signaled early and tightens through the countdown structure. Agency manifests through deliberate choices: calibrating the timer, embedding the grain, steadying for the shot. The seven-minute bloom window creates genuine pressure that forecloses options, and the cost is legible when the violet flash matches the orchid's bloom—both beautiful and terminal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the hourglass grain measuring absence, the orchid as "final argument against extinction," the crater as wound-become-cradle. The ending's dual bloom (orchid and chemical flash) offers a non-literal answer about preservation through witness. The orbital gardens' history and the inspector's lifetime of measuring wounds without healing them create thematic depth without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature through scientific precision ("potassium permanganate and glycerin") combined with poetic observation ("love letter from the planet's core"). No dialogue allows full focus on interiority. Psychic distance modulates effectively, pulling close for "I will not let you vanish unseen" then widening for cosmic perspective. The controlled rhythm accelerates through the countdown without losing clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The crater was young, only sixty years old" establishes timeline, scale, and emotional resonance. Sentence variety creates natural rhythm, from short declarations ("Twenty minutes remained") to complex observations. Minor repetition of "ghost" (ghostly, ghost-white) and some filter constructions ("She thought of," "She remembered") prevent higher scoring but don't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of crater inspector as grief witness, the chemical timer as both practical tool and memorial device, and the orchid blooming at vacuum creates a fresh constellation. The grain's transformation from timekeeper to violet streak elevates beyond prompt assembly. Risk-taking through the accumulative structure and quiet ending pays off with the dual bloom image that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
