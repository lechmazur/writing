I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through sensory layers and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elian releases the perfume and transforms from broker to planter.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's transformation from commodifier to guardian is earned through embodied grief ("slow collapse of his shoulders") and concrete memory of his mother. The contradiction between selling memories and understanding their true value drives authentic internal conflict. Minor deduction for slight emotional smoothness in the resolution's completeness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elian releases the perfume, transforming from seller to planter of remembrance gardens. Cost is visible in his tears and the emptying of his livelihood. Accumulative structure coheres well though the final incomplete sentence weakens impact slightly. Who/where/when anchored early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse constrains and enables choices - its "glass panes sweating violet dew" and UV lamps revealing extinct plants create atmospheric pressure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("fragrance so delicate it felt like the exhale of a sleeping child"). Setting actively participates in the transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving vs. releasing memory) deepens through Elian's realization that "every fragrance he had brokered had been a seed planted in strangers' hearts." The release decision carries visible cost in abandoning his trade. Escalation is more textural than causal, appropriate to the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the midnight cereus transformation and Elian's journey from commodification to understanding "every scent is a seed, and every tear is rain." The final image of him planting "gardens of remembrance" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "aromatically cautious" and selective sensory focus. Some register elevation in peak moments ("silent bell," "invisible roots") slightly exceeds POV lexicon. Rhythm modulates well with emotional intensity though occasional overwriting intrudes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, figurative language density in peak beats ("fragrance burst outward like a silent bell") and some template phrasing ("Years later, travelers speak") create mild overwriting. The incomplete final sentence is a technical error.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of extinct plant greenhouse with fragrance brokering feels fresh and specific. The transformation from lantern broker to memory gardener offers a non-obvious angle. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode mostly succeeds though doesn't fully transcend its prompt elements.</comment>
