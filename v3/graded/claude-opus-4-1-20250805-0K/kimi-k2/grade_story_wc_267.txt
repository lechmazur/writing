<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bellhop's internal conflict between "frostbitten hope" and "the warmth of forgetting" drives a genuine choice with visible cost. His transformation from nameless extension of the fortress to speaking "Enough" earns its weight through accumulated embodied details (numb fingers, returning nerves). Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract handling of memory/danger relationship before the final crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (bolt appearing, crack widening, gate manifesting) that reweight the fortress's true nature. The Decisive Change lands with clear cost: the fortress crumbles as the bellhop chooses memory over safety. The upward-falling snow and transformation from "cobalt fortress under snow" to "stone under stars" provides resonant closure with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fortress functions as both setting and antagonist, its cobalt walls that "swallow screams" constraining every choice. Sensory details (dusty spiral staircase, bruised lavender discoloration, frosting breath) are selective and purposeful. The setting's evolution from sealed system to cracking walls directly enables and reflects the protagonist's transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine duty through discovered anomaly (bolt) to existential choice between safety/forgetting. The fortress's revelation that it "devoured memory of danger" reframes all prior details and forces the binary decision. Cost is legible in the fortress's destruction and the bellhop's acceptance of remembered screams.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the bolt's keyhole crack, the fortress devouring memory, the final word "Enough." The story offers a non-literal answer about the price of safety without moralizing. The transformation of "cobalt fortress under snow" to "stone under stars" reweights the entire premise with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through selective attention (counting steps by discoloration, feeling bolt threads like "tiny teeth"). Voice maintains lyric compression throughout with controlled rhythm. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("seraphically mundane") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon during non-peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("His name was erased when he took the post"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("snow that tasted of salt and old songs") without clear payoff. Template cadence appears briefly ("He could...Or he could...") but the overall prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fortress as memory-devourer offers a fresh angle on safety/danger dialectics. The bolt as mundane object bearing transcendent message transforms expected gothic elements. Risk-taking through lyric compression and the reversal of snow falling upward distinguishes the piece while maintaining clarity.</comment>
