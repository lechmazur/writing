I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, analyzing each category for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's grief-driven motivation is embodied through concrete actions (carrying the ribbon, reading poems, carving) with internal contradiction between needing help and working alone. The spectral mother adds relational pressure that forces choices. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution where understanding arrives too smoothly ("Mara understood the lesson").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara transforms from isolated grief to communal practice. The butterfly migration patterns becoming carving guides creates causal linkage. Cost is visible in weeks of labor and the emotional price of releasing individual grief for collective healing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively shapes choices—glass panes vibrate, pollen drifts, butterflies form vortexes. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (wet loam, bruised citrus). The carved stone's grooves that "caught rain and reflected sky" demonstrate environment constraining outcome, though some descriptions edge toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal grief to village-wide healing through the deepening understanding of grief as migration. The spectral mentor's increasing clarity tracks with Mara's progress. Cost accumulates through weeks of work, though the resolution feels slightly predetermined rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor: "grief is not a monument but a migration." The recurring ribbon/poem tradition deepens meaning without explicit moralizing. The final image of grief as "a flock taking shape against the sky" offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("monarchs...brushed her cheeks like warm ash"). Some register drift into elevated diction during emotional peaks ("fiercely meditative," "thundering calm") that occasionally strains against naturalism. POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature focused on texture and craft.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has moments of beauty but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears too frequently in high-pressure beats without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in the repetitive "She [verb]" constructions. The phrase "thundering calm" repeats four times, creating unnecessary echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief work through physical craft (gravestone carving) and natural cycles (butterfly migration). The spectral mentorship avoids cliché through specific detail. The transformation of traditional poem-trading into communal healing practice shows genuine originality, though some metaphors feel familiar.</comment>
