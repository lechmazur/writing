<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to map memories onto the nautilus shell to access lost symphonies is clear and drives concrete actions throughout. Her "chronologically homesick" state manifests in embodied ways—pressing the shell to her ear, hurrying to pin memories before exhaustion hits. The final choice to step through the mirrored horizon and pass the shell to her younger self carries visible cost (exhaustion as "gentle downbeat") and forecloses her adult existence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with memories accumulating on the shell's spiral until critical mass triggers the lake's transformation. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when adult and child selves merge through the shell's transfer, with exhaustion as the explicit cost. The mirrored horizon concept anchors orientation early and pays off when she steps through it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass spire and frozen lake create a liminal space that constrains action (no doors, arrival only by remembering). Sensory details are selective and purposeful—"ink distilled from auroras," the shell's warmth, the lake as "unbroken staff of ice." The nautilus shell functions as micro-setting that enables the central transformation, though some descriptions edge toward ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each mapped memory intensifies the shell's response—from "low hum" to glowing chambers to the lake cracking. The dominant stake (accessing childhood's unheard symphonies) tightens as "tomorrow's exhaustion already reaching for her wrists" creates urgency. Cost is visible when exhaustion finally claims her as she completes the transfer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the nautilus spiral as metaphor for time/memory without explicit statement. The father's line "music is only time folded small enough to hold" resonates through action as memories literally fold into the shell's chambers. The ending reweights all prior mapping as preparation for this moment of self-reunion without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"chronologically homesick," "upturned hush," "frozen exclamation." POV remains stable in close third with consistent psychic distance. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("ink distilled from auroras") but serve the dreamlike atmosphere. Perceptual signature is strong in how she experiences time as doubled/mirrored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose has moments of genuine beauty but occasional overwriting—"the upturned hush of sound turning itself inside out" strains clarity. Some template repetition in memory-mapping sequence (at X whorls, she placed Y). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. The closing image effectively synthesizes all elements though some middle passages feel dense without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The chronologically homesick fortune cookie writer mapping memories onto a nautilus shell offers fresh synthesis. The mirrored horizon as portal between temporal selves transforms a familiar time-travel concept through specific imagery. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure and non-linear time pays off, though the fortune cookie writer aspect feels somewhat ornamental to the core action.</comment>
