I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered iterations and parallel universe encounters toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lira sets down the burden of infinite cycles.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's internal conflict between mapping and carrying the pilot's message manifests through embodied sensation ("tasting the metal's memory," "weight of a withheld truth pressed against her ribs"). The final choice to embed the shard and walk away shows earned renunciation with visible cost—she gives up the infinite possibilities for singular peace.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira embeds the shard, breaking the cycle with clear cost: "threads in a tapestry she would spend her life weaving." The accumulative structure coheres as each universe encounter builds toward understanding the pilot's sacrifice, though the orientation takes ~150 words to fully anchor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The repair bay functions as more than backdrop—its "gantries and fuel lines rusting into the silence" create the liminal space where realities fold. The green glass shard's fracture lines that "rearranged themselves, showing new constellations" provides the physical constraint driving choices, though some descriptions lean abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: first the bay folds, then parallel Liras appear, then the pilot's death reveals itself, culminating in Lira's choice to break the cycle. The cost is legible when she "knelt on the oil-stained deck and pressed the glass into a crack," though middle beats could tighten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between infinite possibility and singular truth—the pilot's withheld knowledge that "could not survive" becomes Lira's burden across realities. The final image of "spaces between them, where truths wait to be spoken" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the cyclical journey.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains dreamlike consistency with phrases like "murmur of half-remembered dreams" and sensory-forward perception. Some passages drift toward abstraction ("threads in a tapestry she would spend her life weaving") that slightly dilute the distinctive sensory-mapper perspective established early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves lyrical momentum but suffers from abstract density in places: "the weight of the withheld truth settling into her bones" and similar metaphorical constructions accumulate without always advancing concrete detail. The filtering through "felt," "heard," "knew" occasionally dulls immediacy, particularly in the resolution sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of a sensory cartographer mapping parallel universes through a glass shard offers fresh territory. The specific detail of "star charts bloomed holographically, each map a sensory tapestry of scent and sound rather than light" transforms the familiar multiverse trope through particularized worldbuilding.</comment>
