I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through lyric density and pattern accumulation rather than causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The poet's motivation crystallizes through embodied details like "the old ache return—the need to stride through boundaries" and her transformation from frozen certainty to flowing song. Internal contradiction appears when she simultaneously dissolves and maintains form ("both inside and outside"). The final renunciation of echo/return shows earned cost through her acceptance of permanent transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when "Certainty no longer tremored; it sang" and she dissolves into light-columns, paying the cost of physical form. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through repeated boundary dissolutions. Orientation anchors clearly (poet, atrium, frozen lake) and the pattern teaches itself through quartz harmonics and inversions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The quartz colonnade functions as active setting, recognizing her pulse and responding to her paraphrase by "dimming its glow, inviting her inward." Spatial choreography remains coherent as she moves through pillars to lake. The inverted lake-sky creates vertical doubling that constrains her final choice between forms. Environment directly enables transformation through resonant frequencies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from breaking a ban to dissolving identity itself, with the tremor steadying into song marking genuine transformation. The poet's agency drives each boundary crossing, from touching pillar to speaking aloud to walking on water. Cost becomes visible when she loses physical form to become "columns of light that rose and scattered."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete paradox "borders are only weather in slow motion" paying off in her final dissolution into mist. The ending reweights "No echo shall return—because the echo is already home" as acceptance rather than prohibition. Subtext operates through the lake's impossible physics and the notebook writing itself, avoiding explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature appears in synesthetic descriptions like "lantern-moth hush that clung to every surface like a secret" and "Words pooled in her mouth, tasting of iron and snow." Voice maintains lyric consistency through elevated but coherent diction. The pattern of paradox ("frozen lake that was no longer frozen") teaches itself and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density high with lines like "pillars singing in frequencies that made the ice beneath them shiver into lace" doing multiple jobs. Some register elevation ("colonnade's ellipse," "membrane") but it serves the mythic tone. Minor repetition in "aesthetically driven" (appears twice) and slight overwriting in extended metaphors, though the lyric mode earns most flourishes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of language-bans dissolving through paraphrase offers fresh angle on transformation narratives. The inverted lake-ceiling and self-writing notebook create specific, non-stock imagery. Risk-taking appears in the commitment to sustained lyric abstraction and the choice to dissolve rather than restore the protagonist.</comment>
