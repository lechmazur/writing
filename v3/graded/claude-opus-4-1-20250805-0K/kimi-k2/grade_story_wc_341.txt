<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to prove "empty spaces remember" drives compelling internal conflict through concrete embodied details like the telescope growing warm in response. The transformation from data-driven scientist to emotional cartographer is earned through specific loss (mentor's death, broken tether) with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("spooled wholeness made manifest") that briefly loses embodiment in middle beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Conceptual Repricing closure—Mira's discovery that atmosphere is a "memory palace" reweights her entire worldview with professional and personal cost visible in her commitment to teach others. The broken tether creates immediate pressure that forces her emotional cloud taxonomy work. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the gondola situation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The brass telescope functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image as "sacred relic." Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's meteorological expertise through specific cloud types (cumulus, cirrus, altocumulus) filtered through emotional perception. The gondola's shadow as sundial and "dusty starlight thickening around clouds" create vivid atmospheric pressure that shapes her revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The broken tether creates coherent pressure forcing Mira to confront her mentor's teachings about emotional cloud signatures. One meaningful deepening occurs when she recognizes herself in the cumulus—this discovery narrows her options to either dismiss or embrace this new understanding. Cost is visible in her career pivot, though middle escalation could tighten further between recognition and resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery that "empty spaces remember what once filled them," avoiding abstract philosophizing. The brass telescope's transformation from measurement tool to bridge between "what was and what remains" offers resonant non-literal answer. Strong subtext in clouds holding specific emotional memories (father leaving, first kiss) without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through meteorological lens—Mira categorizes emotions like weather patterns. Voice modulates effectively from scientific observation to emotional recognition to direct address of clouds. Some register drift into elevated diction ("spooled wholeness," "memorial more lasting than stone") that occasionally strains against the established scientific voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "clouds gathered like mourners at a funeral she hadn't been invited to attend." Template cadence appears in middle section with repeated "how the [cloud type] [verb]" constructions. Some abstract phrasing ("spooled wholeness made manifest") and slight overwriting in figurative density reduces clarity in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology and emotional memory creates non-obvious angle on grief and professional transformation. The concept of categorizing clouds by emotion rather than formation offers genuine originality. Specific detail like "forty-seven distinct emotional signatures" grounds the fantastical premise in scientific methodology.</comment>
