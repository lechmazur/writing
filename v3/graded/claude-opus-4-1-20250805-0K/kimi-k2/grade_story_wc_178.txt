Looking at this story through a **Causal lens** - the narrative follows clear because/therefore linkages as Naram-Sin's investigation of the magic square tile leads him to discover and activate the palace's hidden engine, ultimately sacrificing his future astronomical work to maintain cosmic order.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Naram-Sin's motivation is crystalline - his desire for certainty about cosmic continuity drives every action, and his final sacrifice (surrendering his star-charts and future discoveries) carries genuine weight. The characterization succeeds through specific details like "sandals mended with waxed thread" and his mistrust of gifts while trusting only measurements. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of his internal conflict in the covenant moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The closure lands powerfully as a Decisive Change with clear cost - Naram-Sin permanently sacrifices his ability to count the stars' turns to ensure they continue turning. The causal chain from tile discovery through pattern decoding to covenant signing is impeccable. The final image of him walking away with only his "now useless" quartz lens while the constellation burns steady perfectly encapsulates the price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The palace functions as more than setting - it actively responds to Naram-Sin's work ("wind through empty archways tuned itself to the minor key of his breathing"), and the circular chamber with its obsidian and cedar gears constrains his final choice. The Babylonian details (lapis, ziggurat, cuneiform) create authentic texture. The setting literally transforms to reveal the hidden engine, making it essential to the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake - ensuring cosmic order continues - escalates through Naram-Sin's methodical investigation, with the tile's patterns gradually revealing the palace's secret. The cost becomes visceral when he must sacrifice "all the nights he might have spent naming new comets." The tension between his frugality/empiricism and the mystical covenant creates authentic pressure that narrows to a single irreversible choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of devotion versus empiricism emerges organically through Naram-Sin's actions - the "lock that listens for the right devotion" requires him to surrender his empirical practice of cataloguing stars. The irony that he must give up counting to ensure continuity resonates without being stated. The final image of the Crooked Staff constellation "as if it had never been lost" perfectly encapsulates the theme of necessary sacrifice for larger order.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice maintains elegant control with distinctive rhythm ("columns that once sang with lapis now hummed with the low bronze of twilight") and precise diction that reflects Naram-Sin's scholarly perspective. The prose modulates beautifully from contemplative observation to the urgency of discovery. Particularly strong is how mathematical/astronomical language infuses the narration ("each diagonal a corridor, each sum a hidden pressure point").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose achieves remarkable density with lines doing multiple jobs - "sandals mended with waxed thread and coat patched at the elbows" simultaneously establishes character, economic state, and the interregnum period. No loops or scaffolding detected. The figurative language enhances rather than obscures ("labyrinth of dusk and silence," "walls were lined with lapis mosaics of bulls wearing stars for eyes").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of Babylonian astronomical tradition with magical realism feels fresh and inevitable - a magic square that rearranges with moonlight, a palace that contains a cosmic engine. The specific detail of "charcoal ground from date pits" and the Crooked Staff constellation "which no scribe had recorded for three centuries" creates authenticity. The concept of sacrificing personal glory for cosmic continuity offers a non-obvious take on the devotion theme.</comment>
