I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication.

**Drive Lens Inference**: This operates as an **Accumulative/Textural** design, building density through layered discoveries about the orchard's memorial nature, with the arrow tip serving as the recurring object that accumulates meaning through the piece.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation crystallizes through embodied discovery—the vibrating arrow tip, pulse like "distant surf," and final integration create genuine progression. The character moves from harvest pilot to memorial keeper through concrete choices. Minor deduction for slightly convenient epiphany timing when touching the arrow.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kael's action transforms the grove and her role, with visible cost in the "whirling silence" and permanent change to the orchard. The accumulative structure builds through echo discoveries to the sapling revelation. Slight dock for the convenience of the final notch fitting perfectly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional world-building where inverted rivers, floating arches, and luminous spores create a lived-in alien ecology that directly constrains navigation and timing. The environment actively shapes every choice, from glider navigation to the gravity deadline. Setting functions as character through the memorial landscape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure—from data gathering to echo detection to the vortex navigation under time constraint. The gravity return creates genuine urgency. Cost is visible in the risk taken and the transformation's permanence, though the protagonist faces minimal personal loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the discovery that "resilience was not botanical but memorial"—courage literally feeds growth. The braided arrow tips as living core and "endure" resonating from leaves avoid platitude through specificity. The merger of memory and biology creates layered meaning without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled technical register ("keel," "echo signature," "accelerated plant growth") that never breaks character. Perceptual signature strong in how Kael reads the planet through pilot's expertise. Clean free indirect style maintains appropriate distance. Minor repetition in "navigating by water flow."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose maintains high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"glided above the silverleaf canopy, leaves now shimmering with embedded flecks of metal." Some filter verb accumulation ("caught her eye," "felt," "heard") slightly dulls immediacy. Strong momentum throughout with varied syntax supporting scene rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of botanical science fiction with memorial/memory storage is genuinely fresh—arrows that "sang as they flew" becoming growth catalysts. The inverted gravity rivers and upward-flowing spores create an original ecosystem. Risk-taking in the lyric compression pays off with coherent world logic maintained throughout.</comment>
