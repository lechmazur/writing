<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's contradictory impulses between chronicler's duty and personal pain act simultaneously throughout, particularly when touching the cicada triggers memory over data. The siblings' final choice to read the unmailed letter together carries visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("transition periods," "forgiveness begins") in interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and memory fragments build toward the Resonant Reconfiguration of siblings reconnecting through shared grief. The unmailed letter revelation reweights their mother's silence with conceptual cost ("decided silence was kinder"). Closure lands with felt cost as they process the letter together, though the final chronicler's note edges toward explicit theme statement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto functions as emotional crucible, its tidal rhythms mirroring the siblings' relationship cycles. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (barnacles like coins, phosphorescent footprints). The jade cicada's color shifts constrain perception and enable memory-sharing, directly shaping the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of family fracture deepens through the cicada's revelation of the unmailed letter, forcing siblings to confront their mother's choice. Mara's arrival escalates pressure ("can't bear another silence"). Cost is visible in tears salting the stone and the suspended conversation, though agency remains somewhat passive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of time's texture emerges through tidepool metaphor without explicit moralizing until the final lines. The cicada as memory-holder and the grotto as pause-space develop the concept through concrete images. Minor deduction for the explicit "Time's texture is the space between heartbeats when forgiveness begins" which articulates thesis too directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in Elian's chronicler habits filtering experience ("notebook damp with spray," "salinity, iodine scent"). Prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in the memory sequence. Dialogue is minimal but natural ("I followed your footprints"). Some register elevation in peak moments ("tangential approach") slightly exceeds POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, template cadence appears in "He understood...He touched...He spoke" sequences and some paraphrase loops ("Time feels like this...rough where it breaks, smooth where it holds" restates the tidepool metaphor). Filter verbs cluster in memory sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of tidepool ecology with family estrangement creates non-obvious emotional terrain. The jade cicada as memory-holder rather than fortune-teller subverts expectation. The unmailed letter revelation transforms silence from abandonment to protection, though some elements (phosphorescent footprints, stars pressing windows) edge toward familiar imagery.</comment>
