<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal journey from repair-as-control to repair-as-surrender is earned through embodied struggle with the spinning clock hand, though some transitions between realizations feel slightly rushed. The final transformation where she lets the cameras "repair her" carries genuine emotional cost through the "luminous husk that no longer hurt to hold."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure where the spinning clock hand's meaning deepens from malfunction to escape metaphor to transformative agent, culminating in Elara's Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost is beautifully rendered in "the ache was still there, but it had turned inside out" - a genuine before/after with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lunar observatory setting actively constrains choice through isolation and the moon's tremors that drive urgency. Sensory details like "dust drifted from the rafters like inverted snow" and the mysterious leaf sound create atmosphere while the vacuum's distance from Earth charges Elara's emotional state.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through the moon's intensifying tremors forcing Elara from diagnosis to understanding to surrender, with the spinning hand as both problem and solution. The stakes deepen from technical repair to existential reckoning with "escape velocity" as both physical formula and emotional truth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The escape velocity theme emerges organically through concrete camera mechanics, transforming from physics concept to metaphor for emotional release. The final insight that cameras "repair her" rather than vice versa offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior repair attempts without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression, though occasional register drift into abstract philosophy ("the law of impermanence") momentarily breaks POV consistency. The perceptual signature of a technician reading emotional truth through mechanical symptoms is compelling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with strong imagery but hampered by abstract passages like "escape velocity is not speed but surrender" and some paraphrase loops around the ache/luminous concepts. Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions though the lyric mode partially justifies the pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of camera repair, lunar isolation, and escape velocity physics creates an original emotional metaphor for loss and letting go. The gear train "rearranged into a spiral" and film achieving its own escape velocity show genuine imaginative risk that heightens meaning.</comment>
