I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as the piece builds through pattern, metaphor accumulation, and cadence shifts rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arlen's guilt and need for forgiveness drive consistent micro-choices through the labyrinth. His fingers' "productive fidget" drumming chess openings embodies his compulsion. The final acceptance of "Begin again" shows earned change through accumulated confession, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("winnow the guilt from his soul").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Arlen accepts forgiveness and the village breathes again, with cost visible in "years" of exile and the prodigy's disappearance. The accumulative structure coheres through chess/weaving metaphors. Deducting for slight ambiguity around the prodigy's actual fate and whether the labyrinth experience is literal or psychological.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The time-frozen village and platinum labyrinth constrain Arlen's journey effectively. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("metal's chill kiss his ribs"). The tapestry's frayed threads become active setting elements that must be decoded, directly shaping his path through the maze.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on Arlen's need for forgiveness, with the labyrinth forcing confession through each corridor. The prodigy's appearance and king-tipping gesture provides the key reversal. Cost is visible in years of exile, though the resolution feels slightly convenient with the village's sudden animation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through chess/weaving metaphors: rigid instruction versus organic growth. The "woven hush" of unspoken apologies resonates without stating morals. The final image of threads "weaving themselves into a new border, the pattern yet to be played" beautifully reweights the opening without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm throughout. Perceptual signature strong in chess-filtered observations ("naming squares under his breath"). Some elevated diction ("fierce repose") fits the fable-like tone, though occasionally risks purple territory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deducting for occasional overwriting ("polished regret," "productive fidget") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("winnow the guilt from his soul").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The chess tutor entering a metaphysical labyrinth to decode guilt offers fresh angle on redemption narrative. The synthesis of chess, weaving, and time-frozen village creates specific texture. Risk-taking in the surreal elements pays off, though the resolution edges toward expected.</comment>
