I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This operates as an Accumulative/Textural piece, building through layered imagery (sea glass, stones, letters, flask) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias bottles the widow's ache and commits to keeping the light.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's reticent nature manifests through concrete actions—pressing sea glass to palm, stacking stones, bottling the ache—with contradictory impulses between skepticism ("believed in tides, not ghosts") and acceptance. The widow functions effectively as atmospheric pressure rather than a full character. Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("the ache in the ink glowed") rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias bottles the widow's ache and commits to lighthouse-keeping, with visible cost in accepting supernatural responsibility. The accumulative lens holds as images (sea glass, stones, flask) layer toward the final transformation. Minor orientation wobble in the opening's dense metaphor slightly delays anchoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lantern room setting directly constrains choices—the brass chart table holds the letter, the lens cradle receives the sea glass, the balcony rail holds the stones. Sensory specificity excels: "air tasted of salt and lilacs," phosphorescent widow, moonlit skiff. The lighthouse-as-throat metaphor and recurring sea glass create a lived-in maritime world that shapes every action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from lamp repair to spiritual guardianship through the widow's increasing presence and demands ("the balm must be sealed inside something living"). The protagonist's agency drives the resolution—choosing to bottle the ache and continue the letter chain. Cost is visible in accepting supernatural duty, though the middle section could tighten slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the letter chain's philosophy ("be the hand that bottles the balm") actualized in Elias literally bottling safety's feeling. The sea glass transforms from found object to lens offering to final weight. The ending reweights all prior elements without stating a moral, achieving resonance through accumulated particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with maritime specificity ("rigging knife," "skiff's thwart," "bilge") and controlled lyricism. The prose modulates effectively from practical observation to heightened perception of the supernatural. Minor deduction for occasional overwriting ("luminescent ache," "phosphorescence") that slightly weights the figurative over clarity in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong information density with most lines serving multiple functions. Some figurative density issues: "luminescent ache" appears twice, mixed metaphor of "ache drip—slow, silver, luminescent." The "throat that had swallowed the moon" opening, while atmospheric, creates initial opacity. Otherwise clean prose with good momentum and varied syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse-keeping with spiritual guardianship and anonymous care networks. The letter chain concept and stone-stacking communication system offer non-obvious angles. The transformation of traditional ghost story into active acceptance of supernatural duty shows genuine ingenuity, though some elements (widow seeking letter) echo familiar haunting tropes.</comment>
