<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to mend unraveling tapestries through the labyrinth's pattern is clear and consistent, with embodied details like "the stone boat tucked inside her coat" and her transformation from sleepwalker to conscious weaver. The internal journey from seeking external patterns to understanding herself as the loom shows genuine character evolution with visible cost in her fourteen-night ordeal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through nightly walks that culminate in Lira's Resonant Reconfiguration—understanding the labyrinth as loom and herself as shuttle. The closure lands with visible cost (fourteen nights of sleepwalking, the canyon sealing) and transforms her from seeker to weaver who "learned to keep both eyes open while dreaming." The who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The red canyon labyrinth functions as both setting and mechanism, with walls that "shift" and "exhale fine red dust," directly constraining Lira's path and enabling her transformation. Sensory details like "moonlight turning the red walls to bruised velvet" and "the perfume of orchids blooming out of season" create atmosphere while the spiral corridor and pictographs provide specific spatial choreography that shapes her journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mending the pattern of ruin—deepens through Lira's nightly walks as the labyrinth responds with increasing intensity: walls shifting, dust settling, corners softening. The escalation from unconscious sleepwalking to conscious weaving shows agency, with visible cost in the fourteen-night commitment and the canyon's final sealing that forecloses return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of "reweaving from ruin" emerges through concrete imagery—the unraveling tapestries, the labyrinth as loom, the stone boat replacing the paper illustration. The final image of tide pools refilling with "the promise that every unraveling can become a reweaving" offers resonant closure without stating a moral, earning depth through the accumulated textile metaphors and Lira's embodied journey.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lyric voice maintains consistent dream-logic with phrases like "corridors warp and weft" and "her body traced while her mind hovered above like a lantern," creating a distinct perceptual signature. The prose modulates from floating observation to grounded action ("lifted the boat, felt its weight"), with no dialogue to assess but strong control of psychic distance throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("the moonlight struck the illustration so that the painted child's eyes opened, reflecting the canyon's red glow"), though some phrases edge toward purple prose ("bruised velvet," "orchid solace"). The story maintains momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful repetition of weaving imagery, with minor template cadence in the middle sections ("She began," "She placed," "She lifted").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of weaving, dreaming, and pilgrimage creates a fresh angle on transformation narratives, with specific details like the "silver thimble engraved with the word 'remember'" avoiding generic mysticism. The labyrinth-as-loom revelation feels earned through accumulated particulars, though the archetypal journey structure itself is familiar.</comment>
