<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to understand her mother's abandonment through the night-blooming flowers is consistently embodied through concrete actions—spreading postcards, studying etched glass, mixing specific pigments. The shift from "quietly driven by the need to understand" to "the desire to witness" marks genuine character evolution with visible cost in her final acceptance of mystery rather than resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through repeated imagery of moonflowers, postcards, and etched glass until the mother's postcard provides a Resonant Reconfiguration: "They bloom for the dark because the dark remembers them." The cost is felt in Liora's acceptance that connection doesn't require physical presence, though the extended denouement after line 28 slightly dilutes the closure's impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The amber pavilion, cathedral with etched glass window, and moonflowers create a lived-in world where setting actively constrains choices—Liora must wait for darkness to see her paintings bloom, the etched glass teaches her about letting darkness in. The specificity of "lapis ground into violet so deep it looked black until moonlight struck it" exemplifies how environment shapes artistic method and meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why her mother abandoned her through solving the flower mystery—deepens when the hidden postcard reframes absence as a different kind of presence. The cost lands in Liora's shift from needing answers to accepting witness, though the story could have tightened pressure through more active obstacles rather than patient accumulation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically through the interplay of darkness/light, absence/presence, with the mother's note offering a non-literal answer that darkness "remembers" what daylight cannot hold. The final image of moonflowers closing "like a book whose story had finally been read aloud" resonates without stating a moral, reweighting all prior night imagery as forms of memory rather than abandonment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lyrical voice maintains consistency with phrases like "umbral tenderness" and "dawning hush," creating a contemplative register appropriate to the protagonist's artistic sensibility. Some passages drift toward purple prose ("the flame threw her shadow across the nave so that she seemed to stand inside the bloom"), but the perceptual signature remains distinct in how Liora notices light, pigment, and botanical details.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong moments like "pigment and petal breathing together" demonstrate careful line-level craft, but the story suffers from repetitive phrasing—"across the melting of winter's last snow" appears verbatim twice, and multiple sentences begin with "She" in sequence. The extended denouement after the emotional climax creates momentum drag, though individual sentences often achieve lyrical precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of maternal abandonment with night-blooming flowers offers a fresh angle on loss, particularly in the concept that darkness "remembers" what light cannot preserve. The specific detail of painting with translucent oils that only glow in moonlight and the etched glass "cut to let darkness in rather than keep it out" transforms familiar grief narrative through artistic process.</comment>
