<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—preserving versus releasing the past—act throughout the scene, culminating in her choice to leave the quartz but carry the tune forward. The psychometry reading creates embodied, specific interiority ("incubating the emulsion's memories the way a nightjar warms an alien egg"). Her final renunciation of stasis ("She would not follow, but she would no longer stand still") carries visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory and metaphorical density builds toward Mara's resonant reconfiguration—transforming unused love from a fixed deposit to portable potential. The closure lands with felt cost: "love unused is love still, stored in the dark between heartbeats." Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The projection booth functions as more than setting—its "hot carbon and velvet rot" atmosphere constrains Mara's choices, while the dead projector bulb forces her to use the quartz sphere innovatively. Spatial imagination ("balcony as clavicle, aisles as ribs") transforms the theater into an anatomical map of stored emotion. The final dawn rubbing "marquee letters to chalk" charges the ending with temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—deepens through Mara's discovery that love exists "in the interval between frames, the darkness the audience never noticed." The psychometry reading escalates from passive observation to active transformation when she aims the quartz to release Lin's silhouette. Cost is visible but could be sharper in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of film frames and intervals—love stored not in visible moments but in the spaces between. The goodbye letter's transformation from undelivered object to "map back to her own unspent tenderness" offers a non-literal answer to the premise. The final insight that "love unused is love still" reweights all prior searching without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout: Mara processes the world through crystal-gazing vocabulary ("psychometry reading," "incubating memories"). The lyric compression serves the accumulative structure, with controlled rhythm shifts marking emotional peaks ("Frame by frame, the goodbye letter advanced"). No head-hopping; POV remains firmly anchored to Mara's specialized perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The booth's only window framed the dormant screen like a moonlit lake"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("nightjar warms an alien egg," "stalactite") but coherent within the psychometry frame. Minor scaffold in the extended spatial metaphor sequence (balcony/clavicle section) but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychometry, abandoned cinema, and undelivered letters creates a fresh angle on lost love stories. The specific detail of love stored "in the interval between frames" transforms a familiar premise through technical precision. Risk-taking in the lyric structure and extended metaphors heightens resonance without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
