<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by loss and artistic purpose. The encounter with her older self creates genuine internal conflict about time and choice, though the emotional progression feels slightly managed. Her final understanding that "alliances were not chains but spirals" represents earned wisdom through concrete experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural structure with the archway transformation serving as the central organizing principle. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the blank slide revealing the loop's nature, with visible cost in Mara's acceptance of her temporal role. The piece teaches its time-loop pattern early and pays it off, though some middle transitions feel slightly mechanical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway and driftwood effectively constrain choices and create atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("marsh gleamed like polished obsidian"). The archway's transformation from abandoned to "expectant" directly shapes the narrative arc, though some middle passages rely on summary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on rebuilding meaning after catastrophic loss ("GPS failed, world folded"). The older Mara's appearance creates meaningful pressure that forces young Mara to confront her future role. Cost is visible in the acceptance of perpetual return, though middle escalation could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the archway's layered construction and time-loop structure. The final revelation that "alliances were not chains but spirals" offers resonant insight without moralizing. The recurring slide motif accumulates meaning effectively, reweighting prior material at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with poetic compression ("turbine-hum reverie") that maintains consistency. POV control is clean with no head-hopping. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("timewoven fabric") that slightly strains the established voice, but rhythmic control under pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations and strong opening/closing lines. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor issues include occasional elevated diction ("perpetually learning the language of knots") and some summary passages that could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The time-loop structure with driftwood art as temporal anchor offers fresh perspective on familiar material. The GPS failure as civilization collapse is efficiently original. The synthesis of environmental art, time travel, and community building feels organic and earned, avoiding template patterns.</comment>
