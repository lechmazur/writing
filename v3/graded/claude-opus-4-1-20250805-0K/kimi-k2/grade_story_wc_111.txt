I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through pattern, repetition, and symbolic accumulation rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira's characterization achieves depth through embodied details—"hands mapped with scars and chlorophyll stains"—and her marble ritual reveals values through action rather than declaration. The final choice to leave the split marble buried carries visible cost ("some deceptions, once mended, must stay in the earth"). Minor deduction for the queen's somewhat stock skepticism, though her transformation lands effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the wisteria's bloom and the queen's acceptance crystallize a new understanding with clear cost—the broken device, the buried marble as price. The accumulative structure coheres beautifully as each marble story builds toward the transformation. Slight dock for the abrupt ending mid-sentence, though it functions as deliberate ellipsis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The maze setting actively shapes choices ("paths shortening before them") and the dying wisteria becomes the crucible for transformation. Sensory work excels: "perfume so sweet it felt like a lie," "dew...like hesitant stars." The probability glyphs worldbuilding adds texture without overwhelming the intimate scale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation reads through accumulative density—each marble story increases pressure until the split marble triggers the wisteria's resurrection. The queen's device cracking mirrors the marble's fracture, making cost visible. The garden's response ("paths shortening") shows earned resolution through Lira's accumulated authority.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the marble/memory system and the garden-as-witness concept. "Nothing lasts, but everything remembers" crystallizes without preaching. The final image of the future vine "twisted into the shape of a woman cradling a child" offers resonant, non-literal answer to whether human intention matters.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled lyricism ("withering blooming: roses opening and roses dying in the same breath"). Dialogue carries subtext effectively—"I walk at the speed of remembering." The perceptual signature remains consistent, filtering everything through botanical awareness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "marbles...each sphere a memory of a vine she had once coaxed back from blight." Some minor repetition around "marble" and "polished" in middle sections. Strong rhythm variation and purposeful fragments enhance the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The marble-as-memory system offers fresh angle on garden magic trope. The specificity of "statistically indifferent to human intention" and probability glyphs creates original worldbuilding. The mended deception concept—truth requiring buried lies—adds philosophical complexity beyond typical restoration narratives.</comment>
