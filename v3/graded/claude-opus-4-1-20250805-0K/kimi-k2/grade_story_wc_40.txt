I'll evaluate this literary story according to the rigorous standards provided.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scholar's transformation from decoder to listener shows clear internal progression with embodied emotion ("Tears blurred the dawn light"). His choice to surrender rather than decode demonstrates earned character change with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("weathered innocence") that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure - the library "begins, very quietly, to grow again" after the scholar's surrender. The cost is legible through his tears and abandonment of decades of scholarly approach. The pattern of sound-as-growth pays off convincingly, though the magical realism elements slightly dilute causal clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library functions as living setting that constrains and enables choice - the crystal's sonic properties, the chandelier's sympathy, the hollow in the dictionary all drive specific actions. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("pale blade of light," "shawl of cobwebs"). The setting transforms causally with the plot, becoming a character itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (decoding vs. listening) deepens through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens. The scholar's surrender represents genuine renunciation with cost ("decades writing footnotes to footnotes"). Escalation through density increase works, though the magical transformation at the end slightly undermines earned pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between preservation and growth, silence and sound, decoding and listening. The final image of quiet growth offers a non-literal answer to questions about knowledge and meaning. The recurring crystal/sound motif constrains choice and charges the closure effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("the last breath of a dying language"). Perceptual signature is consistent - the scholar notices through sound and scholarly metaphor. Some elevated diction ("reticent," "conjugations") fits the character's lexicon. Minor register drift in places but maintains coherence under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied syntax and rhythm. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting in figurative language ("blade of light," "shawl of cobwebs") and occasional abstraction ("weathered innocence"). No significant loops or scaffolding, though some phrases border on purple prose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library-as-organism with sound-as-growth creates an original angle. The transformation of scholarly pursuit into listening practice offers genuine insight. The specific detail of the crystal's sonic properties and the hollow in the dictionary avoid generic treatment, though the magical library concept itself is somewhat familiar.</comment>
