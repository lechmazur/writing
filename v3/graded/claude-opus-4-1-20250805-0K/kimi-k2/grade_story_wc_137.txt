I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric with precision.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered memories and images toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara accepts her role as witness/carrier.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's skepticism-to-acceptance arc is earned through embodied discovery ("memories not her own fluttered against her ribs like trapped moths"). Her "courageously kind even in doubt" drives the choice to transcribe rather than discard. The recognition of her mother's death date creates genuine vulnerability, though some interior passages lean toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara transforms from skeptic seeking escape to active witness who promises return. The tile's patterns revealing her mother's death date provides concrete cost ("tears blurred the page"). Who/where/when anchored early, accumulative structure coheres through memory layers building to personal revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tower as "tuning fork aimed at the sky" and whales tracing "silver scars" create vivid atmosphere. The tile constrains choice through its activated memories. Setting actively participates through the tower's "unheard symphony" channeling whale song, though some descriptions prioritize beauty over function.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from academic doubt to confronting personal grief through others' memories. The tile's revelation of her mother's death date ("a night Mara had spent indoors, refusing to look at the sky") crystallizes cost. Escalation tracks through accumulating memories to personal reckoning, though middle sections could tighten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the migration as "both map and clock, marking the distance between remembering and being remembered." The final promise to return reweights the opening skepticism without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the tile's magic squares encoding human stories, avoiding direct thematic statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature in phrases like "memories not her own fluttered against her ribs like trapped moths." POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("migration was both map and clock") that slightly exceeds Mara's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong imagery ("whales traced silver scars across the moonlit water") with good rhythm variation. Information density high in key passages. However, abstract constructions appear ("sharp enough to cut through fear," "space for reflection") and some paraphrase loops around memory descriptions reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The magic square tile encoding others' memories offers fresh angle on memory/witness themes. Specific detail like "a sailor's promise to return etched into the same grid of numbers" grounds the concept. The intersection of astronomy fellowship doubt with mystical memory-keeping creates unexpected synthesis.</comment>
