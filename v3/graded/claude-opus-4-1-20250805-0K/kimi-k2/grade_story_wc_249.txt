<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict between borrowed and authentic memories creates genuine tension through embodied action (drumming, tasting salt/rosin), though some passages drift toward abstract emotional summary ("quiet rebellion flared like dawn frost"). The final choice to redistribute memories while keeping her own shows earned agency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Elara's redistribution of memories reweights the opening condition with felt cost ("aware she had honored every borrowed heartbeat"). The lagoon's transformation and garden's response provide concrete markers of change, though the exact mechanism of memory transfer remains somewhat opaque.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden functions as active setting that constrains and enables choices—resonant vines respond to drumming, the auric lagoon brightens with collective longing, the seashell pedestal becomes instrument. Sensory details effectively layer sound, touch, and sight to create an immersive synaesthetic environment that directly shapes Elara's actions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Elara's drumming intensifies from tentative tapping to full percussion performance, with the lagoon's brightening response raising stakes. The cost manifests in her acceptance of future treatments while maintaining "quiet rebellion," though the immediate dramatic tension could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between borrowed/authentic memory and individual/collective experience without explicit moralizing. The final image of "entangled memories drifted as auroral sorrow turned toward nascent dawn" resonantly answers the central question about identity preservation within medical intervention.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("syncopated, hollow, determined"). The perceptual signature remains consistent—Elara experiences the world through sound and rhythm—though occasional register drift into elevated abstraction ("the universe inhaling folded around her like a silver sheath") slightly weakens immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, but abstract phrasing occasionally obscures concrete action ("auric lagoon raised a small golden hand"). Some figurative density in peak beats without clear payoff, and periodic register elevation that doesn't fully align with POV lexicon.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of medical experimentation with synaesthetic garden-as-instrument offers fresh specificity, particularly in how drumming becomes both compulsion and healing method. The concept of redistributing borrowed memories through percussive resonance transforms familiar medical guinea pig territory into something distinctly original.</comment>
