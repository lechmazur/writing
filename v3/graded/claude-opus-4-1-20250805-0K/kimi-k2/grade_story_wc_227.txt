I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds meaning through pattern, repetition, and density rather than strict causal progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's internal contradiction between uncertainty and purpose drives concrete micro-choices (matching craters to memories, pressing charm to marble). The statue's animation and dissolution create earned transformation with visible cost—she becomes fuel for continuation. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("conjuring meaning from the edge of oblivion") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the statue dissolves into gold dust that fuels the engines, transforming from confessor to literal sustenance for the journey. The cost is visceral—isolation continues but with purpose. The accumulative structure coheres through the crater-memory mapping system. Slight deduction for delayed orientation (workshop's nature emerges gradually).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The acid sea and brass workshop create immediate, constraining pressure—ritual submersion, corroded statue, cracking mainspring all force specific actions. The workshop as living entity (groaning whale, gear-caged belly) merges setting with character. The gold flowing from veins and crystallizing lungs ground the fantastical in bodily cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: each crater reveals deeper loss (city's attack→mother's death→master's crystallization), building toward the statue's demand to "Continue." The workshop's deterioration (mainspring cracks, hull needs mending) creates time pressure. Cost manifests in the alchemist's eternal keeper role—meaning conjured demands endless service.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kintsugi as central metaphor brilliantly unifies physical mending with memory-quilting—"the breaks themselves become the map." The statue's transformation from confessor to fuel embodies the theme of meaning requiring sacrifice. The final image of the workshop as "golden scar across the acid sea" resonates without stating its moral about beauty in damage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice merges alchemical precision with lyric compression ("Between the breaths I held underwater"). The perceptual signature is consistent—filtering everything through repair and transformation. Slight repetition in structure ("The first crater...The second...") works as intentional patterning but occasionally feels mechanical.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong moments of compression ("my master's final lesson, spoken while his lungs crystallized into glass"). Some filter-verb accumulation ("I feel," "I stand," "I begin") in transitions between major beats reduces immediacy. The "uncertain alchemist apprenticed to silence" construction appears twice with slight variation, creating minor redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The acid sea workshop and kintsugi-based magic system create fresh world-logic. The statue as confessor-turned-fuel transforms a potential cliché. The specific synthesis of maritime imagery with alchemical transformation, plus the ritual breathing mechanic, creates memorable uniqueness. The "memories as fuel" concept elevates beyond typical repair narratives.</comment>
