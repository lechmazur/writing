I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through lyric density and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where paper birds drift over prison walls.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vagrant poet's monthly personality molting creates genuine internal tension, particularly when Lark resists the change to remain with Mira. The inscription of "Anchor" on Lark's wrist embodying this resistance is earned through their book-sorting connection. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("luminous fracture between despair and defiance") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative structure builds effectively toward the paper birds drifting over prison walls—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (the library will burn, separation is inevitable). The buried tin beneath the sapling creates Charged Poise with legible stakes. Deduction for the abrupt ending mid-sentence and some orientation blur around the prison library's exact relationship to the rusted library.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rusted library with its bullet-holed skylight and mildewed paper scent creates vivid atmosphere that constrains choices (books must be hidden in false panels, work happens by starlight). The coffee tin's false bottom and the sickly sapling both function as micro-settings that enable key actions and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from sorting books to building secret taxonomy to creating paper birds as "origami grenades." The impending library burning creates time pressure that forces action. The cost is legible—tomorrow's destruction makes tonight's beauty urgent—though the piece could sharpen the immediate consequences of discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between destruction and preservation, with the final image of paper birds as "luminous fractures" offering a non-literal answer to whether beauty can be forged from anarchy. The bus ticket poems as "seeds of blooming resistance" and books sorted by "revolt, tenderness, incandescence" avoid stating morals while building thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with phrases like "molts personalities monthly" and "voice soft as moth wings." The perceptual signature is distinct—noticing "hinges bleeding rust" and "moon sailing higher." Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("unclaimed footnotes of history") that slightly exceeds the vagrant poet's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("paper birds that caught the wind") but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most high-pressure beats without always advancing pressure. Some paraphrase loops ("luminous fracture" appears twice with similar meaning). The abrupt cutoff damages momentum, though the accumulative design partially compensates.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a personality-molting poet who plants resistance through hidden verses offers fresh specificity. The secret book taxonomy of "revolt, tenderness, incandescence" and paper birds as "origami grenades that carried only ink" transform familiar resistance tropes through particular detail.</comment>
