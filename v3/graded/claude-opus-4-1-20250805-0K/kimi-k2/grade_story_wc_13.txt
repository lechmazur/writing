<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to complete the bestiary drives concrete choices throughout, with embodied tension in the trembling pencil and the warm pendant against lips. The character makes consequential micro-choices (flicking borrowed future, speaking "uncage") that reveal her willingness to steal from the giant's time despite knowing the cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "infinity symbol" mechanics that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the captured echo transforms into portable knowledge, fundamentally changing Lira's relationship to the city. The cost is legible: she steals a second from the giant's sleep and witnesses potential futures including the empty city after the giant wakes. Orientation anchors (rooftop, canal, moonlight) establish immediately, and the magical system teaches its rules through action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system functions as both setting and constraint, forcing Lira to navigate specific paths and sculpt time to reach the echo foundry. Sensory details (copper gutter, moonlit water trickling, glass troughs like harp strings) create a vivid vertical cityscape. The setting actively shapes choices—the canal's fork, the spiral staircase of liquid light, the iron cage at the tower's crown all determine Lira's tactical approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from needing to draw echoes to actively stealing time from the sleeping giant, with the interrupted cadence creating urgency. The dominant stake (completing the bestiary before the giant wakes) tightens when Lira must choose to subtract time from the giant's nap. Cost manifests in the mirrors showing her future in an empty city and the weight of the captured birthplace.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The interrupted cadence functions as both literal musical concept and thematic question about completion versus suspension. The infinity symbol recurs meaningfully—pendant to drawing to expanded halo to final pulse—accumulating resonance without stating meaning. The ending's portable birthplace of echoes offers a non-literal answer about preserving fleeting moments through art.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters the world through an illustrator's eye ("glass troughs that arched between towers like harp strings"). Voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity, from measured observation to urgent action. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("resonant reconfiguration" implied in "portable in ink and paper") that slightly exceeds the established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("canal forked ahead, splitting into two glass troughs") and varied sentence structures. However, some figurative density in peak beats ("spiral staircase of liquid light," "glass bird with a throat full of unresolved questions") and occasional abstract phrasing around the time-sculpting mechanics create minor opacity. The paraphrase of stealing time appears twice in adjacent sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of musical theory (interrupted cadence) with urban fantasy (giant as foundation) creates a genuinely fresh premise. The specific solution of drawing time to capture echo-creatures transforms familiar elements through concrete worldbuilding. Risk-taking in the non-linear time mechanics and the metaphysical echo foundry heightens stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
