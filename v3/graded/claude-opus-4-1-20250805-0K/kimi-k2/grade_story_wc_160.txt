<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to balance the city's needs with the volcano's right to rest creates genuine internal conflict, embodied through trembling hands that shift from fear to certainty. The final choice to engage the lever carries visible cost—risking both eruption and valley starvation—with her engineering solution representing earned wisdom from her mentor's encrypted compassion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through sensory details and ritual actions toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where water flows through "channels carved with respect rather than conquest." The closure lands with felt cost as Lira finally smiles after her mentor's death, having achieved harmony between opposing needs through precise calibration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amphitheater and volcano function as active participants—breathing, groaning, exhaling—that constrain Lira's engineering choices and shape the final harmony. Spatial choreography remains coherent as she moves from stage to orchestra pit to hidden lever, with the setting's volcanic details (pumice motes, lava tubes, caldera rim) creating atmospheric pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from measuring infrastructure to decoding coordinates to risking catastrophic eruption versus valley starvation, with the lever engagement forcing a precise calibration between extremes. The tension peaks when "any floodgate opened too wide would fracture the caldera, yet any gate left closed would starve the valley," making Lira's millimeter-precise solution carry genuine cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete engineering challenge of harmonizing "conflicting values between the city's thirst for power and the volcano's right to rest." The final image of water and stone making "quieter music" while the volcano inhales "wet earth and new growth" offers a non-literal answer about balance through respect rather than conquest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV maintains consistent close third with selective perception focused on engineering details and volcanic atmosphere, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("motes of pumice that drifted like ash snow, dappling the air with resolve"). Voice strengthens when grounded in technical specificity like "calibrated the chain's slack to the millimeter."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong sensory integration ("each tarnished brass link clinking like a muted bell") but suffers from repetitive emotional labeling ("trembled" appears twice, "slyly heartfelt" feels forced) and occasional overwriting in figurative language. The paraphrase loop between lines 11-12 about the letter's warning creates redundancy that dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise of an engineer using surveyor's tools to balance a dormant volcano's hydrology offers fresh specificity, particularly the detail of "microscopic threads of gold leaf spelling coordinates in an archaic cipher." The synthesis of engineering precision with environmental respect creates a non-obvious resolution, though some metaphorical flourishes feel derivative.</comment>
