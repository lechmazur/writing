I'll evaluate this story systematically under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and memory transfer rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The keeper's transformation from isolated observer to active bearer of another's memories shows genuine interiority through embodied detail ("tastes salt and iron," "warm as a pulse"). The borrowed memory of the avalanche arrives with visceral specificity. Minor deduction for some filter-verb clustering in the middle third that slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the keeper accepts his role as guardian of both ships and memories, with clear cost ("isolation is no longer empty; it is witnessed"). The accumulative structure coheres through gaps/absences building to memory transfer. The promise to "hold your circle until the sea gives you back" crystallizes the transformation with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Nautical twilight's "bruised opal" merging sky and sea establishes atmosphere immediately. The Edelweiss carrying "high alpine air, sharp and clean, utterly alien to this salt world" creates sensory contrast that charges the memory transfer. Setting actively shapes the keeper's investigation through "negative spaces between pilings" and mist that "erases footprints before they finish forming."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating absences ("gaps where memory should be") to the visceral alpine memory ("a boy laughing on a sunlit ridge, before the snow gives way") that transforms understanding. The keeper's shift from passive observation to active memory-bearing shows clear cost. The final promise represents genuine stance crystallization under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transfer of grief and memory without exposition. The Edelweiss bridges two worlds (alpine/coastal) while the circle on the wrist becomes a binding mark. The ending reweights isolation from emptiness to "witnessed, populated by alpine sunlight" without stating meaning directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice maintains lyric control throughout ("lantern swinging like a slow heartbeat," "ocean itself is bleeding memory"). POV filters everything through the keeper's observational mindset. The prose rhythm appropriately slows during memory reception and accelerates during realization moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Some filter-verb clustering mid-story ("he feels," "he understands," "he realizes") and occasional redundancy ("softly persistent" appears twice verbatim). The final unfinished "lantern extinguished" creates purposeful incompletion that works structurally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of transferring memories through gaps/absences offers fresh treatment of grief and burden-sharing. The stranger walking "backward out of the tide" provides a striking reversal image. The lighthouse keeper as witness to borrowed memories transforms the isolation trope meaningfully.</comment>
