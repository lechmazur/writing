<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marisol's involuntary truthfulness creates genuine constraint that shapes her interactions and drives the discovery sequence. The transformation from routine toll-keeping to wonder-tending shows earned change through concrete discovery, though some internal realizations ("the careful tending of wonder") arrive without sufficient struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens coheres through density increase and pattern transformation—from mechanical bees to luminous ones, from electrical tower to wonder-generator. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as the tower's purpose shifts from power to poetry, with visible cost in the city's blackout-to-rebirth cycle. The riddle-to-realization sequence provides clear because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tower functions as active setting that constrains and enables choice—Marisol must climb it, place the box at its summit, and witness transformation from its base. Sensory detail ("burnt ozone," "nectar dusk," "copper veins") creates atmospheric coherence while the tower's physical transformation from failed infrastructure to luminous hive charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal routine through riddle-solving to city-wide transformation, with Marisol's agency driving each discovery beat. The cost manifests in the blackout's necessity for rebirth and the dissolution of her old role, though middle sections could tighten the pressure between finding and solving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The wonder/routine dichotomy emerges through concrete transformation rather than statement, with the riddle serving as pivot between mechanical and luminous states. The final image of bees "writing poems of light" resonantly answers the thematic question without moralizing, though "wonder, always wonder" edges toward explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice maintains lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("copper veins were silent," "nectar dusk deepened to violet"). POV remains stable with appropriate perceptual filtering through Marisol's toll-keeper lens, though some passages drift toward elevated diction that slightly exceeds her established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong imagistic density but suffers from repetitive structural patterns ("She [verb]ed" dominates multiple paragraphs) and occasional overwriting ("condensed lightning and memory"). Information density remains high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements, though some metaphorical reaches strain clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of infrastructure failure and wonder preservation offers fresh angle on transformation narrative, with specific details (toll-keeping truthfulness, lightning-harvesting bees) avoiding generic templates. The riddle mechanism and luminous bee transformation create non-obvious resolution that feels earned through accumulated particulars.</comment>
