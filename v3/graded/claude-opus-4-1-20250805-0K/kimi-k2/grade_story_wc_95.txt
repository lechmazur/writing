I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through layered symbolic actions, coded communications, and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysandra's mechanical arm and her transformation of questions into destinations through coded angles shows clear motivation rooted in her philosophical dueling tradition. The envoy's "diplomatically fierce" nature creates genuine tension through their formal combat-as-conversation. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract resolution where both characters' final motivations feel predetermined rather than discovered through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the final "depart together" message and shared understanding that "destinations are merely questions that have grown tired of asking." The accumulative structure coheres well through the needle-card cipher system and sundial angles. Deduction for cost being more conceptual than visceral - while the philosophical resolution lands, the personal stakes remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass atrium with its fractured light and half-painted sundial creates a vivid arena where setting directly enables the coded communication system. The danish tin needle card's numbered steel rectangles "glinting like miniature rapiers" perfectly bridges object and action. The brook's reflection projecting "swirling constellations onto their upheld palms" charges the final image beautifully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The philosophical duel escalates from circling to blade-work to joint understanding, with each parry corresponding to needle movements and recalibrated shadows. The stakes deepen as questions transform from abstract philosophy ("Is sovereignty a melody?") to personal revelation ("So the questions were never for me"). The cost remains primarily intellectual rather than visceral, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of questions-as-destinations emerges organically through the needle cipher, coded stones, and compressed musical overture. The final insight that "destinations are merely questions that have grown tired of asking" reweights all prior philosophical sparring. The half-painted sundial standing "incomplete yet sufficient" resonates as a perfect metaphor for provisional truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lysandra's voice carries distinctive texture through phrases like "brass knuckles clicking like distant typewriter keys" and "gears sang." The envoy's formal register ("precise as a treaty clause") contrasts effectively. Slight deduction for occasional overwriting ("dignified chaos," "diplomatically fierce") that pushes toward the ornate without full justification.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("gnomon cast a crooked shadow"). However, several instances of overwriting detract: "fractured through the vaulted ceiling, scattering dignified chaos" feels strained, as does "questions trailing behind like wedding veils." The metaphor density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies, particularly in philosophical passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of philosophical debate with physical dueling through a cipher system of sewing needles and sundial angles is genuinely inventive. The concept that questions can be "turned into destinations" through coded combat offers a fresh take on both mentor-student relationships and diplomatic negotiation. Risk-taking in the symbolic density pays off through coherent world-building.</comment>
