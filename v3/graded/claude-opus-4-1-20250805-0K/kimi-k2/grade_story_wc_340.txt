<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina's "warmly inquisitive" trait drives her key actions—catching the goggles "as if they were a wounded bird," seeking joy beneath anguish, and the final embrace. The captain's transformation from snarling to laughter shows earned change through concrete action, though some interior passages lean toward abstraction ("affectionate detachment").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer toward the rooftop revelation where the captain laughs "like engines restarting." The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration through the goggles' cracked-lens aurora—lands with emotional cost ("tears freezing into brief crystals"). The diary decryption provides causal linkage while the elevator's ascent creates natural pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire constrains movement to vertical ascent, with each floor marking tension. Sensory details like "gears singing like icicles tapped by wind" and "prism windows" create atmosphere while the cracked goggles become a lens for decryption, making setting functional rather than decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—returning joy to the captain before the fleet arrives—escalates through the elevator's rise and diary decryption. The ticking clock ("fleet arrived at dusk") and vertical progression create coherent pressure, though the captain's transformation happens somewhat quickly given the setup's weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the decoded diary lines ("Joy is the lift you feel when sorrow is ballast thrown overboard") and crystallizes in the final image of the spire as "lighthouse of reclaimed flight." The goggles' transformation from rebuke to instrument of vision provides non-literal resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "each floor a heartbeat" and selective perception through Lina's lens. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("affectionate detachment allowing her to witness") that slightly distances from immediacy, though the overall texture remains distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("ice crackling off cables," "shoulders hunched like folded wings") but occasional abstraction weakens momentum ("affectionate detachment" appears twice). Information density is generally high with purposeful imagery, though some metaphors stretch ("a mast in a gale of memory").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The encrypted diary revealed through prism light and cracked goggles offers a fresh angle on loss/recovery. The vertical journey structure with floor-by-floor revelation feels earned, though the emotional resolution arrives somewhat neatly for the complexity established.</comment>
