I'll evaluate this story systematically under the demanding standards for literary publication.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the piece builds through sensory layers and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara's scream transforms the lighthouse's function from warning to welcoming.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between inherited gentleness and suppressed fierce tenderness drives authentic character progression. The thirty-year scream's release feels earned through accumulated sensory memory. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient mass emotional transformation in the village.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - the lighthouse transforms from warning to welcoming through Mara's scream, with visible cost in her collapse and the captain's tears. The accumulative structure coheres well though the village-wide transformation strains credibility. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory layering - "rosemary for remembrance, lavender for the sleep she'd lost, and something darker—ozone and copper—that tasted like screaming tenderness." The lighthouse constrains choices and the scent-memory system drives the closure, though some metaphors edge toward overwrought.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure builds through sensory accumulation toward Mara's choice to release her suppressed scream. The escalation from whisper to scream meaningfully deepens the stake. However, the village-wide instant transformation lacks sufficient resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the whisper/shout paradox - "some tenderness has to scream to be heard at all." The scent-garden-truth motif accumulates meaning without stating morals. The final image of children dreaming of flying resonates without explaining.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature through scent-based noticing and synaesthetic descriptions. Voice maintains lyric consistency though occasionally drifts toward purple prose ("bruised sky," "screaming tenderness"). The POV holds steady throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("The beam exploded outward, carrying her voice on frequencies below human hearing"). Some register drift in peak moments. No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse-keeping with scent-memory and intention-purification creates an original angle. The concept of "screaming tenderness" offers genuine insight. Loses points for the somewhat template mass-awakening resolution.</comment>
