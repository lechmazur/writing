I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for publishability.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern, imagery, and cadence shifts rather than causal plot turns, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's motivation crystallizes through embodied action with the storm glass mirroring emotional states. The child's transformation from silence to smile shows earned change through concrete interaction. Minor deduction for some abstraction in "teach silence how to comfort" that isn't fully embodied until the final beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure with clear Resonant Reconfiguration - the child's transformation from burden to lightness. The storm glass's weather patterns create visual causality linking emotional states to closure. Cost is visible in "tears drying under starlight" and the child stepping off "lighter, suitcase no longer dragging."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prism terrace functions as active setting - tilting "as if bowing," creating refracted starlight halos that participate in the child's healing. The storm glass vial constrains and enables the central interaction. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, particularly the visual interplay of light and water.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation reads through density increase and pattern shifts in the storm glass - from snowflake to rain to luminous particles. The child's sigh catalyzes transformation with visible cost in tears. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length, though the stakes could press harder.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the storm glass's transformations and Lira's teaching that "silence isn't empty." The final image of the vial as "perfect sphere of still water" resonantly answers the central question about processing departure. No explicit moralizing; meaning accrues through image and gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled lyricism - "vaulting hush," "liquid rainbows." POV remains stable with Lira's perceptual signature clear in how she measures silence and reads emotional weather. Dialogue sparse but effective, particularly "Now the silence knows your name."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "vaulting hush." Some elevated diction ("catalyzed," "imperceptibly") occasionally strains but doesn't break voice. Information density high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gondola operator as grief counselor using weather-reading device. The storm glass as emotional barometer offers non-obvious angle on processing loss. Specific details like "train made of snow" traveling across glass avoid generic consolation templates.</comment>
