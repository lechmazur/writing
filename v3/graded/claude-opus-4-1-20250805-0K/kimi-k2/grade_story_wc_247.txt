I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and gesture toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "translate silence into music" after losing hearing is embodied through concrete gestures and internal contradictions (joy within sorrow). The final choice to submerge and then return inland shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("distilled joy") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, the story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the harbor's final "requiem that was also a lullaby" and his footprints that "would fade by dawn." Cost is felt through submersion and the vintage camera's "memory of applause." Orientation anchors (harbor, moonlight, deaf composer) land early and support the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The harbor setting constrains choices through water's physical presence (shoes filling, submersion to waist) and enables the sign language performance. Moonlight transforms water to "sheet of glass scored by his invisible staff." The vintage camera and bollard serve as micro-settings that shape gesture and ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through intensifying gestures: signing to tide → faster signing → stepping into water → submersion. The dominant stake (translating silence) deepens when "water rose, translating his body into a bass note." Cost manifests physically through cold water and emotionally through the "memory of applause."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of conducting silence, with the harbor becoming both audience and instrument. The final image of footprints that "would fade by dawn" offers a non-literal answer about impermanence and unrecognized art. "The city that had forgotten him but would one day hum his tune" avoids stating a moral while achieving resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature filters everything through musical metaphor ("timpani of memory," "dotted half notes"). Voice maintains lyric consistency though occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("liquid chord resolving"). The controlled absence of dialogue reinforces the silence theme.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("bubbles rising in dotted half notes") but suffers from abstract passages ("distilled joy," "reluctant soloist") and some template phrasing ("He signed," "He stepped," "He lifted"). Information density is high when concrete but diluted by philosophical abstractions that don't advance pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of a deaf composer conducting the harbor through invented sign language offers genuine freshness. The vintage camera without film as tuning fork shows inventive transformation of familiar elements. Some safety in the resolution (returning to shore rather than committing fully) prevents higher scoring.</comment>
