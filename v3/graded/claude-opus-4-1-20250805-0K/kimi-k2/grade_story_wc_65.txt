<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ignorance cartographer's motivation crystallizes through embodied details—the warm pulse of glass against her palm, the equations scratched into frost—though her internal contradictions could be sharper. The choice to create rather than correct earns its cost through the closed loop of sustainable energy, accepting forever-closed paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the partnership between cartographer and spire, with visible cost in the "spent nib" and transformed landscape. The accumulative/textural lens holds as frost equations build toward the final sustainable energy sigil, though the middle third could tighten causality between modeling and the spire's response.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The obsidian spire functions as both setting and constraint, its warm pulse and liquid threads directly shaping the cartographer's choices. Sensory hierarchy reflects her priorities—the kingfisher feather's iridescent barbs, frost crystal geometry—while the frozen lake's seasonal melt becomes integral to the sustainable energy solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal need ("create rather than correct") through the spire's partnership offer to accepting limited paths, with cost visible in the dulled quill nib. The constraint of "innovation must grow from limitation" meaningfully narrows options, though middle pressure could intensify between equation-drawing and the spire's response.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the kingfisher's perfect dive "only because water limited its flight," resonating with the cartographer's acceptance of constraint. The final image of icegrass following modeled melt patterns offers a non-literal answer about collaboration over conquest, though the "disciplined dreaming" phrase edges toward explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through selective attention to mathematical patterns in frost and the spire's volcanic memory. Voice modulates effectively from pre-dawn cold observation to exhausted satisfaction, though occasional elevated diction ("perilous," "ancient violence") slightly exceeds the POV's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"breath fogging in the pre-dawn cold that clung to the frozen lake like a secret." Some template cadence appears mid-story ("She understood then," "She realized," "She thought of") and "groundedly imaginative" reads as prompt-speak, though the closure image remains untouched by artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ignorance cartographer who charts blank spaces and erases false coastlines offers a fresh angle on mapmaking. The synthesis of predictive modeling with volcanic glass that remembers fire feels earned, though "innovation within constraint" echoes familiar creative writing wisdom without full transformation.</comment>
