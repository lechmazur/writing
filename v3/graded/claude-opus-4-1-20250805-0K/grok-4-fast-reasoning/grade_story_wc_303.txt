<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict between solitary beauty and empire service drives genuine tension through concrete embodied details (callused fingers hesitating, mulberry ache). The telepathic plant ability and provenance expertise create specific character texture. Deduction for some abstract phrasing ("propagate destinies," "perforated destiny") that edges toward conceptual rather than embodied in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara chooses the dream path with visible cost (forsaking empire archives). The ice violin's revelation through plant telepathy provides causal tightening. Minor deduction for slightly abstract cost articulation ("mended horizon," "purposefully porous") rather than more concrete imagery at the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The velvet observatory setting actively constrains choice through its midsummer heat pressing against the ice violin's impossible preservation. Plants function as setting elements that deliver crucial plot information. The sensory layering (crimson drapes, nightshade scent, cooling coffee) creates atmospheric pressure that charges the decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes clearly established early (dream vs empire) with meaningful deepening when the violin's true nature is revealed. The coffee stain visions provide concrete pressure imagery (crown splintered by thorns). Slight deduction for the resolution feeling somewhat predetermined once the plants reveal the violin's purpose rather than maintaining genuine tension through the final choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the perforated destiny metaphor becoming literal choice-points. The ice violin serves as both concrete object and thematic vessel for frozen possibilities. Minor deduction for occasional explicit thematic statements ("propagating a new lineage, not of thrones but of healed destinies") that venture toward thesis articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevated register fitting a provenance researcher's interiority. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity. Deduction for occasional register drift into overly abstract conceptual language ("propagate destinies," "porous destiny") that strains against the otherwise grounded sensory work.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong sensory specificity and varied sentence structures. However, several instances of abstract conceptual phrasing ("propagate destinies," "perforated path," "communal bloom") create opacity. Some synonym churning around destiny/fate/path concepts. The elevated register occasionally tips into purple prose territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ice violin defying summer heat creates an original tension, and the plant telepathy offers a fresh angle on magical realism. The provenance researcher role provides specific expertise. Deduction for somewhat familiar artist-versus-institution conflict and the tendency toward abstract conceptual resolution rather than grounded specificity.</comment>
