<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to nurture wonder through shared grief is clear and drives meaningful choices, particularly in gifting the curl. The emotional progression from guardedness to "dawning wonder" in Theo feels earned through concrete musical exchange. Interiority relies on some abstract phrasing ("ordinary magic," "cautious exuberance") but embodied moments like crushing sage leaves and synced breathing during eclipse ground the emotions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Theo's transformation from grief-muted to wonder-budding, with the curl transfer marking decisive change. Causality flows cleanly from Elena's therapeutic intent through shared eclipse experience to Theo's awakening. The cost—Elena giving away her precious keepsake—is visible on page, though the piece leans heavily on thematic repetition ("ordinary magic," "dreaming roots") that slightly dulls impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sage Ridge functions as more than backdrop—the sage roots mirror the theme of endurance through darkness, and crushing sage leaves provides sensory grounding during connection. The eclipse creates natural pressure through temporal constraint and cosmic alignment with their grief. Setting actively shapes the therapeutic encounter through isolation, natural quietude, and the ridge's elevation for viewing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—nurturing wonder in grief-struck Theo—is signaled early and tightens through the eclipse sequence. Elena's choice to give away her daughter's curl represents meaningful escalation with visible cost. However, Theo's resistance is minimal and his transformation happens smoothly without significant opposition or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of finding magic in ordinary endurance emerges through sage roots, eclipse shadows, and shared grief, though "ordinary magic" appears too explicitly five times. The curl as talisman and harmonica as connection tool work thematically. The ending image of Theo's quickening steps with "exuberance budding cautiously" resonates but the piece over-articulates its central metaphor rather than letting it emerge purely through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with nature-based imagery fitting Elena's gentle therapist perspective. Some passages achieve genuine poetry ("corona blazing in soft, otherworldly glow") while others feel overwrought ("the hush of dreaming roots now amplified"). POV stays cleanly with Elena throughout, though her professional therapeutic awareness occasionally intrudes on the emotional immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine lyricism but suffers from repetitive phrasing—"ordinary magic" appears 5 times, "dreaming roots" 4 times, "cautious/cautiously" forms 4 times. Sentence variety generally works though some constructions feel strained ("her movements softly adaptive to the boy's hesitant energy"). The piece maintains momentum despite the repetition, and the eclipse sequence flows well.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Using a solar eclipse as catalyst for grief processing offers a fresh angle, and the sage ridge setting with its enduring roots creates organic metaphor. The specific detail of gifting a dead child's hair curl to another grieving child is emotionally bold. However, the transformation follows predictable therapeutic arc and some elements feel workshopped rather than discovered.</comment>
