<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias shows clear internal contradiction between scientific method and emotional need, embodied through his cloud categorization system. His motivation is rooted in grief but drives meaningful choices. The final acceptance represents earned change with visible cost. Some moments edge toward therapy-speak ("spooled wholeness," "quietly explosive") but the core characterization holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds pressure through the ascending gondola and thinning air. The tether breaking creates clear inciting incident. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing - the realization that "voids weren't empty; they were archives" reweights the premise with felt emotional cost. The accumulative lens holds consistently through to the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sky gondola setting constrains all action and choices, creating the isolation necessary for his work. The brass telescope functions as micro-setting, handled multiple times and charging the final image. "Dusty starlight" creates consistent atmospheric texture. Environmental details like oxygen deprivation directly affect his consciousness and decision-making.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake clearly established - proving empty spaces remember Lena. Escalation builds through altitude, oxygen deprivation, and mounting "quietly explosive" pressure. Agency shown through his choice to memorialize and accept loss. The tightening is meaningful and the cost is visible in his transformation from desperate seeking to acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic coherence around memory, loss, and the persistence of wholeness in fragments. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about voids as archives without explicit moralizing. "Spooled wholeness" integrates organically with the meteorological frame. The brass telescope and cloud categorization carry effective subtext about scientific method transformed by grief.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature blending scientific observation and grief. The elevated, lyrical diction fits the atmospheric accumulative structure. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional intensity. Some moments of overwrought phrasing but voice remains coherent and character-specific throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Generally strong rhythmic control and atmospheric density. However, repetitive phrasing appears ("dusty starlight," "spooled wholeness," "quietly explosive") and some metaphorical density borders on overwrought. Information density is good but occasional clarity issues arise. The accumulative structure justifies some repetition, but execution could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of meteorology and grief through cloud categorization by emotion. The sky gondola setting creates unique constraints. "Spooled wholeness" offers an original conceptual framework. However, the basic premise of widow seeking closure through obsessive scientific pursuit feels somewhat familiar despite the specific meteorological angle.</comment>
