<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's purposeful curiosity drives meaningful choices through scarred wisdom and visionary purpose, with her decision to link through scars representing genuine cost. The tree-consciousness maintains consistent interiority through embodied sensations like "sap in her veins" and "roots straining but holding firm." Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "anxious elation" that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure as the eclipsed covenant "shone anew" after Elara bridges temporal scars. The cost is visible through her "wilted but fulfilled" maze clipping and the permanent alteration of her scarred patterns. Orientation anchors (cobalt glade, dusk, tree-being) establish by ~100 words, and the pattern of linking/convergence builds density toward the charged final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt glade functions as constraining micro-setting through Elara's root-bound nature, with scars that "pulsed now, alive with the echo of dreams." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered through tree-perception ("whispers," "urgent rustle," "shimmer"). The setting actively shapes her method of reaching the rift through extended branches while roots hold firm, making environment integral to action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on mending the eclipsed covenant with clear escalation from passive vision to active intervention using the maze clipping. The tightening occurs when "anxious elation flooding her core" as she links through scars, with visible cost in the wilted clipping. Agency manifests through Elara's choice to bridge scars despite being root-bound, though the resolution could show more immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the intersection of individual and collective dreams without explicit moralizing, particularly in "a child's hope for endless play merging with an elder's wish for enduring peace." The final image of "convergence" rather than chaos reweights the opening's temporal disruption. The maze motif effectively represents branching possibilities that must be navigated through scars/memory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive tree-consciousness voice with selective perception ("whispers of what might be," "branches reaching not just for sunlight"). Psychic distance remains controlled through embodied tree-sensations and consistent focalization. Minor repetition of "anxious elation" phrase, but overall maintains unique perceptual signature through arboreal metaphors integrated with action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between description and action. Some repetitive phrasing around "anxious elation" and "purposeful curiosity" creates minor loops. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story functions, though occasional abstract phrases like "intersection of dreams" could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The root-bound visionary tree concept offers fresh perspective on prophecy and temporal healing, with scars as conduits for memory/repair being particularly original. The synthesis of botanical and temporal elements feels organic rather than forced. Risk-taking through non-human consciousness and abstract concepts of dream-intersection pays off with coherent world-logic.</comment>
