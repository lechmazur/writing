<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation crystallizes through the discovery of the timer mechanism and his drive to harvest echoes for healing. His reflective nature and locksmith precision create consistent character logic, though some interiority edges toward abstract philosophizing ("the cellar of reason"). The final understanding of his own reflection as the harvest shows earned change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias's methodical reverse-engineering building toward the breakthrough moment when "the timer whirred faintly." The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as he realizes "the harvest was his own reflection, echoed back" with the cost of his family's loss made explicit. Orientation anchors (locksmith, cavern, post-war refuge) establish clearly by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The marble cavern functions as active setting—its "veins of quartz," "polished walls," and acoustic properties directly enable the echo-harvesting mechanism. Specific details like "low-angled wall" positioning and how "higher reflections softened the echoes into murmurs" make the environment essential to the story's resolution. The cavern's final sigh of approval charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing wonder to heal war's wounds—deepens through Elias's systematic attempts at different times and angles. The breakthrough when "the timer whirred faintly" represents meaningful escalation under the accumulative lens. Cost becomes legible through "his own echoes of loss—the war's toll on his family" though the middle section could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of harvesting echoes as preserving wonder against trauma. The final realization that "the harvest was his own reflection" offers a non-literal answer about processing loss through methodical work. Some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement ("storing wonder in the cellar of reason") but the ending image redeems this.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, though occasional elevated diction ("veins of quartz pulsed like forgotten heartbeats") slightly strains the locksmith POV. Perceptual signature shows in Elias's "peripherally focused" attention to edges and angles. Some filter-heavy passages ("Elias noticed how") reduce immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong opening establishes voice and atmosphere, but middle sections contain repetitive phrasing around "peripherally" and "harvest." Template cadence appears in the sequence "Elias began... Elias adjusted... Elias stored" though variety improves toward closure. Information density is generally high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a locksmith harvesting cavern echoes to preserve wonder offers a fresh synthesis of craft and magic. The specific detail of using reflection angles at different times to capture varying echo qualities shows originality. The piece commits to its premise though some metaphorical language ("cellar of reason") edges toward abstraction.</comment>
