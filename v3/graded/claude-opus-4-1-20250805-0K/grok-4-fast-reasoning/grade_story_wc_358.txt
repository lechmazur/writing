I'll evaluate this story under a **Causal drive lens** - the narrative follows clear because/therefore linkages as Elias investigates the crash, discovers wind patterns, and develops preventive insights.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent - cultivating foresight through forensic analysis. His methodical investigation and adaptation to discoveries show embodied expertise. The flight engineer's patch provides a concrete emotional anchor. Loses points for some diagnostic interiority ("his mind a whirlwind of calculations") and lack of internal contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: crash investigation → wind pattern discovery → understanding of convergence factors → preventive recommendations. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias walking out with "foresight taking root," though the cost is primarily retrospective (the crash itself) rather than a present sacrifice. The orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth of containers functions as both setting and causal agent - creating deadly wind tunnels that downed the plane. Vivid sensory detail ("rusted flanks etched with salt") and precise spatial choreography. The environment actively constrains Elias's investigation methods and shapes his final understanding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of preventing future tragedies escalates through discovery of the "singular convergence" - the precise intersection of wind tunnels, low-altitude run, and microburst. The investigation tightens from general survey to specific understanding. Cost is felt through the patch and silence but lacks present-tense sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of extracting foresight from disaster emerges through concrete investigation rather than assertion. The patch serves as a recurring motif connecting human cost to technical analysis. Final image of "foresight taking root amid the towering silence" resonates without moralizing, though could push harder against the safety of pure prevention.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent technical register matches Elias's expertise ("anemometer," "telemetry," "microburst"). Perceptual signature strong - he notices wind patterns, structural damage, technical details others would miss. Some filter-verb clustering ("Elias felt," "he spotted") prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density high in technical passages. Deducting for repetitive constructions ("Elias + verb" pattern appears frequently) and some overwriting in atmospheric descriptions ("forgotten monoliths under a shrouded sky").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The accident investigation framework provides solid grounding for exploring causality and prevention. The specific confluence of wind tunnels through shipping containers offers fresh detail. However, the investigator-learning-lessons arc follows familiar patterns without surprising transformation.</comment>
