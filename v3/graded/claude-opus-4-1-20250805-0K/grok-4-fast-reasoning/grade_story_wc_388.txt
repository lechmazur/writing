<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a conspiracy debunker is clear and drives her choices throughout. Her methodical investigation and final decision to wield the truth despite its cost feels earned. However, internal contradiction could be stronger, and some overwrought prose ("excavate truth," forensic mosaic metaphor) reduces the embodied quality of her experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The causal structure is solid—investigation leads to discovery leads to knowledge that changes her path forward. Closure achieves Decisive Change with visible cost (truth that will "shatter lies"). However, the ending is severely damaged by drafting artifacts ("But wait, that's over—adjusting," word count commentary) that muddle what should be a clean revelation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid post-apocalyptic setting with specific, purposeful details: radioactive dust storms, glowing apples, hazmat suit protection. The orchard functions as both mystery and environment that constrains choice. The scanner warnings, entrenching tool, and the buried device all constrain actions and charge the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear dominant stake (uncovering truth) with meaningful tightening as she discovers and reassembles the letters. Protagonist agency drives each escalation through her analytical choices. The cost is legible—she now bears knowledge that could destroy survivors' fragile hope, creating genuine moral weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the flawed diamond metaphor and truth vs. comfortable lies conflict. The ending offers resonant reconfiguration without explicit moralizing. Slight deduction for moments that edge toward direct statement ("comfortable lies that kept survivors numb") rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Generally consistent third-person limited with analytical voice matching character. Strong perceptual signature in her observational approach. However, register issues ("excavate truth") and especially the meta-commentary artifacts in the final section ("No, recount—actually") break POV consistency and damage voice control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Significant text artifacts severely damage the prose: "But wait, that's over—adjusting," "[600-800 achieved in core...]" and similar drafting commentary. Beyond artifacts, density issues create opacity ("forensic mosaic," overwrought constructions). Information moves the story forward but clarity suffers under the weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Solid synthesis of post-apocalyptic elements with conspiracy investigation. The "cursed diamond" revealing as technology provides a satisfying twist, and AgriCorp's Project Stillpoint adds specific world-building. While the investigator-uncovers-truth structure is familiar, the execution through specific environmental and corporate details elevates it above template level.</comment>
