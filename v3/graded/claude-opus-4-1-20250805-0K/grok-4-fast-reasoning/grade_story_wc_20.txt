<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elarion's guilt and alchemical expertise create clear motivation for his kintsugi ritual, with concrete embodiment through trembling hands and luminous regret. The internal conflict between his failure and redemptive drive operates in scene through the crucible mending. However, Lirra remains absent without dramatized relationship dynamics, and some passages drift toward abstract reflection rather than embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elarion's transformation of regret into "luminous acceptance" via the kintsugi ritual, with visible cost in his tears and trembling. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through alchemical imagery toward the final reweighting. Orientation anchors clearly (foundry, post-search, Elarion alone), though the closure's "ready to seek her anew" feels slightly soft without specifying how his transformed stance changes his search tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The foundry setting actively constrains and enables the alchemical ritual through wet iron scent, cooling forges, and available materials like rainwater and aurum powder. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("rain ceased its relentless drumming," "vapors that swirled like captured starlight"). The crucible and zodiac coin function as micro-settings that charge the final transformation, though some descriptive passages could integrate more tightly with action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—redeeming Elarion's failure through understanding names' weight—deepens through the kintsugi process as he moves from "negligence" to "luminous acceptance." The ritual's threatened imbalance ("heat threatened dissolution") creates pressure requiring precise counterweights. Cost is visible in tears mingling with steam and the shared weight of the reformed vessel, though escalation could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kintsugi metaphor brilliantly merges with theme as broken things become "factually stronger at breaks, mystically resonant." The understanding that "names weigh because they remember" emerges from concrete ritual action rather than assertion. The final image of Elarion stepping out with the mended vessel offers a non-literal answer to redemption through transformation rather than erasure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevation appropriate to an alchemist's precision ("calibrating elixirs between chaos and order"). The prose modulates effectively during the ritual sequence, tightening during technical moments and expanding for emotional beats. Perceptual signature is strong through alchemical terminology and mystical-factual balance, though some passages lean toward overwrought metaphor ("will-o'-the-wisps," "half-forged incantation").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, and the alchemical process maintains clear sequential logic. However, significant overwriting appears: "luminous regret suffused the chamber" and similar elevated diction clusters densely without pattern-teaching payoff (-0.5). Template cadence appears in "He would... He ground... He inscribed" sequence (-0.4). The prose achieves moments of clarity but struggles with consistent purple patches.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The kintsugi-alchemy fusion offers genuine freshness, transforming both concepts through specific integration. The "factually mystical" zodiac coin and the insight about names' weight show non-obvious synthesis. However, the absent apprentice trope and redemption-through-craft arc follow familiar patterns without sufficient transformation through lived detail.</comment>
