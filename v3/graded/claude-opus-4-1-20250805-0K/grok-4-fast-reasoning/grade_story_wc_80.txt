<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to become "archeologist of abandoned dreams" drives concrete action through finding the inkwell and embedding notes in repairs. His stoically sensitive nature creates internal contradiction shown through physical work masking emotional response. The transformation from surveyor to something more lands with earned weight, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("interlaced absences") rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through layered imagery of erosion, abandonment, and preservation, culminating in Elias embedding dream-notes in the foundation—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. Who/where/when anchored early (surveyor, coastal town, after drawbridge rises). The closure transforms him from recorder to active preserver, though the meta-commentary at the end ("Actually, final: Elias returned to shore...") disrupts the otherwise clean landing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—Elias can only access it when the drawbridge rises, must wade through cold water, work in difficult conditions. Sensory detail ("cold brine soaking his trousers," "bioluminescent algae") grounds the physical reality. The pavilion's decay mirrors and enables the thematic work, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("tilted like weary sentinels").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving abandoned dreams—deepens when Elias discovers the inkwell and chooses to embed stories in the repairs rather than just complete his surveying task. This represents meaningful agency with visible cost (labor, empathy's weight). However, escalation remains gentle rather than pressurized; the conflict is primarily internal without strong opposing force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete action of preserving dreams within physical repairs—not stated but enacted. The inkwell as abandoned object mirrors the pavilion's history, creating resonant layers. The ending image of Elias as "archeologist of abandoned dreams now awakened" reweights his initial surveying role, though the phrase "interlaced absences" occasionally abstracts what should remain concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV control generally steady with consistent psychic distance and appropriate access to Elias's interiority. Voice modulates between technical precision ("mapping every contour") and lyrical observation ("hushed blaze under moonlit ripples"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated literary diction that doesn't fully align with a surveyor's perceptual signature, and the meta-commentary breaks voice entirely.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Several strong images ("boots sinking into damp sand," "bioluminescent algae") demonstrate capable prose. However, abstract phrases like "interlaced absences" appear repeatedly without earning their weight through concrete dramatization. The meta-commentary about word count and revision ("642—no, recalibrate") severely disrupts momentum. Template phrasing emerges in emotional beats ("stoically sensitive," "quiet fire of his inner world").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The concept of a surveyor becoming preserver of abandoned dreams offers a fresh angle, and the specific detail of embedding notes in foundation repairs shows originality. However, some elements feel workshopped—"interlaced absences" reads as writing-prompt language rather than organic discovery. The meta-ending particularly undermines authenticity of vision.</comment>
