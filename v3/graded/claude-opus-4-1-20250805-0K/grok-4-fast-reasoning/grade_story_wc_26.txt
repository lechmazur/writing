<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve hope is clear and rooted in personal loss ("her own faded into silence"), with embodied emotion in tears and the river stone as tactile anchor. The choice to help the shadow shows values hierarchy with visible cost. However, internal conflict remains mostly told rather than simultaneously enacted, and the "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" trait feels more labeled than dramatized through specific perceptual choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the piece builds density through library imagery and shadow work, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where hope transforms from fragment to bloom with "luminous regret" as felt cost. Causality tracks cleanly from observation to intervention to preservation. The closure lands with visible transformation ("shadow settled into a new bloom") though the "momentary victory" undercuts permanence slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating library setting actively constrains and enables action—the stratosphere location isolates the work, the blooming shelves provide the preservation medium, and the cloud-pages create atmospheric pressure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("petals of forgotten lore drifting on currents"). The river stone functions as micro-setting that grounds Elara in physicality against the ethereal realm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving hope's shape) is signaled early and tightens through the shadow's approach to dissolution ("unraveling in the library's perpetual bloom"). The holoprojector method creates agency through deliberate intervention. However, the conflict lacks immediate opposition—the shadow poses no resistance, making this more contemplative accumulation than active struggle despite the emotional cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete comparison of hope's evolution from "unity" to "commodified viral echoes," avoiding direct moralizing. The river stone and shadow-bloom create a resonant dialectic between permanence and transformation. The final "momentary victory" acknowledges complexity without false resolution, and "luminous regret" captures the bittersweet cost of preservation work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the contemplative tone, with controlled rhythm in longer sentences that mirror Elara's deliberate movements. However, diction occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("penumbra," "inexorably") without clear POV justification. The perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness—any melancholic archivist could narrate similarly. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("clouds billowed like pages turned by an invisible wind") but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching payoff. Some metaphor mixing ("shadows stretched like fingers" vs "shadow unbound...like smoke"). Template cadence appears in "She had seen...," "She paused now...," "Elara's sharp eyes..." progression. Information density is moderate but could be higher.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise of shareable dreams creating a floating library of archived hopes offers fresh synthesis. The shadow as "fragment of collective hope" transforms the abstraction into concrete dramatic material. However, the execution relies on familiar melancholic-archivist tropes, and the preservation-through-video-comparison method feels somewhat arbitrary rather than inevitably arising from the world's logic.</comment>
