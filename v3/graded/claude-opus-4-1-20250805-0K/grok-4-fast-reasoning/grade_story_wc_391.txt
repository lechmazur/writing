<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's progression from observer to leader of patient revolutionaries shows consistent motivation, though her internal contradictions could be more embodied in scene. The transformation of Thorne from "whirlwind of fury" to patient moon-mapper demonstrates earned character change through concrete action. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("restrained wildness") that could be more specifically embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the viaduct crossing that "unyokes" mental chains, with the frozen lake's crack heralding change. Causal lens holds: Elara's moon-mapping method transforms impatient rebels into patient revolutionaries who then cross the magnetic threshold. Cost is visible in Thorne's struggle and the "slow grind of time and will" required for this patient revolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary's "jagged black columns" and frozen lake create a stark, memorable setting that shapes the story's patience-teaching method. The magnetic viaduct functions as both physical and symbolic threshold, its post-rain intensification adding sensory specificity. The final image of the cracking lake effectively charges the closure with environmental resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming impatience into revolutionary patience—escalates through Thorne's resistance, acceptance, and eventual crossing of the viaduct. The magnetic pull creates literal and figurative tension at the climactic threshold. Escalation could be stronger with more visible opposition from the Overlords rather than keeping them abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the moon-mapping practice that teaches "unhurried grace" as revolutionary method. The magnetic viaduct's "wild force restrained by stone's unyielding form" embodies the central paradox without stating it. The closing image of the cracking lake resonantly answers the thematic question about patience versus urgency.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the epic tone, with effective rhythm variation between contemplative passages and action. Some filter-verb clustering ("Elara watched them change") and occasional over-writing ("crystalline silence") slightly dull immediacy. POV control remains stable throughout with clear focalization through Elara.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("silver thread weaving through the stars") but suffers from occasional purple patches and abstract phrasing. Template cadence appears in middle sections ("One by one, they..." "Days blurred into weeks..."). The opening and closing sentences effectively bookend with strong imagery, though some middle passages lose propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of revolution through patience-teaching via moon-mapping offers a fresh angle on rebellion narrative. The magnetic viaduct as threshold between states is inventive and well-integrated. The story commits to its premise without retreating into conventional action, though some elements (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake) feel slightly generic.</comment>
