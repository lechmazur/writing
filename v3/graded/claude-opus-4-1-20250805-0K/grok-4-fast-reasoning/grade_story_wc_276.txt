<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in childhood trauma, driving his pursuit of the goddess's echo with "cool-headed" determination that holds under pressure. The internal journey from fractured grief to mended peace lands with earned cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "transliterating grief" that edges toward therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a clear Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias catching the divine echo and mending his fractures, with visible cost in the "weight of eternity" he must bear. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sonic patterns break and reform, building to the final harmonious stillness. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden functions as both setting and active participant, with waves "undulating in response" and transliterating emotions into visible script. The environment directly constrains Elias's fishing method through silence-vines and dissonant blooms. The sensory layering of sound-as-landscape creates a vivid, purpose-driven world that charges the final image of "waves lapping gently."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—catching the goddess's echo to heal internal fractures—escalates through the zigzag intensification and the echo's "savage" resistance pulling back "with the weight of eternity." Agency drives the resolution through Elias's deliberate breathing technique. The cost lands in bearing divine weight, though the tightening could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of broken patterns requiring divine silence to mend, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of Elias cradling his prize under "watchful, wandering stars" resonantly answers whether wild fractures can be healed. The "feral lullaby" paradox—savage yet soothing—embodies thematic complexity without false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent lyric-mythic register with controlled rhythm, particularly strong in "echoes bloomed like thorny vines" and pattern-taught compression. Some register elevation ("transliterating," "incarnate") occasionally strains against immediacy. The perceptual signature of sound-as-physical-substance remains distinctive throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, particularly in the sensory-rich opening. Some abstract phrasing ("divine remnant whispered in legends," "articulation of the voids between notes") creates mild opacity. The figurative language generally coheres, though "sleepwalking constellations" bleeding "like ink in water" mixes vehicles slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of fishing for divine sound in a synesthetic garden where emotions become visible script offers genuine freshness. The specific method of "voicing silence" to catch an echo transforms the familiar quest narrative. Risk-taking in the lyric-mythic mode heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>
