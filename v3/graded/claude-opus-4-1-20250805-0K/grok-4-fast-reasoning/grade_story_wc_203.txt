I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as the piece builds through layered discoveries and dust patterns toward a resonant revelation about the ghosts' burden.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's gift for seeing ghosts and analyzing patterns drives meaningful choices, particularly when he decides to engage with the mainspring barrel and interpret the dust patterns. However, the meta-commentary disruptions ("Wait, that's over—adjusting for count") and revision notes embedded in the text severely undermine character immersion. The motivation to discover what ceilings hide manifests concretely through his investigative actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The story fatally breaks its own narrative frame with explicit word-count adjustments and revision notes ("No, recount properly. Actually, the ledgers showed embezzlement"). These meta-interruptions destroy causality and prevent any coherent closure from landing. The piece literally revises its own ending multiple times on the page, making it impossible to identify a decisive change with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival setting with its "faded big top" and dust patterns creates atmospheric pressure that enables Elias's discovery. The dust accumulation patterns function as micro-setting, revealing the hidden panel and constraining his investigation method. The circus atmosphere effectively haunts the space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Stakes emerge through the ghosts' need for resolution and Elias's drive to uncover hidden truths, but the multiple ending revisions prevent any escalation from cohering. The piece cannot maintain pressure when it keeps restarting its own climax with different revelations (fire, then embezzlement).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The theme of hidden burdens and facades containing secrets emerges through the ceiling imagery and dust patterns. However, the meta-commentary about word counts and the multiple revised endings prevent any thematic resonance from accumulating. The concept of "weightless burden" appears but lacks consistent development.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice initially establishes a noir-tinged technical perspective appropriate to Elias's profession. However, the intrusive authorial commentary about word counts and revision decisions completely breaks POV control. The shift between story and meta-commentary creates jarring distance violations.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The embedded revision notes and word-count commentary constitute severe text artifacts that destroy narrative momentum. Lines like "Wait, that's over—adjusting for count" and "Final count adjustment" are generation artifacts that should never appear in finished prose. Some individual sentences show competent craft, but the meta-interruptions pervade the crucial final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The concept of an elevator technician who sees ghosts investigating an abandoned carnival offers fresh potential. The dust analysis method provides an original investigative approach. However, the execution's meta-commentary and multiple ending attempts undermine any innovative elements.</comment>
