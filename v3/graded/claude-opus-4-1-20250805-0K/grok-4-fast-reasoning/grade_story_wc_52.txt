<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's grief-processing through crystallized memory fragments shows genuine internal contradiction between holding on and letting go. The widow's "hauntingly practical" approach to loss—harvesting lessons before they scatter—creates embodied tension through the carving blank she grips while memories fracture. Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("hollow in her chest") rather than pure embodiment, but the final choice to carve peace into wood demonstrates earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with crystallized time fragments building toward Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara moves from passive grief to active creation through harvested memories. The kettle's boiling provides temporal constraint while memory crystals accumulate meaning, culminating in her beginning to carve. Cost is visible in the "fractured" memories and Marcus's death, though the final carving action could show more immediate price. Who/where/when anchored early; single-scene structure holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft above old circus grounds creates atmospheric pressure through rust-hued light and pattering rain that mirrors emotional states. Sensory detail filters through Elara's widowed perspective—the kettle's whistle, steam curling "like ghosts," ash wood's smooth grain. The setting constrains choice through isolation and memory-triggers, though some descriptions lean decorative ("fleeting prism"). The loft's transformation from wedding venue to widow's sanctuary charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake of processing grief through memory-harvesting deepens via crystallized time fragments, each revealing lessons about control, love, and courage. The kettle's escalating whistle creates urgency while memories fracture between "here" and "gone." Agency manifests through Elara's choice to contain chaos via carving rather than drowning in grief. Missing stronger mid-story tightening that would foreclose options; the progression feels more accumulative than pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through Marcus's lesson—"Loss is the price of living fully; harvest it, or it harvests you"—dramatized via Elara's crystallized memory method and final carving act. The intertwined man-and-lion sculpture she envisions captures the dance of trust and peril without stating morals. Subtext operates through the ash wood's properties (burns slow, endures flames) mirroring Elara's grief-processing. Final image of carving "peace into wood one stroke at a time" offers resonant answer to loss without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains consistent psychic distance with selective perception filtered through widow's grief—noticing wood grain, steam patterns, rust-hued light. Voice modulates between present-scene description and crystallized memory fragments with clear transitions. Some filter-verb clustering ("she saw," "she recalled") dulls immediacy in memory sections. Diction stays within Elara's plausible lexicon as a circus-adjacent widow, though lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond grief-focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of lyric precision ("each bead a fleeting prism catching the dying light") but suffers from repetitive structures and some overwriting. Template cadence appears in memory crystals ("Here he was... But gone in an instant"). Information density varies—strong in sensory moments, weaker in abstract grief descriptions ("hollow in her chest"). Several filter-verb stacks in memory sequences reduce immediacy. Opening and closing lines anchor effectively with kettle/carving frame.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystallized time method for processing grief offers fresh angle on widow's mourning—memories as sharp eternal shards rather than flowing narrative. Specific circus-world details (lion tamer, sawdust, big top) ground the universal loss theme. The ash wood carving as grief-container provides concrete originality. However, some grief expressions lean generic ("hollow in her chest," "scattered seeds of wisdom"), and the metaphor system occasionally strains (memories as both crystals and seeds).</comment>
