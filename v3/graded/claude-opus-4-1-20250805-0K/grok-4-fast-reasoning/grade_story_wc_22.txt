I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, inferring an Accumulative/Textural drive lens based on its lyric density and pattern of imagery building toward the final sprouting.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to transform battlefield into garden is well-rooted, with his specific ability to speak dead languages enabling the bird-call translation that drives action. The internal complexity of redemption-through-cultivation works, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("narrowing the vast sea into a sliver of endless ink") rather than embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with the first sprouts piercing wood and the harmony resurfacing, showing visible transformation with clear cost (the reef's death, battlefield scars). The accumulative lens holds as density builds through seed-scattering to sprouting, though the piece could anchor "who" more clearly in the opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The blooming jetty functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables Elias's fertilization work, with flowers erupting from splintered wood creating the specific conditions for renewal. Sensory detail effectively narrows from vast sea to intimate cracks, and the environment directly shapes the final sprouting image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal mission to ecological restoration as Elias translates bird calls and follows their guidance to the battlefield's deepest wounds. The fertilization action carries clear agency with visible cost (the reef's poisoning, war's destruction), though the immediate opposition could be more tangible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete action of sowing redemption where "cannon fire had scarred the earth and blood had salted the soil." The submerged concord concept effectively links past harmony to present restoration without explicit moralizing, and the ending's sprouting offers a non-literal answer to healing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric elevation with controlled rhythm ("fractured coastal road," "wheels crunching over shells"), though some passages edge toward purple prose. The perceptual signature of translating bird calls through dead languages is distinctive, and focalization remains stable throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but occasional overwriting appears ("blooming jetty" as both setting descriptor and thematic vehicle feels strained). Some template cadence emerges in the middle ("He knelt... He recalled... He worked...") though the closing rhythm recovers well.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of ecological restoration through ancient linguistic knowledge offers a non-obvious angle on renewal narratives. The specific detail of dead languages enabling bird-call translation to guide fertilization is genuinely inventive, though the battlefield-to-garden transformation itself is somewhat familiar.</comment>
