<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The wanderer's motivation to discover "the texture of memories" drives concrete micro-choices throughout—crouching behind containers, climbing precarious perches, clutching the poison label. Their internal state shifts from anonymous survivor to active collector, with the final image showing them as "survivor of ink's mistakes" accepting their nameless existence through borrowed histories.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught layering of overheard stories building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the wanderer's "death certificate error, once a void, now textured with these borrowed histories." The cost is legible—accepting permanent erasure while persisting through others' fragments. Orientation anchors (port, containers, tides) establish by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth of shipping containers functions as both physical maze and metaphor, with tides forcing retreats and exposing hidden alcoves that shape the wanderer's collecting pattern. Sensory detail filters through their altered perception—"ghosts of erased histories clinging to the surfaces"—while the poison label becomes a tangible anchor with "chemical warnings evoking the bitter tang of forgotten lives."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on discovering memory's texture through collected fragments, with tides providing natural escalation—forcing retreats, exposing secrets, creating urgency. The wanderer's agency manifests through deliberate positioning and listening choices, though the accumulative structure relies more on density increase than reversals, appropriate for this lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through layered erasures—the wanderer's bureaucratic death, the migrant turned cargo manifest, the captain's fabricated legend—all exploring how identity persists despite official obliteration. The final image of "collector of whispers, survivor of ink's mistakes" offers a non-literal answer about existence beyond documentation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout—"filtered reality differently, seeing not just metal and salt but the ghosts of erased histories." Voice modulates from lyrical ("monoliths in the port city's haze") to visceral during eavesdropping scenes, though some elevated diction ("intangible from the whispers") occasionally strains against the wanderer's anonymous status.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths matching tide patterns, though occasional overwriting appears ("treacherous streams," "indifferent embrace"). Information density high—most lines advance atmosphere, character state, and accumulated stories simultaneously. Some abstract phrasing ("texture of memories") could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bureaucratic error, maritime setting, and memory collection creates an original meditation on identity persistence. The specific detail of the poison label becoming the anchor for borrowed histories, combined with the tide-driven structure, transforms familiar themes of erasure into something distinctive.</comment>
