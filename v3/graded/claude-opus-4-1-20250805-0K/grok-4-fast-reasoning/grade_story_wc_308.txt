I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as the piece builds through layered imagery and resonant patterns rather than causal plot mechanics, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara achieves her centuries-long goal.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—centuries of pursuing navigation without movement—and her final choice to merge with the arrowhead's pulse carries visible cost. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("harmonic stone skimmer," "weathered resolve") rather than embodied emotional states, and the piece lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate to higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Elara achieves her goal of unmoving navigation, with visible cost in her "eternal vigil" and being "unbound." The accumulative lens holds consistently through layered imagery building to this transformation. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the cost, though "the world would come to her" and "eternal vigil" make the price legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The canyon of bone towers creates genuine atmospheric pressure and the arrowhead constrains Elara's choice at the climax. Setting details like "towers of bone rose like forgotten sentinels" and "endless echoes" aren't mere decoration—they embody the weight of time that drives Elara's quest. The bird patterns directly enable the resolution, making environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (learning to navigate without moving) is signaled early and deepens through the bird-reading sequence, where Elara must risk merging with a potentially dangerous "wandering pulse." The cost is visible in her acceptance of "eternal vigil" and the warning that "not all lost essences wished to be found" creates genuine tension about her choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between stillness and movement, with the final image of Elara "unbound" yet rooted offering a non-literal answer to the navigation paradox. The bird patterns and bone towers create resonant imagery without explicit moralizing. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("harmonic skimmer") that doesn't fully ground the thematic work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The elevated, mythic voice maintains consistency with controlled rhythm and distinctive texture ("dust-choked dawn," "forgotten oaths"). POV remains stable with appropriate narrative distance for this centuries-old guardian. Some register elevation ("inexorably homeward," "cataclysmic wars") fits the epic scope though occasionally tips toward purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery. However, abstract phrases like "harmonic stone skimmer" and "weathered resolve" appear multiple times without clarification, and some elevated diction ("inexorably," "cataclysmic") creates occasional opacity. The text maintains momentum despite these moments of abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of navigation through stillness offers a fresh paradox, and the synthesis of bird divination with ancient bone architecture creates an original mythic framework. The "wandering pulse" trapped in stone since ancient wars transforms familiar quest elements through specific world-building. The risk of merging consciousness with an unknown essence heightens stakes effectively.</comment>
