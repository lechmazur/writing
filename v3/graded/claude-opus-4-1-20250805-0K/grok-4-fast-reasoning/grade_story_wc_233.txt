<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's disenchantment and dream-driven motivation are established early and maintained, though her internal contradiction operates more through summary than embodied scene work. The shared exhale with Lirian revealing mutual dreams provides a concrete micro-choice, but the resolution through "softly commanding will" channeled into an incantation lacks the embodied specificity needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through a Decisive Change (curse broken, stars stabilized) with clear causal linkage from dreams to grotto to resolution. The "queen reborn yet forever marked" ending carries felt cost, though the mechanics of the incantation that "sealed the bleeding flow" remain vague, weakening the closure's specificity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto setting effectively constrains choice and charges the final image with "stars wheeling overhead, unnaturally close." Sensory details like "thorns snagged at her hem like insistent fingers" and "acrid scent of smoldering embers" create atmosphere, though the grotto's interior physical logic could be more precise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (confronting the dream mystery to heal or shatter her reign) is signaled early and escalates through the climb and grotto discovery. The resolution shows agency but the "channeled her softly commanding will" moment lacks the concrete mechanics that would make the cost fully legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The bleeding starlight motif successfully reweights from dream image to curse mechanism to resolved threat, creating thematic coherence. The "curse's lure, drawing her here" revelation provides earned insight, though the final wisdom about being "forever marked" tends toward abstraction rather than emerging from concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and atmospheric word choices like "whispered," "veiled threat," and "lacy menace." However, elevated diction occasionally drifts beyond Elara's established register ("resonant reconfiguration" implicit in the narration), and dialogue remains minimal, limiting voice distinction opportunities.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful imagery. Deductions for overwriting in places ("silken gown whispering against the stone floor like a veiled threat"), some register drift into elevated fantasy-speak, and the vague mechanics of the climactic incantation that weakens momentum at the crucial beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bleeding starlight concept offers a fresh angle on the cursed-ruler trope, with the curse feeding on despair as a specific mechanism. The shared exhale revealing mutual dreams between queen and guard provides an unexpected connection, though the resolution mechanics feel somewhat conventional for the fantasy genre.</comment>
