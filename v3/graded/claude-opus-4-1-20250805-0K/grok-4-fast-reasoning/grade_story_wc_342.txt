I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rigorous rubric for immediate publishability.

**Inferred Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered discoveries and pattern recognition rather than causal turns, with density increasing toward the final mural that synthesizes sky and faces.

<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's face blindness creates genuine constraint that shapes her artistic method and discovery. Her motivation to preserve the library through art is clear, though internal contradiction could be more embodied during the pivotal book discovery. The final choice to incorporate facial fractals shows credible growth within her established limits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure builds from stillness through discovery to creation, with the book safe revelation providing meaningful deepening. However, the closure's cost remains more conceptual than felt - "the oak's quiet gratitude" and "fractally precise in memory" lack the visible price needed for higher bands. The orientation anchors (dawn, elder oak library, demolition pending) establish clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hollow oak setting constrains choices effectively - knotholes filter light, bark whorls hide the safe, and impending demolition creates urgency. Sensory detail ("scent of aged paper and damp wood") grounds the space. The tree's grain patterns enable the discovery, making environment essential to plot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving the library's essence before demolition) is clear, with time pressure from approaching crews. The discovery deepens options rather than narrowing them, fitting the accumulative lens. However, the resolution lacks a sharp trade-off - Elara gains the book and completes the mural without meaningful sacrifice or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between Elara's face blindness and the guild's facial fractal method - both transcend conventional seeing through pattern recognition. The concept of "discovering limits meant not surrender, but infinite exploration within them" resonates without moralizing, and the final image of sky blooming with human fractals offers a non-literal answer to limitation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance. However, voice lacks distinctiveness - phrases like "her heart quickened" and "trembling precision" are stock rather than character-particular. The perceptual signature of focusing on textures over features is established but could be more consistently woven through observations.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Repetitive use of "fractal/fractally" (17 instances) creates template cadence that dulls impact. Phrases like "heightened stillness" appear 3 times verbatim, and "discovering limits" recurs mechanically. Several paraphrase loops exist: "faces dissolved into anonymity, a limit she had long accepted yet chafed against" restates rather than advances. These artifacts accumulate to reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of face blindness with artistic precision offers a fresh angle, and the hidden archive of facial fractals provides non-obvious discovery. However, the resolution feels safe - the protagonist succeeds without real opposition or cost. The concept of mapping "unseeable" faces through fractal patterns shows originality but lacks the bold risk-taking that would elevate further.</comment>
