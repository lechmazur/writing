<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's involuntary truthfulness creates genuine internal conflict as he struggles to preserve wonder while being unable to lie, manifesting in his creative use of riddles and the lacquer box. His motivation is consistent and embodied through specific actions, though the resolution with Lira feels slightly rushed without full exploration of the cost to his belief system.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira's understanding transforms despair into curiosity through Elias's riddle-wrapped truth, with the blackout's cause revealed as bio-engineered bee failure. Causality flows cleanly from setup through revelation, though the cost of the system failure could be more viscerally felt beyond the abstract "city dark."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lightning tower and its "skeletal giant" presence, the nectar dusk atmosphere, and the drone beehive revelation create a cohesive world where technology and nature interweave. The lacquer box and matchbox serve as micro-settings that constrain how truth is revealed, directly shaping the story's central choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder amid crisis—faces pressure through Lira's frustration and Elias's compulsion to tell truth, culminating in the riddle solution that maintains enchantment. While the escalation works under an Accumulative lens through layered revelation, the immediate consequences of the blackout don't create visceral urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of preserving wonder against routine's "creeping numbness" emerges organically through Elias's actions and the bee-electricity metaphor, where both drones and humans risk losing purpose to repetition. The riddle's poetry and final image of the "portal to enchantment" offer resonant answers without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent elevated diction ("nectar dusk," "skeletal giant") that matches the story's aim to enchant the mundane, with Elias's perception filtering everything through his wonder-preservation lens. Dialogue feels slightly formal but serves the riddle-revelation structure; some phrases like "creeping numbness" and "hollow echo" edge toward overwrought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("fireflies began their mimicry of lost power") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear pattern-teaching. Several abstract phrases ("gateway of mystery," "portal to enchantment") and repetitive constructions around wonder-preservation create mild momentum drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bio-engineered bee power system offers a fresh technological-natural hybrid, and the involuntary truthfulness compelling creative truth-telling through riddles presents genuine originality. The synthesis of lightning harvest, bee colonies, and human routine as parallel systems of potential stagnation feels earned and non-obvious.</comment>
