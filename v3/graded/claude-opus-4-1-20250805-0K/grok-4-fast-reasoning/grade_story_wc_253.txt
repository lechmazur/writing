<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's blank-faced performer identity creates genuine internal contradiction between her past role and current grief, with the whittling scene revealing values through micro-choices. The moral ambiguity of her propaganda work that "whispered doubts to those who listened in the dark" adds authentic complexity without false balance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's theatrical narration transforming grief into "tentative release," with visible emotional cost in the sister's memory. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through the whittling scene, though the worldbuilding backstory somewhat dilutes present-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The turbines as "colossal gods" and their "remade hush" effectively constrain Elara's world, while the dried bouquet and carved bird create micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography in the whittling scene is precise: "knife glided through the bark, peeling away layers in deliberate strokes."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake of cultivating lightness from grief deepens through the whittling act, where "each curl of shaving reveals the hidden form beneath" mirrors internal transformation. Cost is visible in the sister's memory stirring "no tears—the void allowed none," though escalation remains primarily textural rather than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the juxtaposition of enforced happiness versus authentic grief, with the carved bird offering a non-literal answer about freedom from emotional void. The final placement of bird beside bouquet "like a companion in fragility" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's theatrical voice creates distinct perceptual signature: "Behold, the noble art of shaping the unyielding wood!" maintains character consistency even under emotional pressure. The juxtaposition of blank face with dramatic narration shows excellent distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variation and information density, particularly in "Whittle by whittle, the bird took shape," though some overwriting appears: "hummed like forgotten gods," "creaking under the weight of enforced silences." Minor template cadence in repeated "whittle" constructions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The post-happiness-mandate world offers fresh dystopian angle, with Elara's role as former joy theater performer adding specificity. The concept of narrating mundane tasks theatrically to process grief shows genuine originality, though some worldbuilding elements feel derivative.</comment>
