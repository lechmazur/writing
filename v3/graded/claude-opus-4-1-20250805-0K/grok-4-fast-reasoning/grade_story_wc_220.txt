<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Harlan's motivation to bridge distance from Elara is embodied through concrete actions (tracing the cylinder, clutching the waxen leaf) with contradictory impulses between seeking truth and fearing revelation. The discovery that Elara survived but chose separation creates genuine internal conflict with visible cost. Minor deduction for some diagnostic phrasing ("reluctant heroism") in the resolution beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Harlan's acceptance that "no grand reunion awaited" while finding Elara's presence "in every cracked vista," with the leaf transformed from memorial to "talisman against isolation." The accumulative lens holds as details layer (phonograph discovery, riddle solving, tinted revelations) to reweight his understanding. Cost is felt in accepting permanent separation while gaining connection through echo. Minor deduction for slightly rushed revelation sequence in the final third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The scrapyard setting actively constrains and enables action—Harlan discovers the cylinder "from a gutted transport pod" among "circuit boards and shattered glass," his shack provides intimate space for examination. Strong sensory hierarchy through his bloodhound nose "flaring at ghosts of decay." The waxen leaf functions as micro-setting that "warming like a heartbeat" charges the final acceptance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative discovery: finding cylinder → decoding riddle → solving it as "echo" → intuiting Elara's voice → learning her survival and choice. The dominant stake (bridging distance to Elara) tightens as each revelation reframes possibility, culminating in acceptance with visible cost. The riddle provides genuine obstacle though its solution feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of echo—"that intangible force born from destruction, carrying voices across voids"—which resonates with the wasteland setting and Harlan's search. The leaf's transformation from memorial to "talisman against isolation" offers non-literal answer to loss. Slight deduction for "reluctant heroism" phrasing that edges toward explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature through Harlan's bloodhound sensibility: "he felt its stories in the rust's bite, the way a bent fender curved like a lover's sigh." Voice modulates effectively from descriptive opening through intimate discovery to acceptance. Prose maintains consistent lyrical register appropriate to the "wild hush" tone throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("earth split like forgotten promises," "sun bled orange across the cracks") and good momentum. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("veins woven like veins in the leaf") and occasional register elevation ("reluctant heroism," "wild heart") that slightly dulls immediacy. Clean grammar and varied syntax support the accumulative structure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The phonograph cylinder containing hidden text rather than sound offers fresh angle on post-apocalyptic discovery. Harlan as retired body-finder turned memory-seeker provides specific perspective. The revelation of Elara's survival but forced separation avoids expected death/reunion binary, though the wasteland setting itself follows familiar templates.</comment>
