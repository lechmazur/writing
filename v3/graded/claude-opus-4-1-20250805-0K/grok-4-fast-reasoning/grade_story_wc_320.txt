I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—discarding assumptions aloud while tuning signals—with her philosophy "finding beginnings in endings" driving the closure choice. The internal contradiction between her interpreter's need for clarity and her faith in the fragment creates genuine tension. However, some interiority edges toward diagnostic self-awareness ("artifacts like this demanded interpretation, not blind faith") that slightly dulls authenticity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's discovery of the "shard of hush" that reveals renewal patterns in the ruins, with cost implied through the city's abandonment and her "years of loss." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and symbolic elements build toward the final vision. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The suspended tower city creates genuine spatial pressure through "gaps in the floor" and "yawning gorge," constraining Elara's movements and choices. Sensory detail layers effectively ("rusted railing," "weathered metal grid," "creaks and the abyss"). The setting directly enables the story's resolution—the abandoned broadcast infrastructure becomes the mechanism for cosmic reception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure builds through Elara's methodical ascent and the interference requiring her to discard assumptions, creating a meaningful deepening when she achieves signal clarity. The lunar perigee provides temporal pressure. Cost manifests as she must release her biases "like pebbles into the void," though the stakes could intensify further through more immediate physical or emotional risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete action of signal interpretation in ruins, avoiding direct moralizing. The "beginning in every ending" philosophy manifests through specific images: "gorge's depths birthing new life from eroded stone." The Hollywood star fragment bridges earthly spectacle to cosmic truth without heavy-handed symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical-poetic register appropriate to Elara's interpreter profession ("parabolic curve a practical relic of fantasy engineering"). Perceptual signature shows through selective attention to signal-related details. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("glamour-soaked streets," "electric allure of dreams made manifest") but generally serve the fantastical tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves solid clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. However, several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("felled by some ancient catastrophe," "nomadic fleets") and the phrase "serenely electric" appears twice, creating unnecessary repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The celestial signal interpreter profession offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic exploration, transforming the abandoned city trope through specific cosmic communication mechanics. The synthesis of Hollywood glamour with stellar interpretation creates unexpected resonance. The method of discarding assumptions as physical ritual ("casting pebbles") shows genuine invention.</comment>
