<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity about old buildings drives consistent choices through tea sessions to rooftop revelation, with her questioning intensifying as trust builds. The "mysterious familiarity" between characters creates effective ambiguity though Thorne's motivations remain somewhat abstract. The final seal exchange carries weight as both gift and burden, though the emotional cost could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as weekly tea sessions deepen understanding until the rooftop crystallizes into confession and seal-passing. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Elara hears the building's voice as "familiar lullaby" rather than "eerie whispers," with the seal as talisman marking her acceptance of this burden. Cost is primarily conceptual—accepting responsibility for hidden knowledge—though more embodied consequence would strengthen.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Victorian tenement functions as living character with its "warped floors," "shadowed corners," and cornerstone emblem that mirrors the desk seal. The rooftop garden during meteor shower provides atmospheric pressure for revelation. Setting actively constrains through the building's "groans" and "shadows" that demand interpretation, charging the final image of structure-as-lullaby.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes build from borrowing sugar through weekly lessons to direct confrontation: "Tell me the real language of this place." The meteor shower creates natural pressure for truth-telling, though the escalation could tighten further. The cost of knowledge—bearing the building's secrets—manifests in the seal's weight as "talisman," though consequences remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through layers: dead languages parallel hidden histories, "agreed upon lies" mask deeper truths, and buildings speak through "emotions imprinted." The final revelation that buildings carry grief and joy in their structure resonates without moralizing. The seal-passing ritual under meteors creates symbolic weight, though the "homecoming" metaphor edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains literary consistency with phrases like "silent stories etched into stone" and "meteors began streaking across the sky." POV control is clean with no head-hopping, though Thorne's interiority remains opaque. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("Borrow it as long as you like; neighbors share more than sweeteners"), distinguishing characters through formality levels.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose tends toward overwriting with stacked metaphors ("steam from Earl Grey mingled with the scent of aged books and wax") and abstract formulations ("mysterious familiarity blooming into confession"). Several paraphrase loops appear ("agreed upon lies, polite fictions"). The meteor shower description maintains atmosphere but "silent symphony" strains coherence. Line-level control wavers between vivid specificity and purple abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The concept of buildings as emotional archives offers a fresh angle, particularly the idea that emotions imprint physically into structure. The "agreed upon lies" between neighbors creates interesting social dynamics. However, execution relies on familiar gothic atmosphere tropes and the mentor-student arc follows predictable patterns without significant transformation.</comment>
