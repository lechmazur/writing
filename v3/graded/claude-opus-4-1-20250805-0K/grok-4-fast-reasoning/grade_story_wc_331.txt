<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is consistent and her sanely eccentric nature manifests through concrete actions (collecting footnotes, methodical scarf ritual). The final moment shows genuine cost as she carries "reawakened echoes into the library's endless night," though internal contradiction could be more embodied during the ritual itself rather than summarized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through hyperbolic geometry ritual to the vision sequence. Resonant Reconfiguration lands via Charged Poise—Elara glimpses the "eternal archive" with felt cost in her "profound, observed solitude." Orientation anchors (library, midnight, Elara) establish early, though the conceptual cost could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The library setting actively constrains choices through its "dim hush" and patron presence, while the scarf's hyperbolic patterns become the mechanism for revelation. Sensory details like "silk catching lamplight in ripples" and "threads humming like taut strings" create lived-in specificity that charges the final vision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding where stories truly live) progresses through deliberate ritual to vision, with meaningful deepening when analog memories reveal the "hyperbolic realm within the library's core." Cost appears in Elara's racing heart and the weight of carrying these echoes forward, though agency could be tested more directly against obstacles.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete opposition of digital/analog and the hyperbolic geometry that allows infinite narrative expansion. The ending's "analog weave connecting minds across time's bent horizons" offers resonant answer without moralizing, though the concept of stories living in physical objects versus bytes could develop through more embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "equations danced with metaphors" and "non-Euclidean sea" maintains voice coherence. POV control remains stable with selective attention to library details, though some passages lean toward elevated register ("profound, observed solitude") that slightly distances from Elara's immediate experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("scholars debating entropy's rhyme"). Some elevated diction in peak moments ("veiled intimacy," "cosmic lyre") creates mild register drift, and occasional template cadence appears ("She believed...She traced...She saw") though momentum largely sustains through varied syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library science, non-Euclidean geometry, and memory theory creates memorable premise. The specific fusion of "quantum sonnets and fractal haikus" with hyperbolic geometry as portal mechanism shows genuine originality, elevated by risk-taking in the abstract concept made tangible through silk and ink.</comment>
