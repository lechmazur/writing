<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes through concrete retrocognitive visions that trap her in others' pain, driving her "aberrant mercy" toward the ritual renaming. The internal contradiction between being trapped by the past yet using it as a tool for healing works well. Deduction for some abstract phrasing around "gentle radical" and "warm coldness" that occasionally drifts toward conceptual labels rather than embodied states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the renaming ritual serving as Resonant Reconfiguration—the plaza transforms from wound to sanctuary with visible cost (Elara's deeper entrapment that becomes "a tool now, not chains"). The orientation anchors (ancient plaza, after the fire) establish context early. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical progression through the ritual steps without enough pressure variation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tessera's chipped patterns constrain and enable the ritual, while the plaza's transformation from ruins to "Aether's Embrace" charges the final image. Strong integration of setting as active participant through the mosaic stone's encoded script and the shattered sky's aurora of ash. The vines emerging "not wild but purposeful" effectively shows environmental response to the renaming.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming collective trauma into healing—deepens through Elara's ritual with visible cost (her deeper entrapment in retrocognition). The tessera discovery provides meaningful tightening that enables the renaming. However, the emergence of survivors feels slightly convenient and lacks the pressure buildup that would elevate the stakes further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of renaming that transforms curse to caution, with the tessera serving as witness to radical mercy. The concept of "aberrant mercy" that forgives even arsonists resonates without explicit moralizing. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("gentle radicalism bloomed in warm coldness") that could be more grounded in specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and distinctive perceptual signature through retrocognitive visions. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("auroras of ash," "luminous kites under an unscarred heaven") that feels slightly removed from Elara's immediate experience. The ritual incantation voice works but creates brief tonal inconsistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Some elegant phrasing ("jagged fissures wept auroras of ash") but periodic overwriting with abstract conceptual language ("gentle radical," "warm coldness"). Template cadence appears in the ritual sequence ("She saw... She renamed... She spoke..."). Information density is good but occasional paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("no longer fully trapped, her retrocognition a tool now, not chains" restates the transformation).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The retrocognitive trap that becomes a healing tool offers fresh angle on trauma and recovery. The specific detail of the tessera's encoded ritual adds originality. However, the "wounded healer transforms community through mystical means" arc follows familiar patterns without sufficient transformation to reach higher bands.</comment>
