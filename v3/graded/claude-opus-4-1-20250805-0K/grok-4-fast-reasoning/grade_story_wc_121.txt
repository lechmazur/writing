<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "conquer the labyrinth of self" drives consistent choices, but internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—her doubts are told as "serpents" rather than shown through competing impulses. The gravity-defying ability functions well as externalized agency. Character change occurs but relies on abstract resolution ("timelines fusing") rather than a concrete choice with visible personal cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration ("her self whole at last") but the cost remains abstract—"timelines fusing in a cascade of light" doesn't show what Elara sacrifices or loses. The labyrinth sequence follows causal linkage but the revelation that it's "her own creation" arrives without setup. Orientation anchors establish by ~120 words though the viaduct-to-labyrinth transition blurs spatial logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct creates strong atmosphere and the labyrinth's "procedural generation" from memories effectively makes setting psychological space. Sensory detail works best early ("water droplets clung to her skin like forgotten stars"). The labyrinth walls that "rose and fell" provide spatial dynamics that affect navigation choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—conquering internal fragmentation—progresses through confronting shadow-selves and retracing choices, with one meaningful tightening when darker timelines emerge. However, the resolution ("With a defiant surge, she conquered it") lacks specificity about what conquering costs or requires beyond assertion of will. The confrontation with the doppelganger shows agency but resolves too easily.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The fractured timeline concept emerges through concrete labyrinth navigation but resolution relies on abstract fusion rather than earned integration. "The labyrinth was her own creation" attempts thematic reversal but arrives without groundwork. The ending image of being "whole at last in the periodically eternal now" gestures at theme but doesn't reweight prior material with specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with elevated register appropriate to the fantastical premise, though diction occasionally strains ("darkening brightness that promised revelation"). POV remains stable in third-limited. Some effective rhythmic control appears in shorter sentences during action ("Elara floated forward") but tends toward uniform complexity elsewhere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose suffers from abstract figurative language that obscures concrete action: "timelines fusing in a cascade of light" and "fractured timelines...leaving her soul scattered across what-ifs." Template phrasing appears ("She had glimpsed...and now...she would"). The labyrinth section improves with clearer action but resolution returns to abstraction. Line "between the drop and the ripple" effectively captures suspended time.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The procedurally-generated psychological labyrinth offers a fresh angle on internal conflict externalized as space. The concept of confronting alternate timeline selves has originality. However, execution relies on familiar fantasy tropes (ancient tablet, glowing architecture) without sufficient transformation, and the resolution's abstraction undermines the conceptual promise.</comment>
