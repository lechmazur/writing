<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong characterization with clear motivation (understanding the physics of letting go) and embodied emotion through the snow globe talisman. Elias's relationship with Mort shows sophisticated internal conflict, and his analytical nature drives meaningful choices. Minor weakness in occasional overwrought introspection, but the character arc from grief to understanding feels earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clear orientation and closure that lands with conceptual repricing about letting go. However, the causality linking the radio discovery to the final epiphany feels convenient rather than inevitable - the connection between untangling literal threads and understanding emotional release lacks strong causal grounding. The accumulative structure works but some key turns feel arranged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid underwater setting that constrains choices and drives the narrative. The sunken library concept is compelling and well-realized, with good sensory detail filtered through POV. The environment actively shapes discovery and understanding, though some descriptions lean slightly ornate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clear dominant stake with meaningful tightening when finding the radio and note. However, escalation feels more accumulative than driven by protagonist agency - the final understanding comes without visible struggle or cost. The insight feels granted rather than fought for under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the underwater archaeology metaphor without heavy-handed moralizing. The "physics of letting go" concept develops well through concrete images and action. Minor weakness in some slightly forced thematic connections, but the final conceptual repricing reweights prior material effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited with distinctive perceptual signature and controlled psychic distance. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels unnatural to the character ("sophisticated melancholy," "melancholic undercurrents"). Some filter verb overuse dulls immediacy in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clear prose with beautiful imagery, but significant overwriting issues. Dense figurative language in most sentences of high-pressure beats without clear payoff, purple prose tendencies, and repetitive elevated diction. Phrases like "sophisticated melancholy" and "melancholic undercurrents of discovery" create register drift that clashes with natural narrative voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis combining underwater archaeology with personal grief processing. The specific pairing of Earhart's disappearance with a sunken library feels inventive and non-obvious. The metaphorical framework of "untangling" is somewhat predictable once established, but the emotional specificity elevates familiar material.</comment>
