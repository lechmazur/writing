<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation through chess metaphor and exile is clear, with concrete embodiment through the worry stone's dent marking "unchecked fury." The final choice to turn from the nexus shows genuine change with visible cost. Internal conflict operates through "hopeful melancholy" and his precise nature wrestling with the chaos of exile, though some interiority leans abstract ("beauty in the difficult" repeated without sufficient embodiment).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds through layered silences and correlations to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias realigns the covenant and transforms exile into "a board reset for deeper play." Cost is visible in the years of exile and the dent's "badge of endurance." Orientation anchors solidly (Elias, magnetic nexus, twilight), and the covenant's eclipse provides clear stakes that pay off when "no longer fully eclipsed."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—"iron in the soil pulled at compasses and souls alike," with ley lines that "twisted like black veins beneath the soil." The worry stone serves as recurring object that charges the final image. Setting actively shapes the resolution through "magnetic pulses that tugged at his veins like invisible strings."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of reclaiming the eclipsed covenant escalates through correlation of silences, with time pressure ("before the next phase: the moon's rise"). The revelation that the covenant was "hidden...waiting for one precise enough to reclaim its light" deepens options. Cost appears in exile's duration and the transformation required, though agency could be stronger in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chess metaphor and the transformation of exile from punishment to opportunity—"beauty unveiled itself in the difficult." The final image of "a board reset for deeper play" resonantly reweights the opening's loss without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the worry stone's evolution from fury-mark to "badge of endurance."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with chess metaphor threading throughout ("lattice of strategies," "knight to unveil hidden threats," "queen's promotion from pawn"). Some register elevation feels unmotivated ("lattice of strategies as intricate as the board itself"). POV control is stable, though occasional abstraction dulls immediacy ("hopeful melancholy settled over him").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("the sky bruising into purples and golds") but suffers from abstract repetition of "beauty in the difficult" and some overwrought metaphor. Template cadence appears in middle section ("Elias closed his eyes...He correlated them..."). Information density is moderate; several passages could compress without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The chess tutor using game logic to decode cosmic silence offers a fresh synthesis. The specific detail of the worry stone's single dent from "unchecked fury" particularizes the narrative. However, the "exiled wise man seeks redemption" frame is familiar, elevated somewhat by the precise correlation method.</comment>
