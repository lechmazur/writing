I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through sensory layering and synesthetic imagery toward a resonant reconfiguration where Eliza's despair transforms through shared performance with the ghost.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eliza's synesthesia creates a distinctive perceptual signature ("sounds blooming into colors, touches whispering tastes"), and her despair from the theater troupe's end motivates her maze navigation. The ghost character applies immediate pressure through the tarot coin exchange and shared performance. However, the transformation from despair to hope feels slightly rushed in the final beats without sufficient embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Eliza and the ghost's "intertwined echoes" create mutual fulfillment—his encore granted, her despair lifted through shared artistry. The fractured timeline concept meaningfully constrains the ghost's existence and enables the resolution. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract treatment of "possibilities flickered like fireflies" without more concrete cost visualization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mystic orchard setting actively shapes the encounter—"gnarled apple trees heavy with fruit that glowed faintly" creates the liminal space where ghost and human can interact. Synesthetic details like "the orchard's perfume, which painted her tongue with sweet memories" ground the POV's unique perception. The maze-within-park layering provides necessary isolation for this supernatural meeting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: from Eliza's initial despair through the coin exchange to the climactic shared dance where "echoes blooming into tapestries of color." The ghost's need for an encore creates genuine pressure. However, the resolution arrives somewhat easily—"despair recede, nostalgia rising" lacks the visceral cost or trade-off that would elevate the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of artistic legacy and shared performance emerges organically through the ghost-performer parallel and the "intertwined echoes" that bridge fractured timelines. The tarot coin as "binding timelines" works symbolically without overstatement. The ending image of "luring hope from the shadows" resonates with the opening despair without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synesthetic POV creates distinctive voice—"his voice a melody that unfurled in Eliza's mind as swirling crimson ribbons." Free indirect style maintains Eliza's perspective cleanly throughout. Some elevated diction ("vaudeville specter tied to the land") occasionally drifts from the established theatrical register but remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery like "Lanterns strung like fireflies swayed gently, casting patterns that danced across Eliza's vision in soft, nostalgic indigo." Minor issues with abstract phrasing ("possibilities flickered like fireflies—new stages, revived troupes") and some density in the middle section where multiple metaphors cluster without advancing action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synesthetic protagonist encountering a performance-hungry ghost in a hidden orchard creates an original synthesis. The fractured timeline concept and the specific detail of "hand-painted tarot coin, its surface etched with intricate pentacles" add texture. The resolution through shared performance rather than conflict offers a fresh approach to ghost-story conventions.</comment>
