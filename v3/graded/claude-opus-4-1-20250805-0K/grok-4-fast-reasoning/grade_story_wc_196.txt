<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliza's grief-driven motivation and transformation from brokenness to "tentative mending" through discovering Josiah's story creates genuine character arc with embodied emotion ("ink-stained fingers," "perpetual shadow under her eyes"). The parallel between her loss and Josiah's separated family drives meaningful change. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional processing ("something tactfully hopeful") rather than fully embodied response.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with dust patterns revealing hidden histories, building to Eliza's resolution to preserve Josiah's story—a Resonant Reconfiguration with emotional cost visible in her "tentative mending." Causality holds through discovery sequence. Deduction for slightly abstract cost articulation ("quiet bloom") and orientation taking until ~150 words to fully establish the 1867 Reconstruction setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The file room's atmosphere ("musty," "sagging wooden cabinets," dust motes as "secretive script") constrains discovery method and charges the final image of archives exhaling "in gratitude." Dust patterns function as micro-setting that enables plot. Strong sensory work throughout with purposeful selective detail reflecting Eliza's archival focus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from personal grief to preserving forgotten histories, with dust patterns forcing careful exploration and the button/letter discovery narrowing focus to Josiah's specific story. The resolution to transcribe represents meaningful choice with clear trade-off (engaging with loss to preserve others' stories). Limited by single-beat escalation structure typical of discovery narrative at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of "small kindnesses" magnified through forgotten histories emerges organically from Josiah's carved doll and pressed wildflowers—concrete particulars rather than abstractions. The ending reweights Eliza's grief through parallel loss without stating moral. Minor deduction for slight thematic echo in "small kindnesses" phrase appearing twice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with period-appropriate diction ("outpost," "infantryman," "reconstruction") and controlled psychic distance. Voice modulates from detached observation to intimate revelation as Eliza engages with discovered story. Strong perceptual signature in how she reads dust patterns. Minor repetition in sentence openings mid-story.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm supporting discovery pacing. Multiple instances of paraphrase loops ("small kindnesses" concept restated, dust patterns described redundantly) and some overwriting in metaphorical density ("veil," "bloom," "illuminate"). Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions across 3+ sentences. Information density high in discovery sequence but dulled by conceptual repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Reconstruction-era bureaucracy with personal grief creates non-obvious angle on historical fiction. Dust patterns as discovery method and the parallel between Eliza's loss and Josiah's separation offer specific innovation. The carved doll from rifle stock and pressed Pennsylvania wildflowers provide memorable specifics beyond generic period detail.</comment>
