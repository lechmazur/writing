<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's gift of tasting memories provides clear motivation that intensifies through absorption of stored remorse. The internal conflict between her need to heal others and the cost to herself creates genuine tension. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat mechanical in the pavilion sequence, and the transformation lacks sufficient embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms from brittle to sturdy through absorbing remorse, with cost shown in "chill seeping into her bones." The causal chain from rain → pools → hidden pavilion → transformation follows logic but relies on convenient discovery. The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words with "desert fortress of Kharidun."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The coral icebound pavilion beneath desert dunes creates striking incongruity that charges the climax. Sensory detail excels in "bioluminescent veins in the ice" and "frozen rivulets formed intricate maps of sorrow." The impossible preservation "by ancient sorcery or the dream's unspoken logic" constrains Elara's choices in the pavilion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's need to transform accumulated remorse before it breaks her—is signaled early and tightens when she discovers the pavilion's crystallized memories. However, the resolution lacks earned struggle; she simply absorbs orbs one by one without meaningful resistance or tactical adaptation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of transforming pain into wisdom emerges through Elara's gift and the pavilion's stored memories. The final image of her emerging "ready to cook a feast that would heal rather than haunt" offers resonant closure. But the transformation feels too neat, lacking complexity in how remorse becomes "polished lessons."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "walls of sun-bleached stone stood defiant" and specialized vocabulary around cooking and memory. However, register drift appears in abstract passages ("emotional contagion through touch") and the prose lacks distinct perceptual signature during the critical pavilion sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors ("sandpaper those rough memories smooth," "festering in her palate") and purple constructions ("fleeting promise," "unspoken dream"). Template cadence appears in the pavilion sequence with repetitive "she [verb]" structures. The prose achieves moments of clarity but stumbles through ornamental density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of a chef tasting memories offers fresh potential, and the coral ice pavilion beneath desert sands creates striking incongruity. However, execution relies on familiar fantasy tropes (ancient sorcery, crystallized memories) without sufficient transformation through specific lived detail.</comment>
