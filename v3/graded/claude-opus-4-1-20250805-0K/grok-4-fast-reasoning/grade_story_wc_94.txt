<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to chart his scars and break censorship drives concrete action (descending with the envelope), with internal contradiction between furious emotion and tranquil resolve embodied throughout. The transformation from vigil to action shows earned change with visible cost. Loses points for some abstract interiority ("cartography of scars") and occasional diagnostic phrasing ("furiously tranquil" used as self-aware label).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern intensification through storm imagery building to decisive action. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid when Elias descends with the envelope, crystallizing his choice to "redraw the maps" with visible risk. Who/where/when anchored early (observatory, storm night). Deduction for somewhat abstract cost—the danger of courier delivery is stated but not fully dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory constrains choices excellently—isolation forces introspection, the trapdoor provides singular exit, lightning illuminates path. Sensory detail vivid ("red glow flickering like a heartbeat," "thunder rumbled like distant applause"). The setting directly enables the final descent into danger. Minor deduction for some generic storm descriptions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds from internal vigil through timer's pressure to decisive action of retrieving and carrying the envelope down. The timer creates temporal pressure that forces the choice. However, external stakes remain somewhat abstract—we know censorship exists but don't see immediate antagonistic pressure, reducing tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of scars-as-navigation emerges organically through imagery and Elias's specific journey from censored poet to active resistance. The final image of emerging "into the storm's embrace" resonates without stating a moral. Slight deduction for one explicit thematic statement ("Scars are the stars we navigate by") that edges toward telling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and poetic compression ("stormlit," "storm-kissed wonder"). POV remains stable with clear focalization through Elias. Perceptual signature strong in how he reads the storm as "distant applause" and sees "cartography" in scars. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds character voice ("rarefying his purpose into unyielding resolve").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Deductions for repetitive use of "storm-kissed wonder" (appears twice), "furiously tranquil" (twice), and "cartography of scars" (twice) creating mild template feel. Some elevated diction borders on purple ("tempests that mirrored his inner turmoil").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The observatory-as-refuge-for-censored-poet offers a solid metaphorical frame, and the darkroom timer as meditation device shows creativity. The hidden-poem-in-timetable method is specific and memorable. However, the "poet contemplates in storm" setup follows familiar patterns without radical transformation.</comment>
