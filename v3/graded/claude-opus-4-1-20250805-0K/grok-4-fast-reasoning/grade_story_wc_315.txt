<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes through embodied stress (trembling hands, muscle memory) and contradictory impulses (doubt versus duty), with her final choice to revise the log carrying visible stakes for colony trust. The "watcher's burden" manifests physically and psychologically throughout. Minor deductions for some abstract phrasing ("suffocating weight of solitary judgment") and occasional diagnostic language that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong causal lens with clear closure—Elara's revision of the log prevents defensive misfire and preserves trust, with cost visible in her isolation and burden. The orientation anchors (nocturnal arbor, sky colonies, pattern seeker role) establish cleanly by ~120 words. Deduction for cost being somewhat abstract rather than showing specific sacrifice or loss; the "burden lingered" doesn't fully dramatize what she pays.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The arbor setting actively constrains choice through the parachute buckle mechanism and height-induced isolation, while the "soundless echo" creates atmospheric pressure throughout. Strong micro-setting work with the buckle's hidden compartment and stylus. The environment shapes tactics (signal amplification, emergency descent capability) and charges the final image of branches "cradling her like an old guardian."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from pattern observation to active threat identification to crucial revision that prevents colony defensive misfire. The pressure tightens when Lir's urgent query forces immediate clarity, and Elara's choice to revise carries clear consequences. Minor deduction because the antagonistic threat (rogue gliders) appears somewhat late and lacks fuller development of what makes them dangerous beyond "intentional sabotage."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of trust under isolated pressure emerges through concrete action—Elara's solitary vigilance maintaining fragile colony bonds. The "soundless echo" motif resonates as both physical setting and metaphor for her isolation. Deduction for explicit thematic statement ("embrace the watcher's burden") in the final paragraph and some abstract phrasing that could emerge more fully from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person with controlled psychic distance, strong perceptual signature (pattern-seeking, technical awareness), and voice that modulates under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but functional, carrying urgency and subtext. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("profound quiet," "nocturnal realm") that slightly exceeds Elara's established lexicon during stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum through the crisis moment. Strong specificity in technical details (bio-steel branches, solar fabric leaves, signal amplifier). Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "watcher's burden" (appears 4 times), some abstract constructions ("suffocating weight of solitary judgment"), and occasional overwriting in descriptive passages that slightly slows momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sky colony setting and pattern-seeker role offer a moderately fresh angle on surveillance fiction, with inventive details like bio-steel arbors and modified parachute buckles. However, the core watchman's dilemma and trust-under-pressure theme follow familiar templates without significant transformation. The specific world-building elevates somewhat but doesn't fully transcend the archetype.</comment>
