<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characters function adequately but lack embodied contradiction and specific interiority. Elias's altruistic ghost motivation is clear but other Grovekin remain generic archetypes (sharp-eyed botanist, wanderers). The collective transformation from strangers to family is told rather than dramatized through specific micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with the orchards' renewal through collective action, satisfying an Accumulative/Textural lens. However, the cost remains abstract—we see renewal but not what was sacrificed or risked. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words with planet, arches, and situation established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains and enables—the floating arches provide shelter, the butterfly garden holds the solution, the Nebula supplies renewal elements. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("luminous veins of quartz," "morning dew on petals"). The orchard planet functions as more than backdrop, directly shaping the conflict.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (saving the dying orchards) but escalation is gentle rather than pressurized. The single tightening moment—discovering the butterfly garden and bell—lacks opposition or genuine risk. Agency exists through collective choice but no visible price is paid or alternative foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of collective effort versus isolation emerges organically from plot. The chalk messages work as subtext driving reexamination. However, the resolution trends toward explicit moralizing ("family's collective effort a testament") rather than resonant image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent omniscient distance with occasional lyric touches. POV control is stable but lacks distinct perceptual signature—the narration could belong to any literary observer. Prose modulates somewhat with the ghost's appearance but doesn't achieve memorable texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and rhythm. Some overwriting appears ("brambles of despair," "thorny, resilient, and eternally entwined") but doesn't obscure clarity. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance story though some border on ornamental.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The altruistic ghost as community catalyst offers a fresh angle on the found-family trope. Specific world-building (floating arches, Nebula of Respite) creates distinctiveness. However, the resolution follows expected patterns without surprising synthesis or risk-taking that would elevate further.</comment>
