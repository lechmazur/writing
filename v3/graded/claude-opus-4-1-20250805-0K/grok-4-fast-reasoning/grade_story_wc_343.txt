<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity drives concrete discovery choices and her "sociable isolation" creates authentic internal contradiction, though the resolution feels convenient without earned struggle. The polyglot phrasebook discovery and cipher-solving show embodied action under self-imposed pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Causal lens with discovery leading to revelation, but closure lacks visible cost—Elara finds the luminance map without sacrifice or trade-off. The piece anchors who/where/when effectively and maintains single-scene unity, yet the ending projects future action rather than landing a decisive change on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The airship setting with its "creaking timbers" and "forgotten storage hold" actively enables discovery, while starling murmurations create atmospheric pressure. The dusty hold and weathered plank constrain Elara's search methods, making setting integral to the plot's unfolding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on Elara's desire for cartographic fame, but escalation remains internal without external pressure or meaningful obstacles. The discovery proceeds smoothly from curiosity to revelation without reversals or costs that would force difficult choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of hidden knowledge emerges through concrete discovery of the cipher and "stranded luminance," avoiding abstract statements. The hopscotch board as deliberate safeguard adds thematic depth about protecting dangerous knowledge, though the ending doesn't fully explore the "peril if mishandled" warning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "diligently curious mind" and selective perception focused on cartographic details. Some overwriting appears ("luminous wonders," "ethereal waypoints") but the POV remains stable and the perceptual signature stays character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose flows smoothly but suffers from ornate phrasing ("starling murmurations danced like living inkblots") and repetitive structure. Filter phrases like "Elara felt" and "she realized" dull immediacy in key discovery moments. The text lacks the propulsion needed for stronger engagement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The hopscotch cipher concept offers originality, transforming a children's game into navigational code. However, the convenient discovery and smooth revelation path follow familiar treasure-hunt patterns without fresh complications or earned struggle.</comment>
