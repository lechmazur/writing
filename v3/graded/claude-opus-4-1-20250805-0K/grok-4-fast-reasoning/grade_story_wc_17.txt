I'll evaluate this story as a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation builds from abstract (walls' dreams) to concrete family burden through discovered diaries, with her "sensitively perceptive" trait enabling specific actions like distinguishing "a sigh from a creak." The transformation from fleeing legacy to embracing repair duty lands with cost, though internal contradiction could be more simultaneous rather than sequential.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory echoes and discovered artifacts build to Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts rather than flees her burden—"no longer a burden to flee, but a map to follow." Cost is legible in "weight settled on her, heavier than the ivy outside," though the final beat could sharpen the price of this acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains through ivy-choked passages that "lean in, listening" and climate-shifted landscapes, with micro-setting (the negative strip) charging the final revelation. The manor functions as archive and confessional, though some descriptions ("damp air clinging to her skin like regret") edge toward overwriting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from mapping echoes to confronting family guilt through the discovered artifacts, with meaningful tightening when negatives reveal "walls dreaming of verdant worlds undone." The burden transforms from weight to guide, though escalation could benefit from more active resistance before acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete discoveries—half-burned diaries revealing industrial sins now "echoing eternally in stone." The final reweighting of walls' dreams from isolation to "hope shared across time" offers resonant answer without moralizing, earned through specific family history rather than abstract environmentalism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register with controlled rhythm ("fractured world," "corridor echo cartographer") and perceptual signature focused on sound and vibration. Some moments risk purple prose ("damp air clinging to her skin like regret"), but overall texture supports the lyric-accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though figurative language occasionally overwhelms ("ivy choked the very air, its tendrils weaving through shattered windows like veins of green memory"). Minor template cadence in "She + verb" constructions mid-story, but closure beat maintains clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of mapping acoustic echoes to reveal emotional architecture feels fresh, particularly the synthesis of climate fiction with family guilt through photography negatives. The specific detail of walls dreaming "in shadows of what humans had wrought" transforms expected environmental themes.</comment>
