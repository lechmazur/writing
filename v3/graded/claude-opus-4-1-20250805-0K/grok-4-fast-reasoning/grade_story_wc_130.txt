<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation to "quantify heartache" through magical mathematics is character-specific and drives concrete action, though the emotional progression relies on abstract concepts rather than embodied contradiction. The ambiguous loss backstory provides consistent motivation, but internal conflict manifests more as melancholy persistence than active contradiction in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elowen reframes loss as "a new term, ambiguous yet integral." Cost is felt through the "years ago" weight and "echoes of laughter," though the transformation occurs primarily through magical revelation rather than earned struggle. The single-scene structure maintains coherence with clear who/where/when anchoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cavern orchard with its "stalactites wept crystalline tears" creates a vivid, constraining environment that shapes Elowen's magical practice. The mosaic stone's "fractured geometries" directly enables the dovetailing action, making setting integral to plot mechanics rather than decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding/quantifying grief—remains consistent but lacks meaningful tightening since Elowen's magical experiment succeeds without complication or reversal. Agency manifests through her inventive conjuring, but pressure doesn't escalate; the revelation arrives smoothly without forcing trade-offs or narrowing options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mathematical metaphor of emotion as "variables" and "equations," with loss becoming "not erasure but a new term." The dovetailing image—interlocking yet separate—resonates with the grief theme, though the final paragraph edges toward explicit thematic statement with "understanding, even partial, could dovetail grief into grace."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("secretive," "gently inventive"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated literary diction ("testament to resilient equations") that strains against Elowen's established voice, and some sentences run overly complex without serving pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dense figurative language appears in most sentences ("moon had risen high enough to silver the silence," "gnawed at her," "twisted like roots") without pattern-teaching, creating ornamental overwriting. Several paraphrase loops occur ("ambiguous loss"/"undefined and lingering," "quantify the heartache"/"mathematics of emotion"). The prose achieves atmosphere but sacrifices momentum to decorative language.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The concept of mathematically quantifying emotion through magical glass eyes offers a fresh angle on grief processing, avoiding therapy-speak clichés. The cavern orchard setting and taxidermist's eyes create specific texture, though the emotional arc follows a somewhat familiar pattern of loss-to-acceptance without surprising transformation.</comment>
