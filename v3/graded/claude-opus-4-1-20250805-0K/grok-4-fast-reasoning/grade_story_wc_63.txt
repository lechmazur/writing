<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied guilt through the pendulum pause visions and physical handling of the rake handle. The brother's spectral appearance and Elias's thirty-year penance create genuine internal conflict. Deducted for some abstract phrasing ("incremental absolution," "ethically diligent") that reads more like labels than lived experience, though the final choice to confess carries real cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the pendulum's pause triggering visions that build toward confession. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Elias emerges with the rake handle to share the inscriptions, with thirty years of guilt as visible cost. The mystical element (ghost, preserved rake) strains credibility slightly but serves the emotional truth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge functions as both physical threat and psychological mirror, constraining the fishermen's lives. The pendulum bob and tower create vertical tension against the tidal horizontals. Setting loses some points for abstract descriptors ("fractured mirrors," "shadowed core") over lived-in specificity, though the tide pools' bioluminescence provides concrete sensory anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from mechanical duty through personal guilt to communal healing. The pendulum pause deepens from routine to revelation, with the rake handle's inscriptions forcing acknowledgment. The thirty-year weight and brother's death establish clear cost, though the resolution feels slightly neat for such profound guilt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of incremental absolution through sustained duty resonates through clock-winding as penance. The inscriptions-as-confession and shared balance work well. However, the theme sometimes announces itself too directly ("incremental absolution," "shared balance") rather than emerging purely through image and action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance during the vision sequence. Strong rhythmic control in descriptions of the pendulum's swing and tidal movements. Some register elevation during emotional peaks ("sacred pause," "spectral yet achingly real") that doesn't quite match Elias's established voice as a clock winder.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm in the pendulum and tide descriptions. Multiple instances of abstract phrasing ("incremental absolution," "ethically diligent," "shared balance") that feel prompted rather than organic. Some overwriting in metaphorical passages ("tides that lapped against the tidal obsidian ridge," "fractured mirrors, whispering secrets") reduces immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pendulum pause as vision trigger offers a fresh mechanical approach to guilt and time. The inscribed rake handle as preserved confession is specific and moving. However, the core situation (guilt over brother's death, seeking forgiveness) follows familiar patterns without significant transformation beyond the clock-tower frame.</comment>
