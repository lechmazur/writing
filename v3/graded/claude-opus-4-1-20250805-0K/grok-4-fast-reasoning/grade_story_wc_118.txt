I'll evaluate this story systematically under the demanding editorial standards provided.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - The piece builds density through layered historical echoes, with Elowen's discovery creating a pattern break that reweights the central premise about collecting stories from walls.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation to collect stories from walls is consistently rendered through concrete actions like pressing her ear to plaster and tracing mortar lines. Her discovery of the medieval scholar's parallel quest creates a resonant mirroring that deepens her purpose. The character lacks internal contradiction or compelling flaws that would elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elowen's quest transforms from restoration to "dream anew in its wake," with visible cost in humanity's extinguished dreams. The accumulative structure coheres as historical layers converge in the final recognition. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words with "reclaimed silo library" and "after the last human dream had been dreamt."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The silo library functions as more than backdrop - its curved walls become "a bronze urn holding the ashes of human folly," constraining and enabling Elowen's method. Sensory detail like "soft creak of her footsteps" and "faint scent of smoke" grounds the atmosphere. The bronze quiet motif effectively charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake - uncovering the displaced axis that shifted human ambition - escalates through Elowen's discovery of the medieval scholar's parallel quest and the tapestry fragment. The deepening occurs when she recognizes her quest mirrors the scholar's, though the cost remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parallel between Elowen and the medieval scholar, both seeking to mend displacement through collected stories. The tapestry's dragons "mourning a tilt toward chaos" provides resonant imagery without forcing allegory. The final reframing from restoration to dreaming anew offers genuine thematic complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "bronze quiet of forgotten epochs" and controlled rhythm throughout. POV remains stable in close third. Some elevated diction ("displaced axis that had tilted the world's forgotten pivots") occasionally strains but serves the elegiac tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("displaced axis that had tilted the world's forgotten pivots"). Some repetition of "displaced" and "bronze" works thematically but borders on excessive. The final sentence effectively crystallizes the piece though "bronze eternity" risks purple prose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise of a historian collecting stories absorbed by walls in a post-dream world offers genuine freshness. The parallel discovery structure with the medieval scholar adds unexpected depth. However, the post-apocalyptic library setting carries familiar genre markers that prevent full originality.</comment>
