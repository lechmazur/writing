<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elowen's immortal ennui and dimensional awareness create clear motivation for seeking "what happens after goodbye," with the curse-driven vision sequence embodying internal conflict. However, the resolution lacks embodied cost—she remains "immortal still" with only abstract "void within her had cracked," missing the concrete price this rubric demands for higher scores.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes clear causality through the solar storm enabling the amulet's power, leading to Elowen's vision of transformation after death. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (she finds purpose in chasing storms), but cost remains conceptual rather than felt—"the void within her had cracked" lacks the visible price required for bands above 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite functions as more than backdrop—its walls respond to the storm, enable the dimensional breach, and ultimately settle with "promises of more." Strong sensory work with "walls that shimmered like fractured rainbows" and "kaleidoscope of what-ifs" creates a setting that constrains and enables the key choice to use the amulet.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (discovering what lies beyond immortal existence) is signaled early and tested when Elowen uses the cursed amulet. However, escalation remains internal—the vision sequence doesn't foreclose options or exact visible cost, as she emerges "unchanged, immortal still" with only abstract satisfaction rather than the trade-off this band requires.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of transformation versus stasis emerges organically through Elowen's journey from boredom to purpose, with the vision revealing "not darkness, but a vast, luminous hush where echoes reformed." The recurring "hushed thunder" motif charges the ending, though the resolution tends toward abstraction ("quiet revolution of the soul") rather than earned specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevation with controlled rhythm ("prismatic escondite," "dimensionally aware") and strong perceptual signature in how Elowen experiences the storm's effects. Some register drift appears in abstract passages ("vast, luminous hush where echoes reformed into new beginnings"), but overall the prose texture supports the immortal perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("walls that shimmered like fractured rainbows") but suffers from abstraction loops in crucial beats: "void within her had cracked," "quiet revolution of the soul," "purpose anew" remain conceptual rather than concrete. Template cadence appears in the resolution sequence ("She was unchanged... but the void... Intrigue had given..."), reducing propulsion at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of immortal ennui with dimensional awareness and cursed objects creates a fresh angle on eternal life. The specific vision of afterlife as "echoes reformed into new beginnings" rather than oblivion offers genuine insight, and the commitment to exploring immortal perspective through sensory-rich dimensional perception elevates beyond template approaches.</comment>
