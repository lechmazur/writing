<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to map "the geography of healing" through obituaries for the living is conceptually intriguing but remains mostly abstract. His choice to stay in the garden rather than board the ship suggests agency, but the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—we see contemplation without genuine struggle. The connection to Liora provides some grounding, yet their brief harbor meeting doesn't establish sufficient emotional stakes to justify the intimate projection that follows.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias discovering the thread and weaving it into his written obituary for Liora, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration through metaphorical connection. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual—"quiet resolve" and choosing solitude—without visible sacrifice or transformation. The orientation anchors (Elias in the garden after missing the ship) arrive clearly, but the closure lacks the felt weight needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden creates genuine atmosphere through "golden foliage drifted like forgotten memories" and "decaying petals and earth." The palace carpet's crimson thread becomes a micro-setting element that constrains choice when Elias unravels it for his craft. Setting effectively mirrors the internal state of elegant decay and isolation, though some descriptions edge toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding healing through written memorialization—remains abstract throughout. Elias's choice to stay signals some agency, and unraveling the thread represents a minor deepening, but neither action carries visible cost or genuinely narrows options. The piece lacks escalating pressure; Elias simply continues his established practice in a new location without meaningful resistance or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The weft thread metaphor elegantly connects physical unraveling to emotional mapping—"her absences...as threads binding her to renewal." The theme of presence within absence emerges organically through Elias's practice of writing obituaries for the living. The final image of continuing "one thread at a time" resonates without explicit moralizing, though the conceptual nature of the work prevents full emotional landing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias's contemplative nature, with controlled rhythm in passages like "Liora stands at the cliff's edge, her hair whipping in the salt wind." However, the voice occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("lonesome splendor," "geography of healing") without sufficient grounding. The embedded obituary provides textural variety, though the overall tone remains uniformly melancholic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative moments—"golden foliage drifted like forgotten memories onto moss-covered paths." Some figurative density threatens clarity ("cartographer of scars," "geography of healing") but doesn't fully obscure meaning. Minor template cadence appears in the "He [verb]" constructions mid-story. The writing achieves atmosphere but occasionally prioritizes poeticism over precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of obituaries for the living offers genuine freshness, transforming the death-writing genre through temporal inversion. Elias as a wanderer-scribe who captures essence before departure creates an original angle on loss and memory. The synthesis of physical unraveling with emotional cartography shows creative integration, though the execution remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally lived.</comment>
