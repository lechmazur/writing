<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal journey from isolation to considering descent shows consistent motivation, and Mira functions as an effective catalyst with her fault-tolerant oracle nature. However, the transformation feels somewhat rushed—Elara's shift from years of chosen isolation to readiness to leave happens too quickly without sufficient internal resistance or cost being dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward Elara's decision to descend. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the final image of preparing to descend, but the cost remains more conceptual than felt—we understand she'll leave her sanctuary but don't viscerally experience what she's losing. The bracketed meta-commentary about word count disrupts the ending's power.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mountain weather station creates effective atmospheric pressure with its "thin air" and "frost-laced windows," and the botanical illustration functions as micro-setting that constrains Mira's oracle method. The auroral lights provide consistent visual anchoring throughout, though some descriptions edge toward purple prose ("clouds clung like forgotten dreams").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's recognition of her isolated life's impermanence—is signaled early but lacks sufficient tightening through the middle. The story relies heavily on Mira's philosophical explanation rather than dramatized pressure that would force Elara's choice. The "swallowed truth" about potential catastrophe feels insufficiently developed as active threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of accepting uncertainty by "occupying margins" emerges through Mira's method and the smudged illustration metaphor. However, Mira's direct articulation of the theme ("Your truth...weighs heavy because you've let it settle in the center, not the edges") tends toward explicit moralizing rather than allowing the image to carry meaning alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevation with controlled metaphorical density, and Mira's dialogue carries appropriate oracular weight. The perceptual signature works well with attention to weather instruments and atmospheric details, though some passages drift into overwrought territory ("auroral sorrow" appears three times).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from overwriting with metaphor density too high for peak beats ("clouds clung like forgotten dreams," "veil," "ethereal dance" in opening alone). The bracketed meta-commentary about word count and adjustments severely disrupts momentum and reveals scaffolding. Template phrasing appears in emotional descriptions ("wave of auroral sorrow washed over her").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The concept of a fault-tolerant oracle who reads margins rather than centers offers modest freshness, as does the mountain weather station setting for existential crisis. However, the resolution—accepting uncertainty through metaphorical "smudging"—feels somewhat abstract and doesn't fully transform the familiar isolated-protagonist-achieves-insight template.</comment>
