<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand her scar and survival is consistent, with concrete embodied details like reaching for the hourglass and kneeling to dig. The internal conflict between seeking closure and living with survivor's guilt plays out through action. However, the plant telepathy feels convenient rather than costly, and emotional progression relies on some diagnostic language ("seeker of closure," "singular motivation").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the discovery of the opal and final realization. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts her survival's meaning, with felt emotional cost ("Tears came, opening the emotional wound"). Orientation anchors (tower, dawn, post-surgery) establish cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tower setting and garden provide concrete constraints that guide action (spiral stairs, locked door, digging site). Sensory details like "dewy greens" and "quartz that hummed" create atmosphere. The frosted hourglass and opal work as micro-settings that affect choices, though some descriptions lean generic ("silent waves," "soft meteor glow").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding survival's meaning—deepens through the digging sequence where plants guide Elara to the opal. The discovery creates a meaningful turn that reweights her scar's significance. Cost is visible in tears and emotional release, though escalation could be sharper as the digging feels extended without increasing resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete journey from wound examination to accepting "a miracle rerouted." The opal's vision and plant voices avoid direct moralizing, letting meaning arise from Elara's discovery that survival creates obligation to "weave new life from old ruin." The coffee rings motif and frozen/flowing hourglass create resonance without overstatement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on scars, healing, and natural elements. The plant telepathy creates a distinct narrative texture. However, register occasionally elevates beyond natural thought ("displaced miracle," "meteor hush") and some phrasing feels writerly rather than embodied ("the universe's gift misplaced").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose suffers from overwriting with dense figurative language ("mist from a forgotten sea," "meteor's streak") that slows momentum. Several paraphrase loops appear ("seeking closure"/"closure demanded action"). Template structures recur ("She + verb" patterns). Information density is uneven, with the digging sequence extending without adding new pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The concept of reading scars for stories offers a solid angle, and the plant telepathy adds uniqueness. However, execution relies on familiar grief/survivor guilt territory without transforming it significantly. The extended digging sequence and convenient discovery of grandmother's exact vision-granting opal feel mechanically convenient rather than inevitable.</comment>
