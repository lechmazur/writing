<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover hidden data drives consistent action, and her choice to lie twice shows meaningful agency with visible stakes. However, internal conflict remains largely intellectual rather than embodied—she "hesitates" but we don't feel contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final decision to protect the secret shows clear values hierarchy but lacks the visceral cost that would elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Earned Stasis—Elara becomes "secret guardian" with clear foreclosed path (exposure). The causal chain from anomaly discovery through coordinates to cover-up revelation holds cleanly. However, cost remains somewhat abstract ("not yet" suggests deferred consequence rather than present price), and the orientation wobbles with dense worldbuilding that delays grounding until ~200 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Digital environment ("server halls hummed with silence") and holographic interfaces ground the setting adequately. The coordinates providing specific Europa location (47 north, 19 east, 82 depth) add precision. Yet the setting rarely constrains choices—Elara's access seems unlimited except for one "corporate lockdown" easily bypassed, missing opportunities for environment to shape tactics or charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity about deleted files to uncovering corporate murder/cover-up, with one clear tightening when restricted files require protocol bypass. The piece follows causal lens adequately. However, Elara faces minimal opposition—her lies succeed immediately, access is granted instantly, reducing tension despite high nominal stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of absence/presence emerges organically through "digital mausoleum," deleted files that persist in shadows, and the final "absence was never truly final." The Orion-7 patch becomes a concrete symbol of recovered truth. Yet the corporate malfeasance angle feels generic, and the ending veers toward explicit thematic statement ("promise that absence was never truly final") rather than pure resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical register appropriate to Elara's role, with some effective moments ("digital mausoleum where profiles... lingered like ghosts"). However, prose often defaults to explanatory mode ("This was no mere glitch, but a breadcrumb trail") rather than immediate perception. Dialogue absence isn't penalized, but the narrative distance rarely modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Significant template cadence issues: "Elara [verb]" structures dominate, creating monotonous rhythm. Multiple paraphrase loops appear ("crashed on Europa"/"debris field on Europa's icy crust"). Overreliance on abstract descriptors ("unquenchable motivation," "brightly attentive eyes") over concrete detail. The prose achieves clarity but lacks propulsion, with many sentences doing single jobs rather than layering information.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The social media archive as repository for spaceship crash evidence offers a moderately fresh angle, combining corporate conspiracy with digital archaeology. The embedded coordinates in viral song metadata shows some ingenuity. However, the corporate cover-up resolution feels templated, and the piece doesn't fully exploit its unique premise of social networks preserving what official records erase.</comment>
