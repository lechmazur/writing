I'll evaluate this story under an **Accumulative/Textural lens** - the piece builds through layered details about the mill's history, radio calls, and parallel guilt until the final confession reweights everything.

<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias's reckless exploration motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like gripping the flashlight and pocketing the valve. The parallel guilt structure between Elias and the ghost creates meaningful internal conflict. However, the ghost figure's sudden appearance and immediate confession lacks the gradual causality needed for higher scores - this pivotal revelation arrives too conveniently without earned buildup.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias's suppressed guilt about abandoning his brother surfaces in parallel to the ghost's confession, with the beaded valve as physical talisman of "shared folly." Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, and the accumulative structure holds. The cost is felt but the ghost's appearance breaks causality - he materializes without sufficient grounding, and his confession arrives without dramatized pressure, weakening the closure's earned quality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tunnel setting actively constrains movement ("narrowing until the walls seemed to breathe") and the beaded valve wheel functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful - "scent of rust and forgotten coal," walls "warm and clammy." The mill's industrial geography creates authentic pressure through collapsed beams forming "a jagged altar."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake - confronting buried truth - is signaled early and tightens when the valve wheel grows warm and the ghost appears. However, escalation relies heavily on the supernatural encounter rather than Elias's agency. The radio calls build atmospheric pressure effectively, but the resolution arrives through the ghost's unprompted confession rather than Elias's choices narrowing his options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of suppressed industrial guilt emerges organically through concrete details - the valve wheel as "frozen tears," the ghost shift's "endless labor." The parallel structure between Elias's and the ghost's buried truths creates resonance without stating a moral. The final image of the valve wheel as "talisman of shared folly" reweights prior material effectively, though the confession's directness ("I turned that valve wrong") edges toward over-articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature throughout - Elias notices industrial details like "beaded valve wheel" and interprets coincidences through his skeptical lens. Voice modulates effectively from drowsy exploration to sharp alertness when encountering the ghost. The prose maintains distinct texture with phrases like "hesitant thought" and "drowsy alertness," though some constructions feel overwrought ("snaking from the old steelworks mill").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic variety and purposeful compression. However, several overwrought phrases impede momentum: "like a vein pulsing with half-remembered life," "whispering secrets of industrial ghosts." The extended metaphors occasionally strain clarity without adding pressure. Filter-verb clusters appear in emotional peaks ("he felt the pull," "he wondered if") reducing immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The parallel guilt structure between Elias and the ghost worker offers a fresh angle on industrial tragedy narratives. The beaded valve wheel as physical manifestation of suppressed truth is specific and memorable. However, the ghost encounter follows familiar supernatural confession patterns, and the resolution doesn't fully transform the trope despite strong atmospheric work.</comment>
