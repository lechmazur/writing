<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation builds coherently from his decade of solitary work to his core belief that "whispers travel farther than shouts," with his rescue of Marco serving as earned proof. His uncanny ability to identify walks from echoes functions as lived expertise that enables the rescue. Minor deduction for some expository interiority ("turning the labyrinth into his personal archive of gaits") that tells what could be shown through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change: Marco's rescue proves Elias's whisper method superior to shouting, with visible cost in Marco's humiliation and Elias's "calculated spontaneity" paying off. The causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkage from storm disruption to Marco's wager to Elias's rescue. Orientation anchors (port, containers, storm) land within first 120 words. Cost is legible in Marco's dazed state and the power reversal, though could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The labyrinth of containers functions as active constraint—the storm scrambles navigation, metal amplifies whispers, and hidden mechanisms enable rescue. Sensory detail filters through Elias's expertise ("dent and shadow," "ozone," "metal floors"). The zodiac mechanism and folded maps provide specific tools that constrain choice. Minor deduction for some catalog listing ("salt and diesel," "cranes") without fuller POV coloring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving whispers beat shouts) escalates from Elias's internal motivation through Marco's failed wager to the successful rescue. The storm creates time pressure and Marco's panic raises stakes. Agency drives the resolution through Elias's choice to volunteer and his specific rescue method. Missing sharper cost articulation—Marco's humiliation is implied but could land harder.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: subtlety outlasting bombast proven via the rescue rather than stated. The zodiac coin and folded maps embody hidden knowledge versus obvious force. Subtext operates in Elias's "feigned casualness" and calculated movements. Final paragraph edges toward explicit theme statement ("whispers had threaded through the storm") rather than letting the image alone carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with controlled psychic distance and Elias's perceptual signature (identifying walks, knowing "every dent"). Dialogue differentiates Marco's bombast from Elias's quiet confidence. Some filter verb accumulation ("he'd anticipated," "knowing") dulls immediacy in places. Voice maintains consistency through pressure with appropriate modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is solid with most lines advancing multiple story elements. Template cadence appears in the opening ("Elias patrolled...The structures stacked...Elias, the maintenance worker") and some paraphrase loops ("his steps seeming random yet precisely aimed"). Minor scaffold in transitions but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The whispers-versus-shouts dynamic offers a fresh angle on expertise versus bluster. Elias's walk-identification ability and the hidden zodiac mechanisms are specific details that avoid generic maze-rescue territory. The calculated spontaneity concept integrates well but doesn't fully transform the competent-worker-saves-loudmouth template. Setting details like the geomagnetic storm affecting navigation add specificity.</comment>
