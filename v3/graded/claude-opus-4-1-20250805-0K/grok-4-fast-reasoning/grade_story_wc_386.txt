<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to salvage purity from wreckage drives consistent choices through the ritual, with embodied scars and careful spectral weaving showing character under pressure. The resolution where she frees the ghosts by exposing suppressed affections provides earned closure with visible cost. However, internal conflict operates more through description than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and some emotional states remain told rather than embodied ("burned like the candles' flames").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as ghosts are freed through Elara's exposure of hidden truths, with the melted snow globe reforming as tangible proof of reclaimed purity. Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through layered ghost appearances culminating in the revelation about suppressed affections. Orientation anchors clearly (Elara, glacier shrine, wreck-diving role) and causality traces from diving experience through windows method to final release, though the mechanics of how exposure frees ghosts could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glacier shrine setting actively constrains the ritual through its chiseled ice windows that catch aurora glow and refract dreams, making the environment essential to Elara's method. Sensory detail layers borrowed starlight, flickering candles, and ethereal chill to create atmospheric density that supports the spectral work. The melted snow globe's warped sphere and Victorian parlor scene provide specific textural anchors that charge the final transformation when it reforms.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—salvaging purity from wreckage—intensifies as Elara analyzes ghost cameos, building through Lady Franklin's appearance to the midshipman's wonder, culminating in the exposure of suppressed affections as the expedition's fatal flaw. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres through pattern recognition and deepens when the true cause is revealed. However, agency remains primarily observational rather than forcing difficult choices, and the cost of freeing ghosts lacks concrete dramatization beyond the warming shrine.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between imperial duty and human connection, with the melted/reformed snow globe serving as a concrete symbol of purity reclaimed from corruption. The revelation that suppressed affections caused fatal isolation offers complexity without moralizing, and the midshipman sharing stories with Inuit elders provides counter-narrative to colonial hubris. The ending's reformed snowflake resonates as non-literal answer to what can be salvaged from disaster.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric elevation with controlled syntax ("where borrowed starlight filtered through fractured ice like whispers") and selective perception focused on spectral details. The prose texture creates distinct atmosphere through phrases like "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" and "spectral threads," though occasional register elevation ("imperial duty," "fatal isolations") slightly exceeds the mystical-practical hybrid register. POV remains stable with appropriate focalization limits.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong atmospheric density with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in passages like "carved deep into the frozen monolith, the shrine's walls gleamed with veins of blue ice." Information density remains high as most lines advance both atmosphere and plot. However, some metaphorical density borders on overwriting ("burned like the candles' flames") and occasional abstract phrasing ("unspoken bonds that had sustained the crew") could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of analyzing ghost cameos in strangers' dreams offers genuine originality, transforming the ghost-whisperer trope through specific mechanics of windows catching aurora and refracting subconscious visions. The Franklin expedition setting provides historical grounding while the revelation about suppressed affections subverts typical exploration-disaster narratives. The synthesis of wreck-diving, dream analysis, and Arctic mysticism creates memorable specificity.</comment>
