<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's steadfast loyalty and motivation to protect her father drive clear choices, with concrete embodied details like clutching the watch fob. The three false starts show her persistence under pressure with visible costs. However, the "sound of trust breaking" metaphor feels forced and abstract rather than character-specific, and the phonograph conceit strains credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story follows a causal lens with three attempted thwarts building to a partial success. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly by the second paragraph. However, closure lacks decisive change - Elara "slips away" with vague resolution about clearing her father's path, and the cost remains abstract ("comforting unease fading") rather than visible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the rotting pier creates vivid atmosphere through selective sensory detail ("salt and decay," "fish-oil lamps") that shapes Elara's movements and choices. The environment constrains her tactics as she navigates "crates and canvas awnings." The setting actively participates in the action, particularly when she douses the flare in spilled grog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear - preventing rivals from betraying her father - with escalation through three false starts that each fail differently. The final chaotic action with the flare creates some tightening. However, the resolution feels incomplete; we don't see if her actions actually thwarted the trap or saved her father, leaving the dominant stake unresolved.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of loyalty within an outlaw code emerges through action, with the "truce of hush" concept grounding the stakes. However, the abstract "sound of trust breaking" metaphor feels imposed rather than organic. The ending doesn't offer resonant closure to the thematic question - just vague "morning's promise" without earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with period-appropriate diction ("moonshine runner," "doubloons") and Elara's perspective filters descriptions appropriately. Dialogue carries subtext and character distinction. However, some phrases feel overwritten ("comforting unease," "curiously steadfast") and the POV occasionally slips into omniscient summary rather than staying grounded in Elara's immediate experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose artifacts significantly harm momentum: the meta-commentary about word count, the forced "sound of trust breaking" metaphor repeated abstractly, and overwritten phrases like "comforting unease" that appear multiple times. The actual/adjusted word count notation breaks immersion entirely. Some strong sensory writing exists but is undermined by these scaffold elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The pirate market setting and moonshine runner's daughter protagonist offer fresh texture, and the three false starts structure provides originality. However, the abstract "capturing sound" conceit feels gimmicky rather than organic, and the resolution retreats to safety with vague "morning's promise" rather than committing to consequences.</comment>
