<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by her desire to free prophecies from fate's grip and offer choices. The final act of sharing the decoded prophecy with villages demonstrates earned change with visible cost (years of patient work). However, interiority relies on abstract concepts ("spin rigid prophecies," "raw possibilities") rather than embodied emotion, and no genuine internal contradiction acts simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based escalation through button cataloging that builds toward the prophecy's unscrambling. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara transforms the fixed prophecy into interpretable branches ("choose not the foretold, but the alive") and shares it with villages. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, but the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The amber warehouse setting constrains and enables key choices—the buttons are scattered throughout, the jar sits on a specific pedestal, and the physical arrangement shapes Elara's cataloging work at the oak table. Sensory details (amber scent, dust motes, cliff groans) are selective and atmospheric. The micro-setting of buttons as amber-encased relics directly charges the final unscrambling sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (freeing prophecy from predestination) is signaled early and deepens as Elara's button cataloging reveals the echo's true message. The tightening occurs when "shadows lengthened and the cliffs outside groaned," creating temporal pressure. However, no genuine opposition tests Elara's resolve—the unscrambling proceeds smoothly without reversal or meaningful cost beyond time investment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of buttons as "small decisions that wove into larger fates." The final revelation that wisdom should be "disseminated like echoes across canyons" resonates without explicit moralizing. The prophecy's transformation from fixed fate to "branches" offers a non-literal answer to questions of determinism versus choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with controlled rhythm ("moved like a shadow," "sand's fall," "ebb of truths"). The perceptual signature focuses on temporal markers and amber-specific details. However, some passages drift into elevated register beyond Elara's established lexicon ("minutiae," "foretelling"), and syntactic patterns occasionally become repetitive in their parallel constructions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements simultaneously. However, abstract phrasing ("raw possibilities," "unearthed silence") appears frequently without concrete embodiment, and some metaphoric vehicles strain coherence (buttons as both "threads" and "mosaic").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of cataloging lost buttons to decode prophecy offers genuine originality, transforming the familiar chosen-one-with-prophecy trope through specific material culture. The synthesis of amber preservation, temporal measurement, and small choices creating fate feels earned. Yet the resolution's philosophical stance on free will versus determinism lands in familiar territory without pushing beyond expected insights.</comment>
