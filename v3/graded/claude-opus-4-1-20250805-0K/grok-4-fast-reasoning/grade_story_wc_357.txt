<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her discovery choice feels earned, but her internal experience remains somewhat generic during the inversion sequence. The final pocketing of the arrow tip shows agency with implied responsibility, though the emotional cost of this discovery could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Causal lens with discovery as the decisive change, and the arrow tip revelation provides legitimate closure with implied cost (responsibility to safeguard). However, the cost remains more conceptual than felt—we don't see Elara grapple with the weight of her discovery or what safeguarding means for her specifically.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating arches and inverted gravity create genuine spatial constraints that shape navigation choices, particularly the anchor deployment and vortex entry. The "whirling silence" and "gathering echoes" work as atmospheric elements that guide discovery, making the environment actively pressure choices rather than mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gravity inversion creates a ticking clock that forces immediate anchor deployment, and the echoes drawing Elara deeper provide meaningful escalation. The discovery of the arrow tip and its revelation about the planet's resilience lands with clarity, though the personal cost to Elara could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of resilience emerges naturally through the discovery of ancient pilots who seeded survival into Arboris's DNA. The arrow tip as source of "enduring vitality" resonates without preaching, though the final line about safeguarding could dig deeper into what this responsibility means rather than stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong technical vocabulary ("inversion anchors," "magnetic tethers") and consistent third-limited POV create professional competence. The perceptual signature during inversion—rivers flowing like "upside-down waterfalls"—shows controlled focalization, though Elara's voice could be more distinctive in quieter moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive prose with good momentum through the inversion sequence. Some mild redundancy ("whirling silence" appears four times) and occasional overwriting ("auditory ghosts, revealing paths obscured"), but information density remains high and the action choreography tracks clearly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The gravity inversion mechanic and the concept of orchards thriving through ancient crash-seeding offers a fresh take on planetary colonization. The "gathering echoes" as navigation tool shows originality, though the final revelation follows somewhat predictable ancient-artifact patterns.</comment>
