<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Jack's internal wrestling between holding onto and discarding the speaker cloth shows genuine contradictory impulses, and his shift from "bitter mantra" to "motivational hum" earns a credible stance change. However, the resolution feels slightly neat—his epiphany about "quiet sifting after" arrives through reflection rather than dramatized pressure, and the final paragraph's "longing softening into resolve" smooths over complexity without sufficient cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Jack's emotional state deepening through layered reflections, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where he reframes his purpose. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual—"tomorrow, he'd return to appraising" lacks the immediate, felt price that would elevate the closure, and the shift from despair to resolve happens through interior realization rather than dramatized choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The quarry setting effectively mirrors Jack's emotional excavation, particularly in "vast pits swallowing the late afternoon sun" and the final image of the quarry as "vast archive." The speaker cloth functions as micro-setting that constrains his choice to let go. However, the trailer remains generic beyond "scarred desk" and "fluorescent buzz," missing opportunities for specificity that would heighten the moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Jack's search for purpose after loss—is clear, and his wrestling with the speaker cloth provides one meaningful tightening moment. However, escalation remains largely internal through reflection rather than rising pressure, and the resolution ("tomorrow, he'd return to appraising") lacks immediate cost or foreclosed options that would sharpen the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme of finding meaning "after the applause" emerges organically through Jack's transition from roadie chaos to appraiser's precision, with the quarry-as-archive providing resonant imagery. However, the insight that "purpose wasn't in the spotlight's glare but in the quiet sifting after" arrives as explicit realization rather than earned through dramatized struggle, slightly weakening thematic integration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent melancholic texture with effective rhythm variation ("Jack walked toward the pits, the longing softening into resolve") and character-specific perception filters like "faint metallic tang" and "acoustic weave." The prose successfully modulates between longer reflective passages and shorter declarative moments, though some phrases like "hollow ache in his chest" lean toward stock imagery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm shifts and strong opening/closing images. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "vast archive, waiting for someone to listen to its stories" strains the metaphor, and phrases like "faltering pulse" and "tactile promise" push toward purple prose. The reflection-to-action ratio also creates some momentum drag in the middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The roadie-to-appraiser arc offers a specific angle on loss and reinvention, and the quarry setting as emotional landscape shows some originality. However, the resolution follows a familiar template of finding-purpose-through-acceptance, and the extended metaphor of excavation/archaeology for emotional work, while competent, doesn't transcend its conceptual obviousness.</comment>
