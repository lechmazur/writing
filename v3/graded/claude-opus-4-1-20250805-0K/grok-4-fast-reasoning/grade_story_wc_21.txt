<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover truth is clear and consistent, driving her actions from archive to lagoon. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("solemn face etched with weight") rather than embodied contradiction, and the spectral informant negotiation lacks concrete character-specific choices that would elevate the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the diary's revelation "freeing her from the trap," but cost remains abstract ("renewed purpose skyward") rather than visible. The retrocognitive trap mechanism creates causal linkage, yet the resolution through beach debris arrangement feels mechanically convenient rather than earned through prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and dunes create atmospheric setting that participates in closure, with the lagoon functioning as both physical location and metaphorical "secret wound." However, spatial choreography becomes unclear during the vision sequences, and the zeppelin library remains static decoration rather than constraining choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stakes center on uncovering civil rights violations, with the retrocognitive trap providing pressure. Yet escalation remains largely internal through visions rather than present-scene choices, and the "parley with spectral informant" resolution lacks concrete opposition that would create genuine tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Theme of suppressed truth emerges through the activist's story and Elara's parallel journey, with the obsidian lagoon serving as metaphor for hidden knowledge. But the ending's "mending the fractured archive one searing truth at a time" states theme directly rather than letting it emerge from the final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register with phrases like "searing reverie" and "fractured coasts," though this creates distance from Elara's immediate experience. The prose sustains atmospheric tone but lacks distinctive perceptual signature—Elara as archivist doesn't filter observations differently than generic literary narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Dense figurative language appears in most sentences ("labyrinth of leather-bound tomes," "invisible current," "spring in her chest") without payoff, creating overwriting that obscures action. Template phrases like "her life a archive of forgotten injustices" and repetitive "searing" descriptors indicate scaffold, while the rushed ending adjustment ("Wait, that's over—adjusting for count") breaks narrative immersion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The retrocognitive trap concept offers fresh angle on historical investigation, and the obsidian lagoon as repository for forbidden knowledge shows imaginative worldbuilding. However, execution relies on familiar activist-uncovering-conspiracy beats, and the beach debris communication method feels arbitrary rather than emerging from established logic.</comment>
