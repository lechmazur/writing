<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong characterization with clear internal contradiction between protection and deception. Elias's guilt is well-embodied ("guilt gnawed at him, a relentless tide") and his decision to tell the truth feels earned by accumulated pressure. Minor slip toward label-speak in places but generally avoids therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Solid accumulative structure with clear closure in Elias's decision to tell Eliza the truth. Good orientation and the watch hand discovery provides effective escalation. The cost of ending his protective lie is felt, though could be more viscerally present on the page. Causality holds under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Excellent atmospheric specificity with the cobalt terrace, forgotten shore, and driftwood carvings creating vivid sense of place. The watch hand embedded in weathered wood provides strong tactile detail that constrains his final choice. The "sieved hush" creates distinctive sensory texture that supports the contemplative mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear dominant stake in whether to reveal the truth to Eliza. Internal pressure escalates well through the ritual sequence, and the resolution provides meaningful closure. The decision feels more like realization than hard choice under pressure, limiting the sense of visible cost at the climactic moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong thematic integration around truth versus protection, with his false memory profession creating effective resonance. The watch hand and driftwood symbols work purposefully without heavy-handedness. The ending offers resolution to the central question through image rather than statement, avoiding explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited with good perceptual signature in how Elias notices details. The lyrical register fits the contemplative mode well. Some elevation in diction ("tempered regret," "sieved hush") occasionally feels slightly forced but generally serves the literary voice effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with effective imagery and rhythm. Good metaphorical work in opening lines. Some repetitive phrasing around "sieved hush" and minor template cadence in sentence structures. A few instances of slight overwriting that don't quite reach artifact level but create small momentum drags.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The black market genealogist profession provides distinctive premise, and the driftwood ritual creates interesting synthesis. Good emotional specificity and thematic resonance between his work and personal deception. Some risk-taking in lyrical approach pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
