<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong characterization with clear internal conflict between Elara's pacifist nature and her violent inheritance. Her motivations are consistent and drive meaningful choices, particularly the symbolic decision to sheath rather than wield the knife. Some interiority veers toward abstract philosophizing, and emotional states could be more embodied, but the character arc culminates in an earned stance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Solid accumulative structure building to the dome crack crisis with clear closure through Earned Stasis. Elara's refusal of violence and persistence with her pacifist method results in the dome's stabilization, with the cost of her solitary commitment legible on the page. Causality holds under the accumulative lens, though some transitions between backstory and present action feel loose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm is vividly realized and integral to the story's logic. Sensory details create immersive atmosphere, and the dome provides meaningful constraint that shapes choices. The post-apocalyptic setting emerges efficiently through specific details like airship debris and the fallen tower, grounding the story in a lived-in world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear dominant stake in preserving the sanctuary against chaos, with effective escalation through the dome crack that tests Elara's method under pressure. The resolution through cultivated calm rather than force works under the accumulative lens, though the mechanics feel slightly abstract. Cost is visible in her committed solitude.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing versus violence emerges organically through concrete imagery and action rather than statement. The contrast between Elara's "engraved quiet" and her father's legacy creates meaningful tension. The final image of roses blooming as "beacons against the endless night" offers resonant closure without moralizing, though some language veers toward the abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive lyrical voice that modulates appropriately with pressure. The elevated, metaphorical diction creates a coherent narrative texture. However, the register occasionally feels too literary for the character and situation, with phrases like "tranquil blaze" and "senseless perception" bordering on purple prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clear and rhythmically varied prose with sophisticated imagery. However, dense figurative language in most sentences creates overwriting, particularly with repeated abstract phrases like "tranquil blaze" and "engraved quiet." Some register drift toward overly literary diction in high-pressure beats reduces immediacy and threatens to obscure the concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of "inculcating plants with values" and the specific post-apocalyptic details create freshness. The pacifist daughter trope is transformed through the particular setting and her unique method. While the post-apocalyptic frame feels familiar, the desert rose farm and glass dome sanctuary provide a distinctive angle that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
