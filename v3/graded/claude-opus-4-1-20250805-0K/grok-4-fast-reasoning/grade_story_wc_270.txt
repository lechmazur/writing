<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's insurgent identity and plant telepathy drive genuine choices with cost, particularly her decision to unseal the embryo despite tradition's warnings. The motivation is clear and consistent, though internal contradiction could be more embodied in scene rather than summarized ("Her insurgent spirit flared"). The final choice to carry the embryo back shows earned agency with visible stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the embryo's discovery and unsealing. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the embryo's awakening reweights the reconstruction from physical to spiritual/societal rebirth with visible cost (shattering tradition). Orientation anchors early (volcanic hot springs, reconstruction, Elder Mira), and causality holds through plant-guided discovery to deliberate unsealing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs and geothermal environment actively shape Mira's discovery path through "treacherous fissures" and provide the amber-preserving heat. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (sulfurous mists, hissing steam, bubbling waters). The setting constrains movement and enables the embryo's preservation, directly charging the final image of earth's fury yielding to rebirth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—evolving tradition versus ossification—escalates from peripheral observation to active unsealing with clear cost (defying hierarchies). Mira's agency drives the discovery and choice to break the seal. The tightening occurs when she must decode the script and physically shatter the amber, foreclosing the path of traditional compliance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of intentional evolution versus petrified tradition emerges through concrete action (unsealing) rather than assertion. The embryo as "implanted destiny" carries subtext about co-creation versus imposed fate. However, some thematic statements edge toward the explicit ("ensuring destiny was not imposed but co-created"), and the final paragraph contains mild moralizing that could trust the dramatization more.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains consistent focalization through Mira with controlled psychic distance. The plant telepathy creates a distinct perceptual signature ("verdant murmurs," "leafy voices"). Some register drift occurs in peak moments ("bio-engineered seed from pre-cataclysm scientists") that doesn't fully match Mira's insurgent grandmother voice, and occasional filter constructions dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance plot or atmosphere. However, some paraphrase loops appear ("Her rebellion, once armed with fire, now bloomed with purpose" restates the transformation), and template phrases like "Heart pounding" and "Eyes narrowed" lack specificity. The closing contains mild scaffold with abstract summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of ecological rebellion, plant telepathy, and bio-engineered destiny offers a non-obvious angle on post-disaster reconstruction. The specific detail of decoding script from a kite's tail to find amber-preserved embryo shows genuine invention. While the eco-spiritual transformation theme isn't entirely fresh, the particular combination of insurgent elder and verdant telepathy creates memorable texture.</comment>
