I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her internal journey from self-forgiveness to preservation drives concrete choices. However, her emotional progression feels too smooth—the "snowmelt ardor" never truly conflicts with doubt or difficulty, and her expertise makes the rope reconfiguration feel predetermined rather than struggled for.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where preserved names echo through the sanctum. However, the cost remains abstract—we're told about "forgiveness complete" and transformation, but the actual price of this preservation ritual never manifests concretely on the page. The orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum under aurora creates atmosphere and the rope becomes a constraining tool for the ritual. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than active pressure—the "ancient chill" and "melting ice" don't meaningfully complicate Elara's actions or force difficult choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving forgotten names) is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or complication. The rope reconfiguration proceeds without setback, the card slots in perfectly, and the names emerge as planned—no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of preservation versus loss emerges through the lost wax casting metaphor and the names' recovery. However, the ending's "echo of those names within her" reads as explicit thematic summary rather than earned resonance, and the forgiveness arc resolves too neatly without exploring the complexity of self-blame.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistent elevated register with controlled syntax ("aurora-veiled night," "snowmelt ardor") that suits the mythic tone. The POV remains stable with clean focalization, though the perceptual signature could be more distinctive—Elara notices like a generic artisan rather than this specific lost wax caster.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates variety in sentence structure and some evocative imagery ("rope stirred, its braids undulating like waves"). However, several passages contain unnecessary scaffold ("She had come here, drawn by legends") and the text occasionally over-explains what's already shown ("now a bridge between past and present").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The combination of lost wax casting with memory preservation through punched cards offers an interesting synthesis. However, the execution feels safe—the ritual proceeds exactly as intended, the forgiveness arc follows predictable beats, and the ending chooses the median option of complete healing without genuine ambiguity.</comment>
