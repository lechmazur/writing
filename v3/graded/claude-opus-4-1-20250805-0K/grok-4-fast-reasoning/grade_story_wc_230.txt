<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to cultivate psychological safety through gentle deceptions creates genuine internal contradiction against his involuntary truthfulness curse, earning the story's central tension. The glass eye implantation represents a credible, earned choice with visible physical cost ("Pain bloomed like a hidden fungus"). However, the emotional progression feels slightly rushed in the final paragraph, and the community members remain abstract rather than embodied presences applying pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure through the glass eye's transformation from buried relic to implanted solution, with clear cost paid through self-surgery. The pattern of truth-telling established early pays off when Elias gains "measured words" to foster psychological safety. Minor orientation delay (who/where anchors arrive late in paragraph one) costs −0.3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hanging orchard suspended over a storm-tossed ravine creates vivid spatial pressure and constrains Elias's movements throughout. The glass eye discovery emerges naturally from truffle foraging in "rain-soaked earth." Strong sensory work ("earthy bloom of truffles," "thunder cracked the bruised sky") though the makeshift shelter and community locations remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—creating psychological safety despite involuntary truthfulness—escalates through discovery, research, and self-surgery with clear cost. The glass eye solution emerges causally from foraging and textbook research. However, the community's collapse remains largely told rather than shown through specific pressure, limiting the felt urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of necessary deception versus brutal honesty emerges organically through Elias's condition and the empathy virus context. The glass eye becomes a resonant symbol of "merciful shadows" and selective blindness. The final image of "mended hearts" in the ravine effectively reweights the opening's isolation, though some thematic statements feel slightly over-explicit ("veils, gentle occlusions").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person POV with distinctive voice combining scientific precision ("mycelial networks with a compass") and poetic register ("fractured the sky's grace"). The involuntary truth-telling creates natural voice tension. Some register elevation feels unmotivated ("occluding the dim light") and dialogue is entirely absent, preventing full voice range assessment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("gnarled sentinels suspended on terraced ledges") but several overwrought passages strain clarity. Template repetition appears ("Elias murmured...," "Elias prepared...," "Elias spoke...") costing −0.4. The verb "occlude" appears five times, creating noticeable repetition. Some metaphors feel forced ("Pain bloomed like a hidden fungus").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The empathy virus creating involuntary truthfulness offers a fresh pandemic metaphor with specific lived consequences. The glass eye as prosthetic solution to emotional overexposure shows originality. However, the "rational forager dismisses superstition" setup feels somewhat templated, and the community-in-crisis backdrop lacks distinctive texture.</comment>
