I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant with Causal elements). The story builds through layered imagery and ritual action toward a resonant reconfiguration where names are preserved through light.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through "snowmelt ardor" and physical trembling. The transformation from guilt to purpose drives credible choices. Internal conflict between past failure and present determination creates authentic tension, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("driven by a purpose that had burned within her").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands with visible cost - Elara commits to staying as keeper. The hybrid lens holds as accumulative imagery (aurora, ice, light) builds toward causal action (reconfiguring rope). Orientation anchors effectively by line 3, though the transition from past guilt to present action could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum constrains choices through cold and sacred protocols. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful - "aurora painting frozen walls," "frigid air bit at her cheeks." The rope's "strange internal light" and ice channels create a lived-in magical system that directly enables the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal pilgrimage to preserving all names. The reconfiguration sequence creates genuine tension through "technically gentle" precision required. Cost is visible - Elara sacrifices her freedom to become keeper, though the middle could use more immediate pressure before the rope work begins.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of preservation versus abstract guilt. The final image of Elara preparing to work "until her own name was transcribed" offers a resonant answer about memory and sacrifice. The organ card fragment as key to unlocking lost names avoids heavy-handed symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register appropriate to the sacred setting. "Snowmelt ardor" and "technically gentle" create distinctive texture. POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance, though some passages drift toward elevated diction ("ethereal blues and greens") that slightly exceeds Elara's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm, particularly strong in the rope sequence. Some overwriting appears - "ethereal blues and greens," "ceremonial rope, centuries old" could be tighter. Information density is generally good with lines doing multiple jobs, though "transcribed in light, preserved at last" contains mild redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost wax casting skill with name preservation offers a fresh angle. The "technically gentle" touch required for sacred work transforms a craft detail into spiritual practice. The organ card as memory key is inventive, though the magical realism elements (descending aurora, crystallizing names) lean somewhat familiar.</comment>
