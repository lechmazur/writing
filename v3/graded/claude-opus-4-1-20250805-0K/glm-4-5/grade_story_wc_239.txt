<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The witness's motivation to "unify scattered cosmic fragments" and "unravel cosmic illusions" is clearly stated but lacks embodied emotional stakes or internal contradiction. The character functions more as a conceptual vehicle than a person with genuine struggle—their translucent form literalizes this abstraction problem. No concrete cost appears in their choices; they simply execute their cosmic task without visible personal price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the witness gathering cosmic truths, but closure lacks visible cost—the final unification happens without sacrifice or trade-off, just completion. The "resounding hush of completion" attempts resonance but feels unearned without dramatized struggle. Orientation remains vague throughout (who is this witness, what destroyed the universe), violating the 120-word anchor rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The library setting with "towering shelves" and the softcover dictionary as micro-setting work adequately, with the dictionary's pages revealing "doorways" that enable the witness's journey. The "stone altar" provides a concrete anchor for the climax. However, the setting remains largely static backdrop rather than active constraint on choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract throughout—"unify scattered cosmic fragments" and "balance cosmic powers" never translate into concrete pressure with visible cost. The universe's hiccup creates theoretical urgency but no dramatized tension as the witness simply walks, reads, and succeeds. No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; the journey proceeds without opposition or genuine choice between competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of unity versus separation emerges through the concept of "spiral arbitration" reconciling opposites, but relies heavily on abstract declaration rather than dramatized particulars. The dictionary commanding "Unify" and the final merger feel prescribed rather than earned through scene work. The story tells us about cosmic illusions of separateness without showing their concrete effects.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The elevated register maintains consistency but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—any cosmic observer could narrate this. Phrases like "liminal space between endings and beginnings" and "threads of light older than time" read as generic mystical prose without character-specific voice. The POV remains stable but impersonal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades with phrases like "monumental location that contained the memories of civilizations yet unborn" and "pure consciousness suspended in infinite potential and absolute determination." Template mystical diction ("ancient temple," "forgotten knowledge," "cosmic understanding") replaces specificity. The prose tells about paradoxes ("journeying inward while walking out") without dramatizing them through concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The cosmic library witness gathering fragments to heal universal separation follows extremely familiar mystical fiction templates without transformation through specific detail. The "softcover dictionary" as mystical guide and the stone altar climax are stock elements. No surprising turn or fresh angle emerges from the predictable completion arc.</comment>
