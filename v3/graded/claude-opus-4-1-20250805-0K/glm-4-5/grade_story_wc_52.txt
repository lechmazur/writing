<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clara's grief-driven carving shows strong internal contradiction between preservation and release, with embodied emotion through tactile wood-working. The "hauntingly practical" trait manifests concretely in measuring distances and transforming loss into creation. Minor deduction for the Chinese character typo ("指纹") breaking immersion and slight over-articulation in the final paragraph's emotional summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently with density increase through layered memories and the kettle's temporal frame. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Clara's acceptance of simultaneous presence/absence, with visible cost in the "rust-hued peace." The orientation anchors clearly (loft, afternoon, Clara alone). Deduction for some causality softness in the middle sections where reflection dominates action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight functions as micro-setting that constrains and shapes Clara's emotional state, with light patterns evolving from "fractured" to "constellations." Sensory detail effectively filtered through grief-lens (seeing circus tents in rain angles). The loft's "rust-hued peace" and unchanged-yet-different paradox grounds the emotional terrain. Strong spatial coherence throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on Clara's need to transform grief into creation, with the kettle's boiling time creating natural pressure. The carving progresses from tentative to confident cuts, showing agency through artistic choice. Cost is visible in the "specific shape" of absence becoming presence. Limited by lack of external complication or meaningful reversal, appropriate for accumulative design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "here and gone" and "holding differently" rather than letting go. The lion carving's transformation from snarling to serene embodies thematic evolution. Strong subtext in the "menagerie of loss." Minor deduction for slight over-articulation in "harvesting lessons from loss" which edges toward thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elegiac tone with controlled rhythm matching Clara's measured grief-work. Strong perceptual signature in how she notices time and transforms observations into circus memories. The POV remains stable and modest. Deduction for occasional register elevation ("crystallized time," "rust-hued peace") that slightly exceeds the character's established lexicon during emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. However, multiple paraphrase loops damage momentum: "here and gone"/"here and gone simultaneously," "crystallized time"/"crystallized moments"/"crystallized pocket," and the kettle's progress described redundantly. The Chinese character typo and some overwriting in figurative language ("each droplet a tiny prism") further reduce the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The specific synthesis of lion-tamer's widow finding peace through carving offers fresh angle on grief narrative. "Hauntingly practical" as character trait and the kettle-as-timer device show originality. However, the grief-through-art premise and "holding differently" resolution trend toward familiar territory without sufficient transformation to reach higher bands.</comment>
