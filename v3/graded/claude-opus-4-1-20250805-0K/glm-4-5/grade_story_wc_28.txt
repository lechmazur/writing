<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—rebuilding through empathy—but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the score. The "retrocognitively trapped" attribute generates some internal tension between past and present, yet his choices feel predetermined rather than conflicted. His final act of renaming carries emotional weight but arrives without sufficient prior struggle between competing desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the renaming ritual that transforms the plaza from ruins to "potential," with visible communal witness as cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and memories build toward the climactic naming. However, the transformation feels somewhat abstract—"the plaza respond to his words"—without concrete physical or relational change that would strengthen causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ancient plaza with its "cracked stones," "broken archways," and embedded mosaic functions as more than backdrop—it constrains Elias's ritual to a specific location and provides the tessera that triggers action. Sensory details effectively filter through his retrocognitive perception. The setting directly enables the final ritual through the mosaic stepping stone, though some descriptions edge toward the generic ("silence and ash").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming identity through naming—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Escalation occurs through the accumulation of memories and the gathering of witnesses, building to the naming ritual. However, the conflict lacks concrete opposition or cost; Elias faces no meaningful resistance to his action, and the transformation occurs without visible sacrifice or trade-off beyond abstract "revolutionary kindness."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of renewal through "aberrant mercy" emerges organically from Elias's actions rather than declaration, particularly in the paradox of "warm coldness" and finding beauty in destruction. The final image of the brightened mosaic offers a non-literal answer about persistence through catastrophe. However, phrases like "We are not the fire. We are what rises from the ashes" edge toward explicit moralizing that weakens the otherwise implicit thematic work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and filters perception through Elias's retrocognitive consciousness, creating a distinct texture of overlaid time. Diction appropriately elevates for the ritualistic tone while remaining accessible. The brief dialogue feels slightly stiff ("We are not the fire") but serves its thematic purpose. Some phrases like "aberrant mercy" feel more authorial than character-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("shattered sky," "cathedral ceiling open to stars") but suffers from repetitive constructions and abstract phrasing. Multiple sentences begin with "Elias" or "His," creating monotonous rhythm. Phrases like "revolutionary kindness" and "aberrant mercy" repeat without variation. The text occasionally tells what could be shown, particularly in describing the plaza's response to the naming.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of healing through naming offers a fresh angle on post-catastrophe narratives, avoiding typical revenge or rebuilding plots. The "retrocognitively trapped" perspective provides an original lens for experiencing ruins. However, the transformation mechanism—speaking a name that somehow changes reality—lacks specificity, and the resolution feels somewhat safe in its universal hope without confronting harder edges of loss.</comment>
