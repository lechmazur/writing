<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Father Michael's motivation to honor Thomas Grant's last request is clear and consistent, with the clockwork heart serving as a physical manifestation of his moral burden. The internal conflict between spending his savings on the repair versus buying the house for Grant's ex-wife creates genuine tension. However, the revelation about the house purchase feels slightly abrupt without sufficient groundwork, and the secondary character Eleanor lacks pressure beyond professional assessment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Father Michael's decision to leave the heart broken as testament to ongoing work, with visible cost in his retirement savings spent on the house. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details about the heart, the shop, and the priest's ministry cohere toward this final stance. The orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and causality tracks cleanly through the reveal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The music box repair shop creates atmospheric pressure with "soft ticking of unseen mechanisms" and filtered afternoon light through stained glass. The clockwork heart's physical details—"miniature clockwork heart with its intricate gears and counterfeit veins of copper wire"—are vivid and specific. However, the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain choices or enable tactics beyond providing a space for reflection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to repair the heart or redirect resources toward restitution—emerges clearly and tightens when Father Michael reveals he's already bought the house. The cost is explicit in spending his "entire savings" and the emotional weight of carrying Grant's message. However, Eleanor's presence doesn't create active opposition, limiting the pressure to internal deliberation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of broken things serving as motivation rather than needing repair emerges organically through the heart metaphor and culminates in Eleanor's insight: "Sometimes broken things should remain broken. They remind us of the work we still have to do." The story resists tidy resolution, embracing the complexity of justice versus forgiveness without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent limited third-person with appropriate psychic distance, and Father Michael's clerical background colors his perception ("penitentiary chaplain," "ministry," "repenting"). Dialogue between Michael and Eleanor feels natural with appropriate subtext. Some filter phrases like "he realized what he must do" could be more immediate, but overall the voice serves the contemplative tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong specific imagery ("counterfeit veins of copper wire," "vibrant hush"). Sentence variety creates appropriate rhythm, particularly in the atmospheric opening. Minor redundancies appear ("broke through storm clouds...filtering through") and some telling intrudes ("understanding dawning in her eyes"), but these don't touch the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The clockwork heart as metaphor for redemption offers a fresh angle on the chaplain-prisoner dynamic, and the twist that it stops working when justice is served adds conceptual depth. The specific detail of Grant being a murderer who crafted delicate clockwork adds authentic complexity. However, the repair shop framing follows familiar patterns without significant transformation.</comment>
