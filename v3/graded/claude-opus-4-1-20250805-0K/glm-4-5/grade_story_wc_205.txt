<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to reimagine civilization through poetic interpretation is clear and consistent, driving his actions from examining the shard to writing the manuscript. The internal conflict between his revolutionary past and new approach creates genuine tension. However, the transformation feels somewhat rushed in the final gathering, and secondary characters lack distinct presence beyond functional roles.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the archaeological dispute transforms from binary opposition into "a constellation of possibilities," with visible cost in the "burnished sorrow of their shared history." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details about time visibility, mirror-covering, and the crystal shard build toward the final synthesis. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting with visible time creates genuine constraints—the temporal storm forces Elias to cover mirrors and provides the deadline for his plan. Vivid details like "golden dust motes" of visible time and "shimmering curtains of rippling moments" make the world tangible. The setting directly shapes the final image where "time flowing visibly around them" enables their new understanding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—bridging a violent dispute through reimagined narrative—is clear from "For weeks, Elias had struggled to devise a way." The temporal storm provides meaningful escalation by forcing Elias to act. However, the resolution lacks concrete opposition or cost; the representatives accept his manuscript with "growing astonishment" too easily.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of the shattered vase reflecting "beauty in their fragments," paralleling civilization's capacity to "break and reshape themselves." The ending offers a non-literal answer about truth as "a constellation of possibilities" without moralizing. The concept of reimagining history through poetic interpretation deepens through concrete action rather than abstract statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "ornate labyrinth" and "burnished sorrow," matching Elias's poetic inclination. Perceptual signature shows in how he sees the shard "not as mere archaeological evidence but as a vessel of stories." Some register drift occurs with academic phrasing like "archaeological dispute" and "poetic interpretation" that occasionally distances from scene immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong moments like "Time became visible, each second now a tangible thing that floated through the air like golden dust motes." However, template cadence appears in repetitive "Elias had" constructions, and some paraphrase loops occur ("defunct revolutionary"/"revolutionary flame"). The final paragraph contains mild synonym churn with "reimagined civilization" echoing earlier phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of visible time as tangible dust motes offers genuine freshness, as does the specific response to temporal storms by covering mirrors. The transformation of archaeological dispute through poetic synthesis rather than factual resolution provides a non-obvious angle. The synthesis of revolution-through-reimagination rather than destruction shows originality in character arc.</comment>
