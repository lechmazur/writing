I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered details about the labyrinth's acoustic properties, Marlo's specialized knowledge, and the storm's interference, culminating in a demonstration that reweights the premise about whispers versus shouts.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marlo's motivation is clear and rooted in his expertise, with concrete embodied details like fingers brushing the zodiac coin. The challenge to Vance feels earned through established competence, though the internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene - we see confidence without genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Marlo's whispered directions accomplish what Vance's shouts cannot, with visible cost in Vance's renewed curiosity. However, the stakes feel modest - proving a point about communication methods lacks the weight needed for higher scores, and the "who/where/when" anchoring arrives late (not fully clear until "9:30 PM").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting actively constrains choices through its acoustic properties and shifting configurations. Sensory details like "metal structures to hum with an eerie resonance" and the navigation through "acoustic highways" make the environment essential to the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The central conflict - proving whispers outperform shouts - escalates through Marlo's calculated positioning and timing. The geomagnetic storm adds coherent pressure, but the stakes remain relatively low (workplace dynamics) and lack a meaningful tightening that forecloses options with real cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically through the contrast between Marlo's quiet expertise and Vance's loud authority. The zodiac coin and folded maps accumulate meaning, and the ending offers a resonant answer about different forms of power, though it doesn't quite achieve the complexity needed for higher scores.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistency with Marlo's perspective, using specific perceptual signatures like his ability to identify walks. Dialogue between Marlo and Vance feels natural with appropriate subtext, though the narrative occasionally drifts into slight overwriting ("arcane ritual").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose shows competent variety in sentence structure and maintains momentum, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("towering labyrinth," "eerie resonance," "arcane ritual"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("whispered instructions" followed by explaining the whisper technique), and figurative density in places dulls precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise of acoustic properties in a shipping container maze offers genuine freshness, and the specific detail about whispers traveling through metal channels transforms a familiar David-versus-Goliath workplace dynamic. The synthesis of technical knowledge with interpersonal conflict feels organic and earned.</comment>
