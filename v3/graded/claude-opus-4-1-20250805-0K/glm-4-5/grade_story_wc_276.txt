<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The fisher's motivation is clear and his unique ability to "transliterate emotions" drives the central action, but internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied. The character demonstrates patience and skill but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—his cool-headedness never wavers against competing desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration when the fisher captures the goddess's echo, with cost visible in the transformation of both fisher and cosmos ("transformed by its sacred purpose"). However, the accumulative/textural lens relies heavily on abstract concepts rather than concrete pressure, and the "timeframe when patterns broke themselves" lacks specific temporal anchoring that would heighten stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden creates a vivid, constraining environment where "whispers bloomed into visible ripples" and the fisher must navigate "unstable terrain." The setting directly shapes tactics through the need to create "pockets of quiet amid the overwhelming resonance," though some descriptions lean abstract rather than physically grounded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Escalation occurs through the accumulation of woven emotions and the goddess's eventual descent, but lacks concrete opposition or meaningful tightening. The fisher's agency drives the capture, yet no competing force or internal struggle creates genuine pressure—the task unfolds without visible risk or trade-off until the abstract transformation at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "voicing silence" and the desire "to touch something beyond oneself," avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the garden "humming with the remnant of his success" offers resonant closure, though the abstract nature of divine encounter prevents deeper emotional specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent mythic register with controlled rhythm, but lacks a distinct perceptual signature specific to the fisher's consciousness. Narrative distance remains too uniform—we never feel the texture of his particular mind under pressure, only the elevated narrative voice describing his actions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose suffers from abstract density and repetitive phrasing: "sleepwalking constellations" appears four times, multiple sentences begin with "The fisher" or "He," and abstract concepts like "beautiful dissolution" and "divine resonance" replace concrete imagery. The template cadence "He worked by... Each movement was... Each silent utterance..." creates mechanical rhythm that dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The concept of catching divine echoes through transliterated emotions offers originality, and "voicing silence" provides a fresh paradox. However, execution relies on familiar mythic archetypes without sufficient transformation through specific lived detail—the fisher remains more symbol than individual.</comment>
