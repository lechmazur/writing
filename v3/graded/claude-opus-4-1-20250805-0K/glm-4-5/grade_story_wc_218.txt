I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered discoveries and systematic work toward a resonant transformation, with density increase and pattern culmination at closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his diagnosis, driving systematic work with copper wire despite physical deterioration. His "brazen calm" manifests consistently through action. Minor deduction for somewhat abstract internal states ("weight of mortality settled differently") that could be more embodied, and the transformation feels slightly convenient without deeper internal contradiction shown in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure building from diagnosis through discovery to transformation, with clear closure showing Elias's death as the completion of interspecies connection. The cost is visible - his life exchanged for the bridge between worlds. Minor deduction for some causality softness in how quickly he masters the complex copper wire patterns and the somewhat convenient timing of completion at exactly six months.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The living stone pillars and temple orchard create a vivid, specific setting that constrains and enables Elias's work - the copper wire must be wrapped in precise patterns matching constellations. Strong integration of setting with action. Deduction for occasional vagueness ("otherworldly iridescence," "energy he could almost see") and missed opportunities for more tactile detail during the wire-wrapping work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake - completing the interspecies bridge before death - drives consistent escalation through physical deterioration and increasing complexity of the work. The tightening occurs through his weakening body against the demanding task. Deduction for lack of concrete obstacles or setbacks during the months of work; the progression feels too smooth without meaningful resistance or adaptation required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the concrete work of bridge-building between species, avoiding explicit statements. The final image of the orchard as "shared wisdom" resonates without moralizing. The copper wire becomes literal and metaphorical language. Minor deduction for slightly predictable arc of sacrifice-for-legacy without more complex moral ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled distance and some lovely perceptual signatures ("fingers tracing patterns in the air as he slept"). Prose rhythm generally supports the meditative pace. Deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't quite fit ("dormant bridges between human consciousness"), some filter verb reliance, and missed opportunities for more distinctive voice texture during peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. However, multiple instances of abstract phrasing ("architectural secrets," "interspecies respect") appear without sufficient grounding, and there's template repetition in "The [noun] [verb]" openings across several paragraphs. The phrase "architectural secrets" appears four times with minimal variation. Some overwriting in metaphorical descriptions ("symphony of light and growth").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of living stone pillars as dormant bridges offers a fresh angle on nature-human connection. The specific method of copper wire creating geometric patterns tied to constellations is inventive. Deduction for somewhat familiar dying-caretaker-completes-final-task arc and the convenience of finding exactly the right instructions in the predecessor's diary without more complex discovery process.</comment>
