<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The poet's transformation reads more as abstract ascension than embodied struggle—"feeling themselves changing" and "expanding" lacks the concrete internal contradiction needed for higher bands. The motivation to "stride through boundaries" drives action but remains conceptually thin without visceral cost until the very end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the poet's journey building toward transformation, but the closure—becoming a "bridge between seen and unseen"—lands as abstract assertion rather than dramatized change with visible cost. The transformation happens through telling ("the poet felt themselves changing") rather than concrete action that would make the before/after legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium and humming quartz colonnade create atmospheric presence, with the frozen lake providing a mirror motif. However, the setting functions primarily as mystical backdrop rather than constraining choices—the poet simply touches the pillar and transforms without the environment forcing specific tactics or trade-offs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The conflict remains largely internal and abstract—"boundaries between reality and imagination beginning to thin"—without concrete opposition or meaningful tightening. The poet faces no resistance to their transformation; they simply touch the colonnade and achieve their goal without dramatized cost or foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme of artistic freedom versus restriction emerges through the ban/freedom frame and boundary dissolution, but resolves into abstract proclamation about "interconnectedness" without earned complexity. The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("boundaries were not walls but thresholds") rather than letting it emerge from dramatized particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent mystical register but lacks distinct personality—phrases like "testament to ancient craftsmanship" and "tapestry of interconnected moments" read as generic fantasy voice. The POV remains distant and explanatory rather than filtering perception through the specific consciousness of this cloud-shadow poet.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Pervasive abstract phrasing dulls momentum: "boundaries between reality and imagination beginning to thin," "vibration that transcended sound and became pure sensation," "tapestry of interconnected moments." Template mystical language ("ancient craftsmanship," "sacred knowledge," "newfound freedom") and repetitive structure across paragraphs create monotony without propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The cloud-shadow poet concept offers initial intrigue but executes through familiar mystical transformation beats without specific innovation. The resolution—artist becomes bridge between worlds after touching magical object—follows well-worn fantasy templates without transforming them through lived detail or unexpected moral complexity.</comment>
