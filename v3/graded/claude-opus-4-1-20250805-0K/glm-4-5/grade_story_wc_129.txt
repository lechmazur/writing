<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's yearning for connection drives concrete choices throughout, from proposing the shared search to carving the sigil with her found family. The transformation from solitary artist to connected community member is earned through accumulated shared experiences, though some emotional transitions (particularly the group's quick bonding) feel slightly compressed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural structure builds from isolation through shared quest to communal belonging, with the sigil discovery providing meaningful reconfiguration. The closure lands with visible cost (Elara's solitary identity transformed) and the arbor's dedication crystallizes the change, though the middle section's pacing rushes through relationship development.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crater's luminescent fluid and crystalline orchard create a vivid, alien atmosphere that mirrors Elara's isolation and eventual connection. The glimmering obsidian arbor functions as both setting anchor and thematic vessel, though some descriptive passages ("luminescent ache") lean abstract rather than sensory-specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake of belonging escalates from fleeting connections through collaborative search to discovered kinship, with the sigil revelation providing the key turn. The shared exhaustion and laughter during the search creates authentic pressure, though the actual climbing sequences could use more specific physical challenges.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The web imagery threads throughout—from unseen kinship webs to the sigil's spider-web design to the final carved connection—creating resonant thematic coherence. The ending reweights Elara's arbor from solitary achievement to communal hearth without stating the moral explicitly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with phrases like "shaped whispers from marsh-reeds" and "rootless yearning," though occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("boldly sympathetic regard") that feels forced. The Chinese character intrusion "沟通推进" breaks immersion completely and suggests editing oversight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose creates atmospheric density but suffers from abstract descriptors ("luminescent ache" appears twice) and occasional overwriting ("spectral pulses," "tangled sigil"). The Chinese characters are a critical error, and some sentences strain under modifier weight, though key moments like the final dedication achieve clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The crater-edge artist colony with its luminescent geology offers fresh worldbuilding, and the sigil-as-ancient-promise twist transforms expected street art into mythic connection. However, the quick group formation and immediate deep bonding feel somewhat convenient despite the unique setting.</comment>
