<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear but relies heavily on abstract qualities ("devotedly observant eyes") and inherited purpose rather than embodied internal conflict. The character functions adequately as a truth-seeker but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the characterization—she proceeds with methodical certainty rather than genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Eleanor gathering evidence toward a revelation, but the closure lacks visible cost—she simply makes a phone call with confidence. The "orbits of regret" transform to "orbits of justice" but this conceptual shift carries no dramatized price or sacrifice, failing the cost proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting provides atmospheric isolation and serves as a memory-laden workspace, with the dome and echoing walls creating appropriate mood. However, the environment never constrains Eleanor's choices or provides specific resources that alter her tactics—it remains largely decorative despite vivid description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Stakes center on clearing an innocent man and exposing corruption, but the investigation proceeds without meaningful obstacles or pressure that would force trade-offs. Eleanor works undisturbed through the night, and her "proof by contradiction" method encounters no resistance that would test her commitment or exact a price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme of truth-seeking and family legacy emerges through the investigation, with the recurring "orbits of regret" providing some resonance. However, the final realization about intervention ("showing people what they've refused to see") arrives as summary rather than earned insight, and the thematic resolution feels tidy rather than complex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistency with elevated diction appropriate to Eleanor's background, though it lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond general observation skills. Phrases like "devotedly observant" repeat mechanically, and the narration tends toward telling emotional states ("satisfying clarity") rather than embodying them through perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("devotedly observant" appears three times, "echoing observatory above clouds" four times) and template constructions that create monotony. While grammatically clean, the writing relies on abstract descriptors and summary statements ("Hours passed as Eleanor worked") that reduce momentum, with several paragraphs removable without losing essential information.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The corruption investigation with proof by contradiction offers a competent mystery framework, and the observatory setting provides some atmospheric distinction. However, the resolution follows predictable beats without surprising turns, and Eleanor's methodical approach lacks the specific details or unexpected insights that would elevate beyond genre competence.</comment>
