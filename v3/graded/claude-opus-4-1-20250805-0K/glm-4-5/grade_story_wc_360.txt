<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's transposed empathy gift creates genuine internal contradiction as she coldly dissects emotion while craving understanding, and Thomas's borrowed personality manifests through embodied actions (examining drawers, adopting posture). The ethical ambiguity of her invasive research methods remains unresolved without safety-hedging. Deduction for some diagnostic label-speak ("emotional matrices," "mathematics of emotion") in peak moments without sufficient embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Causal lens with Thomas's arrival triggering the empathy transfer that generates Elara's data, leading to a Conceptual Repricing where emotion becomes quantifiable algorithms. The cost is conceptual—human feeling reduced to equations—though the emotional price remains oblique. Minor deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the workshop setting and Elara's role.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The topaz workshop with its luminescent walls and celestial disappearances creates an otherworldly atmosphere that mirrors Elara's detached scientific approach to emotion. The halo fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining her gift and enabling the central empathy transfer. The vanishing stars mark time and accumulate as data points in her equation, charging the final image of orderly patterns.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding emotion through invasive empathy—escalates through Thomas's disorientation and panic as his personality is borrowed and returned. The transfer creates visible cost through his fractured calm and flight. However, the resolution lacks full agency as Thomas becomes passive subject rather than active participant in the conflict's resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of quantifying the unquantifiable emerges through Elara's systematic invasion of others' emotional states, with the final image of "orderly patterns" offering a resonant answer that emotion follows mathematical rules. The piece avoids moralizing while maintaining ethical ambiguity about her methods. Minor deduction for some abstract thematic statements ("mathematics of emotion") that occasionally replace scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's clinical voice modulates effectively from precise observation to cryptic invitation, with distinct perceptual signatures in how she counts stars and maps emotions. The brief dialogue carries subtext and goal-pursuit. Minor issues with Thomas's voice converging too closely with Elara's during the transfer, though this reads as intentional effect of the empathy borrowing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the transfer sequence. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "mathematics of emotion" and "equations," some filter-verb clustering ("she watched," "she needed," "she understood"), and occasional abstract descriptors ("otherworldly luminescence," "unfathomable patterns") that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of transposed empathy as scientific experiment offers a fresh angle on telepathic abilities, treating emotion as quantifiable data rather than mystical connection. The specific synthesis of printing press operator with emotion researcher creates an unexpected juxtaposition. Some derivative elements in the mystical artifact and workshop setting prevent higher scoring.</comment>
