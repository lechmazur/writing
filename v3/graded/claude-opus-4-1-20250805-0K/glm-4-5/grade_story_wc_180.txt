<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reconnect with her daughter is clear and embodied through concrete actions like building the symbolic bridge. The internal conflict between her "feisty nature" and vulnerability shows contradictory impulses acting in scene, particularly when she discovers the ribbon. However, the daughter remains entirely off-page, limiting relationship-as-crucible potential, and some emotional beats rely on telling rather than embodied perception ("her endearingly feisty heart swelled with hope").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's ritual bridge-building culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when she finds the seed—a gesture that reweights her efforts with hope. The cost is visible in her tears "from both eyes, quartz and organic" and the years of separation. Causality holds as her actions generate the daughter's response, though the resolution feels slightly convenient with the overnight bloom.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cathedral setting with its impossible orchard constrains and enables Elara's choices—she must work with found materials, and the apples become central to her bridge metaphor. The quartz eye functions as micro-setting that shapes perception throughout. Sensory details like "sweet scent of apples" and "moss-covered pew" create atmosphere while the spatial choreography of building the bridge remains clear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of reconnection with her daughter is signaled early and deepens through Elara's bridge-building, with meaningful tightening when she discovers the ribbon's disappearance and seed placement. However, the daughter's agency remains entirely off-page, and the resolution relies on coincidence (the overnight bloom) rather than earned pressure. The cost of years of separation is felt but not actively tested in scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of "deciduous vows" emerges organically through the cathedral's persistence despite abandonment and Elara's attempts to bridge generational wisdom. The final line "Deciduous vows fall, but wisdom persists through seasons" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the earlier promise-breaking. However, some thematic statements feel slightly explicit ("Some vows are deciduous, but roots remain") rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices through a mender's lens ("bent nails, cracked porcelain, rope fragments, all waiting for new purpose"). The prose modulates effectively between action and reflection, though occasional filter phrases ("she knew the bridge was working") slightly distance the reader. No dialogue appears, avoiding potential voice convergence issues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm variation, particularly in the bridge-building sequence. Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, some template cadence appears ("She pulled out...Then her fingers brushed...") and redundant phrasing weakens momentum ("endearingly feisty" appears three times). The opening and closing lines effectively frame the piece with the deciduous vows metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of an orchard growing in cathedral rafters offers fresh imagery, and the synthesis of mender tradition with personal loss feels specific. The transformation of the hair ribbon into bridge cordage shows creative problem-solving. While the reconciliation arc follows familiar patterns, the specific details (quartz eye, the Great Departure backdrop) and the metaphor of deciduous vows versus persistent roots elevate beyond template.</comment>
