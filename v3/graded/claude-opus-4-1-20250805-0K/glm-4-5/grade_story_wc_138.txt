<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alistair's millennia of boredom motivating his quest is clear and consistent, with the amulet discovery triggering meaningful action. His transformation from passive observer to active guardian shows earned change through discovery of Elara's sacrifice. However, the emotional complexity relies heavily on summary ("haunted him since losing his beloved") rather than embodied contradiction in scene, and his internal experience during key moments defaults to observation over visceral reaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through Alistair's acceptance of immortality's purpose (Conceptual Repricing), with visible cost in the collapsed escondite and his new guardian burden. The causal chain from boredom→discovery→understanding→action holds, though the revelation about Elara arrives through exposition rather than dramatized discovery. The "what happens after goodbye" question receives thematic answer but lacks concrete dramatic test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite and dimensional windows provide vivid visual anchoring, with the setting actively enabling Alistair's journey through the amulet-created portal. However, sensory detail remains predominantly visual, missing opportunities for other senses during the solar storm or dimensional transitions. The "space between dimensions where time had no meaning" lacks specific texture beyond abstract description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding what comes after goodbye/restoring dimensional balance) is signaled early but escalation occurs through discovery rather than active pressure—Alistair observes rebellions without facing direct opposition. The solar storm creates urgency but doesn't force difficult choices. Cost appears in the escondite's collapse and accepting the guardian role, though neither involves genuine struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of immortality as opportunity rather than curse emerges through Alistair's journey, with the amulet fragments serving as concrete vehicle for exploring loss and continuation. The final insight about goodbye being transition rather than ending resonates with the opening setup. However, the revelation arrives through direct statement ("immortality was not a curse but an opportunity") rather than earned through dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The omniscient narration maintains consistent distance and formal register appropriate to the immortal protagonist, with phrases like "taffy in his immortal mind" showing occasional distinctiveness. However, the voice lacks a unique perceptual signature—descriptions could belong to any educated narrator rather than specifically to someone who has lived millennia. No dialogue appears to test character distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prose clarity suffers from abstract phrasing ("spatial mutiny," "hushed thunder of revelation") and repetitive constructions ("Alistair understood now," "Alistair began," "As Alistair began"). Several metaphors strain clarity ("taffy in his immortal mind," "quiet but powerful force"). Information density is moderate—many sentences advance plot but through summary rather than scene, particularly in the middle sections describing dimensional observations.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept of an immortal discovering purpose through dimensional fragments offers moderate freshness, combining familiar elements (cursed amulet, immortal ennui) in a competent synthesis. The spatial mutiny and prismatic setting provide some originality in detail. However, the resolution through accepting a guardian role and finding meaning in eternal existence follows expected patterns without surprising transformation.</comment>
