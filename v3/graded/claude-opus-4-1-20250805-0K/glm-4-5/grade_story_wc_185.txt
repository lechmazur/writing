<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mapkeeper's motivation is clear and drives concrete action, with decent embodied stress when maintaining the bloom of hush. However, the energy beings' transformation feels too convenient without sufficient internal conflict or cost to the protagonist's choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through harmonization rather than opposition, with visible restoration of the ripple marks. The causality holds but the resolution arrives too smoothly—the energy beings' acceptance of the bloom lacks earned resistance or meaningful complication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The harmonic caves function as active setting, with the Ice Sanctum's crack patterns providing crucial information and the cave's resonances enabling the solution. The sensory detail of vibrations and luminosity serves the concept well, though some descriptions lean generic ("ancient patterns").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—preserving the ripple marks—but escalation is minimal. The bloom of hush works on first attempt without setback or adjustment, and the energy beings offer no meaningful resistance before harmonizing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the harmony-versus-chaos dynamic, avoiding explicit moralizing until the final paragraph's "most powerful magic" statement (-0.5). The transformation from disruption to integration carries thematic weight but lacks complexity or counter-pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with appropriate fantasy register, though lacks distinctive texture. POV control is stable but the perceptual signature remains generic—the mapkeeper notices what any keeper would notice without character-specific bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("ripple-mark mapkeeper" appears 7 times, "harmonic caves" 8 times) and template constructions ("They began studying," "They would learn"). Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum, particularly in the resolution sequence (-0.8 for pattern artifacts).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The concept of harmonizing rather than opposing disruptive forces offers mild freshness, but execution relies on familiar fantasy tropes without transformation. The energy beings remain abstract entities, and the resolution follows predictable paths.</comment>
