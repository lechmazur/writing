I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is a Causal lens story - the narrative follows clear because/therefore linkages as Arion navigates the inversion to discover the source of resilience, with the broken arrow tip's revelation driving the resolution.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arion's motivation is clear and his mission urgent, with the broken arrow tip revelation providing earned causality for the resolution. However, his internal experience lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene - he's too smoothly competent without genuine struggle or blind spots that would compound into mistakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through Decisive Change when Arion discovers the arrow tip's true nature and gains knowledge to transform agriculture. The causal chain holds and orientation anchors are clear. However, the cost remains largely abstract - "knowing that Verdantis would thrive" lacks immediate, felt consequence on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The inverted gravity world is vividly realized with specific details like rivers becoming aerial roads and floating rock arches. The environment directly constrains navigation choices and the First Arch's crystals enable the revelation, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The gravitational inversion creates coherent pressure and Arion's navigation choices show agency. However, escalation plateaus after the inversion begins - the discovery feels convenient rather than hard-won, lacking a meaningful tightening that forecloses options or forces trade-offs with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of resilience and adaptation emerges through concrete worldbuilding and the arrow tip's revelation. However, the ending's wisdom arrives too easily through the echoes' exposition without earned struggle, and the final paragraph states the theme explicitly ("Verdantis would thrive") rather than letting the image resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some evocative phrases like "whirling silence" and "silver serpents." However, Arion's perceptual signature lacks distinction - his observations could belong to any competent pilot, missing the selective bias that would make his perspective memorable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and some strong imagery. Multiple instances of repetitive phrasing weaken momentum: "whirling silence" appears three times, "Arion" opens too many sentences, and filter constructions like "Arion saw" and "Arion knew" dull immediacy in key moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The gravitational inversion concept offers a fresh angle on space agriculture, and the floating rock arches create distinctive worldbuilding. However, the resolution through ancestral echoes revealing secrets feels templated, and the transformation lacks the specific lived detail that would elevate beyond competent genre execution.</comment>
