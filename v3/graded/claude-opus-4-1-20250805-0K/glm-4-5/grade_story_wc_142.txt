<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's dual allegiance creates genuine internal conflict, but the resolution feels too neat—they bridge opposing sides without paying a clear personal cost. The character's "orderly intuitive mind" drives meaningful action through pattern recognition, though emotional embodiment remains abstract ("desperation mounted"). Most critically, the transformation from passive observer to movement conductor happens through summary rather than dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Maya discovering encoded messages and building a resistance movement, but the closure lacks visible cost—the favorable terms arrive without Maya sacrificing anything concrete. The orientation anchors (floating raft city, carnival atmosphere) establish well early. The ending attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through Maya returning the stone chip, but this gesture carries no dramatized price or foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating carnival city creates vivid atmosphere through sensory detail ("fried funnel cakes mingled with saltwater") and the setting actively shapes the conflict through its unique visual communication system. The graffiti murals function as both setting and plot mechanism. However, spatial choreography remains vague—we never understand the actual layout of the rafts or how characters navigate between locations.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>While privatization creates external pressure, Maya faces no meaningful reversals or forced trade-offs—every action succeeds without complication. The stakes (preserving culture vs. development) remain abstract rather than visceral. The resolution arrives too easily through anonymous proposals without Maya risking exposure or choosing between their dual allegiances with consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of cultural preservation through coded resistance emerges organically from the graffiti system, and "The water remembers what land forgets" provides resonant imagery. However, the ending's moral—that bridging sides resolves conflict—feels unearned without depicting actual compromise costs. The foundation stone's symbolic return gestures toward theme but lacks the weight of genuine sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture beyond competent description. Maya's perceptual signature as someone who "recognizes patterns others missed" drives plot but doesn't inflect the prose rhythm or diction. The single line of dialogue feels natural but appears too briefly to establish subtext or character voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose remains functional but suffers from summary-heavy passages ("For three nights, Maya barely slept...") that compress pivotal development. Multiple template constructions appear ("Maya became...", "Maya watched...", "Maya removed..."). The text relies on abstract emotional labels ("desperation mounted," "hope persisted") rather than embodied detail, particularly in high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The concept of graffiti as encoded resistance offers a fresh angle on gentrification stories, but execution remains safely conventional—the community organizes, proposals get submitted, partial victory achieved. The story chooses median options throughout, avoiding both genuine loss and transformative victory. Maya's character arc from observer to conductor follows predictable beats without surprising turns.</comment>
