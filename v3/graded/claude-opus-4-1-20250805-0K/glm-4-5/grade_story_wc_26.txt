<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to catalog shadow anomalies while carrying "luminous regret" creates genuine internal contradiction, particularly when she recognizes her lost friend in the shadow. The final realization that she "meant to preserve the shape of hope" but understood "too late" demonstrates earned character cost through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through repeated observations of the shadow's evolution until the recognition scene creates a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's understanding transforms from professional duty to personal mission with visible emotional cost. The "luminous regret of understanding that comes too late" lands as genuine closure with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The blooming library setting constrains Elara's work through its specific architecture of "crystal dome" and "endless corridors" where shadows behave differently, while the river stone serves as a grounding anchor that eventually becomes "a bridge between moments." The cloud-flower gardens and floating seeds create atmospheric specificity that supports the otherworldly tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional cataloging to personal recognition as the shadow "approached her observation station without hesitation," forcing Elara's confrontation with her lost friend. The cost materializes in her permanent state of "luminous regret" and transformed mission, though the resolution relies somewhat on the shadow's agency rather than Elara's choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of "love's persistence beyond the boundaries of life and death" emerges through concrete shadow movements and Elara's evolving understanding, avoiding direct statement until earned by the recognition scene. The final image of Elara as "not just a keeper of light's progression, but a witness to love's endurance" reweights all prior observation work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "petal-soft leaves" and "shadow unbound," though occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("luminous regret filled Elara") that strains POV plausibility. The perceptual signature of a "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" shapes selective attention to light and shadow patterns throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("shadows stretched and deepened across the endless rows") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around the shadow's movements and multiple instances of abstract emotional labeling ("luminous regret" appears three times). The paraphrase loop in paragraphs 18-19 about Elara's continued vigil dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of a sentient shadow seeking reunion with its source in a post-"Sharing Revolution" world offers genuine freshness, particularly the detail that shadows became unbound after dreams became shareable. The transformation of a technical anomaly into a love story across death boundaries takes real creative risk.</comment>
