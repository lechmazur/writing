<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by both duty and personal need to uncover truth, but her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction - she moves too smoothly from discovery to discovery without genuine struggle or cost. The final choice to disappear carries some weight but isn't fully earned through prior character-specific struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages as Elara discovers each clue, but the closure lacks visible on-page cost - she downloads evidence and disappears, but we don't see what she sacrifices or loses. The ninety-second breach window creates urgency but the consequences remain abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The digital archive setting effectively constrains Elara's investigation through access restrictions and time limits, with specific details like "grayed out sectors" and "warning symbols that glowed like malevolent eyes." The recurring 731 numbers and Stellaris patch create coherent spatial anchors that guide the investigation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine cataloging to uncovering a conspiracy, with the ninety-second access window creating genuine pressure, but the resolution relies on convenient success - Elara downloads "everything she could" without facing real opposition or paying a price. The dominant stake of uncovering truth tightens but lacks a decisive trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus institutional erasure emerges through the archive's "digital necropolis" and deleted files that "went everywhere," but relies heavily on abstract statements like "nothing...could successfully delete the truth forever." The Stellaris patch serves as a concrete motif but the thematic resolution feels declared rather than earned through specific cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistency with tech-noir atmosphere through phrases like "digital ghosts" and "coded silence," but lacks a distinct perceptual signature specific to Elara beyond generic investigator observations. Several instances of overwritten metaphor ("like constellations in a dark sky others couldn't see") and template phrasing weaken authenticity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Pervasive overwriting with mixed metaphors ("silent scream," "digital fingerprint haunting"), template cadence in long compound sentences, and abstract phrasing that tells rather than shows ("feeling the static electricity of forbidden knowledge"). The final paragraph contains multiple paraphrase loops about truth and deletion that dilute impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The digital archive as repository of deleted truths offers a fresh angle on conspiracy thriller, and the 731 recurring numbers create an effective mystery hook. However, the resolution follows predictable whistleblower templates without transforming the familiar arc through specific lived detail.</comment>
