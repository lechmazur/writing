I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara discovers her grandmother's legacy of reflecting light.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "reflect light into dark corners" drives concrete action, and her wistfully pragmatic nature manifests in specific choices. The internal journey from solitary gardener to understanding her grandmother's legacy shows genuine progression. However, Lockmaster Jim appears too conveniently omniscient about Mara's grandmother without earned knowledge, and some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara discovers her grandmother's practice of reflecting light for Jim, reweighting the bitting gauge tooth's meaning. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. However, the coincidental meeting with Jim strains causality, and while the closure lands emotionally, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The luminous harbor setting actively shapes choices - Mara must row to the alcove, use moonlight for her task. The fire escape garden and harbor create vivid contrasts. The bitting gauge tooth functions as micro-setting that constrains technique. Sensory details like "liquid mercury" water and "quivering hush" create atmosphere that supports the meditative tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake - Mara's need to "reflect light into dark corners" - is signaled early and tested when she encounters Jim. However, escalation remains gentle rather than pressured. The story opts for accumulative resonance over conflict-driven tension, which fits the textural lens but limits dramatic pressure. The final "cost" is primarily understanding rather than sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The light/dark metaphor emerges organically through concrete actions - using the bitting gauge tooth to redirect moonlight. The theme of inherited purpose and connection across generations develops through specifics rather than abstractions. The final image of the illuminated alcove offers a non-literal answer about legacy and service. Some thematic statements edge toward directness ("The garden needs light in dark seasons").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains a lyrical, contemplative register appropriate to Mara's character - "wistfully pragmatic heart," "liquid mercury." The prose rhythm supports the meditative pace. Dialogue between Mara and Jim feels slightly stilted but serves the mystical tone. POV remains stable in close third, though Jim's omniscience about Mara's grandmother creates a minor reliability issue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Strong moments like "The water shimmered like liquid mercury" create atmosphere. However, several phrases feel overwritten ("ethereal by the night," "quivering hush of the evening"), and some repetition occurs ("quivering hush" appears twice). The opening and closing images bookend effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of using a lockmaster's tool to reflect light shows creativity, transforming a mundane object into something mystical. The synthesis of urban gardening and harbor mysticism offers a fresh angle. However, the convenient appearance of Jim who knows exactly what Mara needs to learn feels contrived. The story takes fewer risks than it might, staying within comfortable literary fiction boundaries.</comment>
