<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Amelia's motivation to rediscover lost joy is clear and drives her actions, with internal specificity in moments like "liquid dawn" flowing through brushes. The transformation from despair to renewed purpose tracks causally through the discovery and revelation process. However, the secondary characters lack embodied presence—the old woman and child appear only as dialogue vessels, and Amelia's internal conflict remains largely told rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Amelia's discovery building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the community rediscovers joy through art. The closure lands with visible transformation—"The orchard district remained wreathed in fog, but something had shifted." However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt, and the middle section relies heavily on summary ("Local historians had long dismissed...") rather than dramatized beats that would strengthen causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fog-choked ruins create atmospheric pressure, and the fragment discovery is tactilely grounded ("smooth and cool tucked between cobblestones"). The setting evolves from ruins to studio to observatory exhibition space, each location serving the narrative arc. The specialized light-therapy equipment and its specific wavelength adjustments add technical credibility that constrains Amelia's method of revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy—is signaled early and develops through Amelia's technical process of revealing the fragment's hidden images. The conflict deepens when she must convince doubting council members ("ancient dust"), creating modest resistance. However, the resolution arrives too easily through visitor enthusiasm without meaningful opposition or trade-offs that would elevate the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of art bridging past and present emerges organically through the fragment's revelation and community transformation. The final insight "Perhaps all ruins are just stories waiting for the right light" resonates without moralizing. However, the thematic development relies on explicit statements like "to connect past and present through beauty" rather than letting the imagery carry full weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited with specific perceptual details like "stones whispered secrets only she could hear." Dialogue feels natural in the few instances it appears ("We remember how to celebrate"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("pensive mirth lifting her spirits") that doesn't fully align with Amelia's artist perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The prose achieves moments of vivid imagery ("paintbrushes like liquid dawn") and maintains forward momentum. However, several paraphrase loops weaken density: "rediscover the lost joy"/"rediscover lost joy"/"rediscovered lost joy" and the repetitive "fog/mist" constructions. The phrase "pensive mirth" appears twice, creating unnecessary echo, and some sentences rely on telling rather than embodied action ("Amelia knew better").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of "painting with light" to reveal hidden histories offers a fresh angle on archaeological discovery and community healing. The specific method of using light wavelengths to coax colors from ancient surfaces feels inventive and grounded. The transformation from individual artistic crisis to community renewal through illuminated fragments shows organic synthesis rather than template plotting.</comment>
