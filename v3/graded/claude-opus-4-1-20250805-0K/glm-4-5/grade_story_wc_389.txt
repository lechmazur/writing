I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for literary publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation remains consistent but lacks embodied contradiction or struggle; his vigil reads as patient observation rather than active internal conflict. The story tells us about his dedication through summary ("seven years," "self-imposed exile") but rarely shows him making difficult micro-choices under pressure. His singular focus on translation lacks the complexity needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - Elias simply continues his work while events unfold below, creating Earned Stasis without meaningful foreclosure. The piece reads as extended exposition about his role rather than dramatized causality; no concrete before/after change occurs in his situation or stance. The accumulative lens could apply, but density doesn't meaningfully increase toward closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting and cobalt glass portico create vivid atmosphere, with storm patterns and electromagnetic signatures providing texture. However, the setting rarely constrains choices or creates concrete obstacles; it functions more as backdrop than active pressure. The "stormlit" quality and elevation above clouds establish mood effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract throughout - Elias interprets messages and watches a prophet rise, but faces no concrete opposition or meaningful choice that would test his "variant allegiance." The conflict exists entirely in summary (dismissed by authorities) rather than dramatized scene. No escalation occurs; the ending simply confirms his interpretations were correct.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of hidden truths versus loud voices emerges through the radio frequency metaphor, but relies heavily on direct statements ("You've heard only the loud voices"). The parallel between Elias and the rising prophet offers some complexity. However, the piece lacks the earned wisdom that would come from concrete struggle rather than patient observation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency but reads as distant chronicle rather than close psychic access to Elias's experience. Heavy reliance on telling over showing ("lonely visionary," "lyrically prophetic") creates encyclopedia-like exposition. The prose lacks the distinct perceptual signature and selective attention that would elevate voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Significant overwriting issues include abstract declarations ("variant allegiance," "ancient shadows"), repetitive phrasing around the portico and frequencies, and summary-heavy construction that tells rather than dramatizes. Sentences often restate concepts without advancing pressure. The prose achieves atmospheric moments but suffers from density without precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The concept of electromagnetic patterns encoding ancient messages offers originality, as does the parallel between scientific discovery and prophetic revelation. However, execution remains abstract and the protagonist's passive observation role feels safe. The piece doesn't fully commit to either its scientific or mystical possibilities.</comment>
