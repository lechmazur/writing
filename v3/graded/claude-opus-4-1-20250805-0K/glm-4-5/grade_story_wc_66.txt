I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through repetitive expansions and restatements rather than causal progression, with the dust-teaching motivation serving as the dominant stake.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The copyist's motivation is clear and consistent—preserving stories through dust particles—but the character remains static throughout, lacking internal contradiction or meaningful change. The piece tells us she's revolutionary but shows only routine broadcast activity without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; it ends exactly where it began with the copyist continuing her broadcasts unchanged. The accumulative structure repeats information without building to a crystallized moment of cost or transformation. The "story famine" context arrives too late (line 22) to establish stakes early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ember alcove and mist provide atmospheric grounding, and the dust particles function as a unique transmission medium. However, the setting doesn't constrain choices or create pressure—the copyist operates without obstacles or environmental challenges affecting her tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation occurs under the accumulative lens; the broadcast proceeds without complication, discovery, or tightening pressure. The authorities supposedly seek to control narratives but never materialize as active opposition. The copyist faces no on-page test of her commitment or cost for her actions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dust-as-storyteller concept offers thematic potential about preserving narratives, but the story states this theme explicitly rather than developing it through events. The final image of dust whispering narratives lacks resonance because we never see the actual impact or cost of this revolutionary act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The narration maintains third-person limited but lacks a distinct perceptual signature; the copyist notices everything with equal, detached clarity. Prose relies on telling phrases like "revolutionary nature" and "subversive act" rather than showing through selective attention. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Severe repetition loops pervade the text: the story famine context is explained three times, her discovery of dust's properties twice, her broadcast method multiple times. Template cadence ("She had been... She began... She packed...") dominates transitions. The paraphrase loops and redundant exposition significantly harm momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dust-particle transmission system offers modest originality, but the underground-broadcaster-versus-authoritarian-censors framework is heavily templated. The story doesn't transform these familiar elements through specific lived detail or unexpected moral complexity.</comment>
