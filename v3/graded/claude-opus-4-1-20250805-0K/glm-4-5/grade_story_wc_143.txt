<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to document the fireflies is clear and consistent, but her internal experience remains largely descriptive rather than contradictory or embodied. The story tells us about "dawnlit melancholy" settling in her bones but doesn't show conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her final smile and sense of purpose feels unearned—there's no dramatized struggle between competing values that would justify this shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elena photographing the fireflies before their extinction, but the closure lacks visible cost beyond abstract loss. The ending states she "had done her part" without showing what was sacrificed or foreclosed. The chemical timing device serves its function but doesn't create meaningful pressure or constraint that alters her choices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lunar setting is vividly rendered with specific details like "crater valley," "rocky ground," and the transformation from moonlit to sunlit summit. The fireflies' blue bioluminescence creates strong visual imagery. However, the environment doesn't meaningfully constrain Elena's choices—she simply waits and photographs without the setting forcing any difficult decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—documenting the fireflies before extinction—is signaled early but never faces genuine pressure or complication. Elena simply waits for the optimal moment and succeeds without obstacle or trade-off. The chemical timing device creates false tension but doesn't force any meaningful choice or reveal any cost beyond the pre-existing extinction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of progress versus preservation emerges through the fireflies' extinction, but remains at surface level without complexity. The story explicitly states its theme multiple times ("what was being sacrificed in the name of progress") rather than letting it emerge through dramatized conflict. The final image of Elena's satisfaction doesn't offer a resonant answer to the central question—it simply accepts the loss without interrogating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV focused on Elena, with some evocative descriptions like "swirling dance of light below." However, the narrative voice lacks distinctive character—phrases like "purposefully curious by nature" and "dawnlit melancholy" feel writerly rather than emerging from Elena's specific perception. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Severe repetition issues undermine momentum: "moonlit summit" appears 5 times, "dawnlit melancholy" 3 times, "dawning hush" 4 times, "nightwatch's hourglass sand grain" 5 times, "purposefully curious" 2 times. These paraphrase loops and template phrases ("She was determined to," "Elena needed to," "She had done") create mechanical cadence. The story also suffers from telling rather than showing pivotal moments—we're told about Elena's emotions rather than experiencing them through concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise of documenting extinct lunar fireflies offers some novelty, but execution remains generic. Elena functions as a standard observer-protagonist without distinctive traits beyond labels. The story follows a predictable arc without transformation—she arrives to photograph, photographs successfully, and leaves satisfied. No unexpected turns or specific details elevate this beyond template environmental tragedy.</comment>
