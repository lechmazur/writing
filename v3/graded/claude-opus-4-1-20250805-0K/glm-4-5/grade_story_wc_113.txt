<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and builds through his nightly returns and artistic kinship with the ghost, though internal contradiction remains somewhat abstract. The final choice to play the ghost's composition carries visible cost through dissolution of the program. Some interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("felt in his bones," "touched the soul directly") rather than embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through completing the unfinished performance, with the program's dissolution marking visible cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds as water-stained patterns gradually reveal the ghost's code. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the closure lands with the "conversation that silence had interrupted" finally completed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The flooded opera house constrains movement and creates the liminal atmosphere essential to the story's logic. Water damage actively generates the musical notation that drives the plot. The preserved piano amid decay provides the crucial tool for resolution. Setting details like "ankle-deep water" and "flickering lanterns" are woven through action rather than static description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing the ghost's unfinished performance—is signaled early and tightens as Elias decodes the water-stained notation. The program's dissolution provides visible cost. However, escalation remains gentle rather than pressured, with no significant obstacles between discovery and resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of liminal spaces and unfinished art emerges organically through the flooded opera house and ghost's incomplete aria. The water-created notation literalizes how time and nature collaborate in art. The final image of "once-unstruck chords" finding voice resonates without stating a moral, though some phrasing ("暧昧 possibility") feels unnecessarily abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent POV with appropriate distance for Elias's perspective. Some diction elevates beyond necessity ("capricious nature," "liminal threshold") without clear voice motivation. The perceptual signature shows a musician's attention to sound and silence, though syntactic variety could better support emotional modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose flows clearly but contains repetitive phrasing around "water-stained/water-damaged" and abstract constructions like "something he couldn't name but felt in his bones." Information density is moderate—most sentences advance the story but some scaffold remains ("Elias realized he would need to"). No major clarity issues impede comprehension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The water-created musical notation offers a fresh angle on ghost stories and found art. The concept of completing an interrupted performance across decades shows originality. However, the ghost-in-the-opera-house framework follows familiar patterns, and some elements (mysterious disappearance, haunted venue) lean on established tropes without significant transformation.</comment>
