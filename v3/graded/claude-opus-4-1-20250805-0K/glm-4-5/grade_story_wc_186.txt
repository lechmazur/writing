I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through pattern, resonance, and cadence shifts rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by her retrocognitive gift and burden to restore meaning after collapse. The internal progression from daily ritual to revelation to action feels earned. However, the emotional embodiment remains somewhat abstract ("heart filled with thistle-blown hope") and lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara rekindles the beacon, proving "coincidences were not random at all" - a conceptual repricing with felt cost ("would not last forever"). The accumulative structure coheres through glass/light/silence motifs building to the rekindling. Orientation is clear early. The cost could be more visceral at the closure moment itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion functions as both setting and instrument, its resonance with starlight enabling Elara's work. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("walls sang with the wind," "glass panels vibrating with starlight"). The pavilion constrains and enables the central choice, meeting the 9+ gate requirement though not with exceptional vividness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake - proving meaning exists through rekindling the beacon - is signaled early and deepens through Elara's revelation about the "shard of hush." The story shows one meaningful tightening when she aligns the prism with ancient star positions. However, the resolution lacks visceral cost; "fragile light...would not last forever" states rather than embodies the price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of restoration proving that "connections persisted even when the world fell apart." The shard of hush as "space between what was and what could be" offers genuine conceptual depth. The final image of someone seeing the light and following it home resonates without moralizing, though it edges toward the sentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with a lyrical, contemplative register appropriate to the lone custodian. Perceptual signature shows in how Elara experiences time backward and forward simultaneously. Some phrases feel overwrought ("thistle-blown hope") and the prose occasionally drifts toward purple without clear voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the absence that spoke volumes, the gap between stars that held the secret to their paths"). However, several paraphrase loops diminish momentum: "coincidences were not random...threads connecting all moments" restates without advancement. Template cadence appears in repetitive "She [verb]" constructions. Mixed metaphor muddles in "thistle-blown hope" filling a heart.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The retrocognitive gift as both burden and purpose offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic restoration. The concept of tracking ancient star paths to restore a beacon shows genuine originality. The synthesis of silence/knowledge through the "shard of hush" feels conceptually rich, though execution occasionally relies on abstraction rather than grounded specificity.</comment>
