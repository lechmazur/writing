I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and her "functionally creative" trait manifests in concrete actions, but her emotional state remains static throughout - no internal contradiction or cost visible when she succeeds. The character reads more as a vehicle for thematic exploration than a complex individual facing genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Maya discovering the sextant and restoring power, but the closure lacks visible cost - she simply succeeds without sacrifice or trade-off. The "equation for hope" resolution feels unearned as no actual equation or specific breakthrough is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal setting is well-anchored and provides necessary constraints for Maya's work, with specific details like "dusty console" and "massive transformers." However, the setting doesn't actively pressure her choices or create obstacles - it's more backdrop than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of "resurrecting hope through the terminal" is signaled but never tested - Maya faces no meaningful opposition or setback. She works "for hours" but experiences no fatigue, doubt, or technical failure that would create genuine escalation or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of finding hope in abandoned spaces emerges through Maya's actions and the terminal metaphor, but resolves too neatly into "equation for hope" without complexity. The sextant's late inscription reveal feels convenient rather than earned through prior setup.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency and filters observations through Maya's engineering perspective ("mapping possibilities, connecting dots"). However, repetitive constructions like "Maya [verb]" appear throughout, and the prose lacks rhythmic variation under supposed pressure moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on abstract descriptors ("maze of intentions" appears three times, "functionally creative" twice) without concrete dramatization. Template cadence runs through multiple "She [verb]" constructions, and the phrase "equation for hope" substitutes for actual specificity about Maya's discovery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The concept of an engineer finding hope in abandoned infrastructure offers moderate freshness, and the sextant-in-spaceport juxtaposition creates some interest. However, the execution follows predictable beats without surprising turns or specific technical details that would elevate the premise.</comment>
