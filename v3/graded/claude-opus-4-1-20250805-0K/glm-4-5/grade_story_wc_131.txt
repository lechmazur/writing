<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, but lacks embodied emotional contradiction in scene. The character operates with methodical competence throughout without genuine struggle or blind spots that would compound pressure. The final choice to remain hidden while helping feels predetermined rather than earned through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern and density increase toward finding the tape fragment. However, closure lacks visible cost on the page—the protagonist simply continues their established routine of helping from shadows without sacrifice or foreclosed options. The fragment discovery changes tactics but doesn't create a before/after with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strong spatial choreography through crawl spaces and pipe chases creates a lived-in underground world. The ferromagnetic tape fragment carries specific sensory detail and historical weight. However, the environment doesn't meaningfully constrain choices at closure—the protagonist moves through familiar spaces without the setting forcing trade-offs or charging the final decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (helping while remaining hidden) is signaled early but never faces genuine pressure or test. The tape discovery represents accumulation rather than escalation—no options narrow, no prices are paid. The protagonist's decision to continue their established pattern lacks the tightening or deepening that would create cost under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of invisible service emerges through concrete action and the tape fragment motif. However, the ending doesn't offer a resonant answer that reweights prior material—the protagonist simply continues their pattern without confronting the cost of perpetual hiddenness. The story states rather than dramatizes the value of hidden knowledge preservation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with selective perception reflecting the protagonist's archival expertise and spatial knowledge. Strong perceptual signature in how they navigate by touch and memory. However, some register drift into elevated diction ("sapphire hush," "kindly methodical grace") that doesn't match the character's practical mindset during physical navigation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose has moments of specificity but suffers from repetitive phrasing around the protagonist's motivation ("to become visible to those who needed you") appearing nearly verbatim three times. Template cadence in middle sections with "They [verb]" constructions. The closing paragraph contains abstract summary rather than concrete image, dulling closure impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The crawl space dweller premise offers potential but executes as expected—a former employee secretly helping the library. The tape fragment discovery follows predictable beats without transformation. The story doesn't risk bold choices or subvert expectations, settling for the safety middle of benevolent helper narrative without examining darker implications of this existence.</comment>
