<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The traveler's motivation is consistently rooted in his survivor's guilt and need to process loss through writing obituaries for the living. His internal contradiction between projection of presence and avoiding true presence creates genuine tension. However, the final turn toward writing his own obituary, while earned, relies on some abstract emotional progression ("something beautiful and painful was beginning to heal") rather than fully embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the traveler's decision to write his own obituary. This Resonant Reconfiguration lands with emotional cost visible in lines like "mapping territories of his heart he had avoided exploring since the palace had fallen." However, the cost remains primarily internal without external stakes, and the accumulation relies heavily on reflection rather than present-moment pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("earth, decay, and the lingering perfume of vanished blooms") that mirrors the protagonist's internal state. The crimson weft thread functions as micro-setting, constraining his emotional connection to the past. The garden's transformation from "lonesome" to a space of potential healing charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the traveler can move beyond chronicling others' emotional deaths to confronting his own—is signaled early and deepens through accumulation. However, escalation occurs primarily through internal reflection rather than external pressure, with no meaningful obstacles or reversals. The final choice to write his own obituary arrives through gradual realization rather than forced decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of confronting one's own absences while documenting others' emerges organically through the traveler's profession and the palace carpet thread. The concept of "obituaries for the living" offers genuine insight into how people become ghosts to themselves. The ending's suggestion that understanding others' wounds enables self-healing resonates without explicit moralizing, though some passages edge toward abstraction ("geography of healing").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistent literary elevation with controlled rhythm and selective perception fitting a contemplative narrator. POV distance remains stable in close third. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("geography of self," "territories of his heart") that feels less grounded than the concrete imagery, and some repetitive phrasing appears ("shadowed garden" used 6 times).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong moments of specificity ("crimson weft shimmered in the fading light") and varies sentence structure effectively. However, several paraphrase loops appear (lines about projection of presence repeat similar content), and abstract phrases like "geography of healing" and "lonesome splendor" lean toward purple prose. The template pattern of "He [verb]" appears in multiple consecutive sentences mid-story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The concept of writing obituaries for the living offers a fresh angle on grief and emotional death. The synthesis of this profession with the traveler's survivor guilt creates organic complexity. However, the execution relies on familiar literary tropes (autumn garden as death/rebirth, single treasured object as memory anchor) without sufficient transformation to feel fully original.</comment>
