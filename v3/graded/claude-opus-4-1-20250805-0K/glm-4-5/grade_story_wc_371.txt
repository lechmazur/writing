<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation to "find the sacred in the ordinary" drives her actions consistently, though internal contradiction remains mostly told rather than embodied. The revelation about the bakers' disappearance provides earned causality for her "tenuous absolution," but peak moments like reading the letter aloud lack embodied emotion—we get action without feeling her voice shake or hands tremble.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Eliza's absolution and her leaving bread for others, with visible cost in abandoning the tea house "one last time." The accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer toward meaning, though the critical letter's content arrives through summary rather than dramatization, weakening the closure's impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned palace grounds and tea house effectively constrain choices—Eliza must work within decay and secrecy. Sensory details like "wild sages and mint pushing through cracked flagstones" and rain drumming on tin create atmosphere that supports the dominant stake of uncovering hidden meaning in neglected spaces.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Escalation occurs through accumulation—from noticing decay to finding the tea house to discovering letters to revealing truth—but lacks a meaningful tightening that forecloses options. The revelation about the bakers doesn't force Eliza to choose or sacrifice; her absolution arrives without visible struggle or trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that the bakers' disappearance was an act of protection, reweighting Eliza's guilt about past silence. The bread's transformation from simple gift to "forgiveness meant to be shared" offers resonance, though the final paragraph veers toward explicit thematic statement with "patient uncovering of truth, one small revelation at a time."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "creeping normality noticer" and selective perception of decay, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("tenuous absolution settling"). The critical moment of reading the letter aloud lacks dialogue or free indirect discourse that would deepen POV immersion during the story's emotional peak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose suffers from paraphrase loops ("sacred in the ordinary" appears twice; "vanished bakery" recurs without variation) and filter-heavy construction in key beats. Lines like "Eliza understood that meaningful truths often hid in plain sight" tell what could be shown through action, though sensory details and rhythm variation prevent complete stagnation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of guerrilla gardening as resistance through care offers freshness, as does the specific detail of "Sweet Morning" bakery and its hidden purpose. However, the revelation follows a familiar pattern of discovered letters explaining disappearance, and Eliza's role as sensitive observer of decay doesn't sufficiently transform the archetype.</comment>
