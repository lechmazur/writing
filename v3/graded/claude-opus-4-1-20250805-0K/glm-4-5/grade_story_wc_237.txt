<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's crystallization affliction creates genuine stakes that compound under pressure, with embodied stress responses ("telltale prickle") and concrete coping mechanisms. The transformation of scars into protective wisdom earns its resolution through accumulated detail, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("knowing that her strange affliction might activate").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through ritual details toward successful transformation despite crystallization threat. The closure lands with visible cost—scars becoming "stories of caution and resilience"—and the quill tip falling signals perfect execution. Minor deduction for slightly soft causality around why the platform tilts "unnaturally."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating platform constrains action (limited time between storms) and sensory details layer effectively ("vapors coiling upward like miniature dragons"). The moss-covered stone, luminescent ink, and meticulously trimmed quill create lived-in specificity that shapes the ritual's execution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from attempting transformation to fighting crystallization when the platform tilts, with genuine cost in nearly shattering. The "breath between tempests" creates temporal pressure, though the resolution feels slightly convenient with crystallization halting "just before" compromise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through transformation of trauma into wisdom without explicit moralizing. The childhood knot-tying superstition and grandmother's teachings layer meaning, with the final image of "memory turned to wisdom" resonating without stating a lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person with character-specific perception ("miniature dragons," "living creature emerging from myth"). Some filter verb accumulation ("she felt," "she watched") and occasional register elevation ("meticulously trimmed tip") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, though some redundancy appears ("telltale prickle of crystallization beginning" followed by "crystallization halting"). Template phrasing clusters around "she [verb]" constructions and some elevated diction ("saturated hush") feels slightly forced.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystallization affliction offers a fresh physical manifestation of emotional paralysis, and transforming scars into protective runes provides non-obvious synthesis. The magical academy setting feels somewhat familiar, though the specific ritual mechanics add distinction.</comment>
