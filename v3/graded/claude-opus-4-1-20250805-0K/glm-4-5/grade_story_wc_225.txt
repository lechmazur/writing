I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered reflection and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where forgiveness crystallizes.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tutor's motivation is clear but relies heavily on backstory exposition rather than embodied present-scene struggle. His guilt and need for redemption are stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The prince's sudden appearance and reconciliation feels unearned - we don't see the tutor make choices under pressure that would justify this forgiveness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost on the page - the prince simply offers reconciliation without the tutor paying any price or making a decisive choice. The story violates the single-scene requirement with unexplained transitions between the tapestry work and entering the labyrinth. Causality breaks when the prince appears suspended yet conscious, and time restarts without clear mechanism.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The time-frozen village and platinum labyrinth create atmosphere but don't constrain choices meaningfully. The tapestry's threads and their decoding are described abstractly without specific sensory detail. The four-minute window creates urgency but isn't tracked precisely enough to generate real pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (achieving forgiveness) is signaled but never faces concrete on-page test - the tutor's tapestry work is described as methodical but we don't see him struggle with specific choices or trade-offs. The time pressure exists conceptually but doesn't force any visible decisions. Resolution arrives through the prince's unexplained appearance rather than protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The redemption theme emerges clearly but through direct statement ("redemption had been his all along—he had only needed to forgive himself") rather than earned realization. The tapestry-as-memory metaphor has potential but remains abstract. The story tells us about forgiveness rather than dramatizing the specific cost of achieving it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistency with elevated literary register appropriate to the premise. However, it lacks distinct perceptual signature - the tutor's chess-master perspective doesn't meaningfully filter what he notices. Phrases like "fierce repose" and "productive fidgeting" feel forced rather than organic to the character's voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Significant paraphrase loops damage momentum: "frozen/suspended/locked," "time-frozen/stifled all time/time loosened its grip" repeat the same concepts. Template cadence appears in "His fingers fidgeted...His fingers trembled...His fingers flying." The prose reaches for literary effect with "woven hush" and "fierce repose" but these feel ornamental rather than purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The time-frozen village with daily four-minute windows offers a fresh constraint, and linking chess strategy to redemption shows promise. However, execution remains generic - the tutor could be any guilty exile, the magical elements feel arbitrary rather than integral. The reconciliation follows predictable redemption templates without surprising inflection.</comment>
