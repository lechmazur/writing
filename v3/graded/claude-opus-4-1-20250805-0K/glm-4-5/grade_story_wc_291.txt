<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's face-blindness creates a compelling character premise with clear motivation for her investigative method, but internal conflict remains largely conceptual rather than embodied in scene. The story declares her unique qualification but doesn't dramatize how her condition creates specific investigative advantages through concrete choices under pressure. Her final insight about the assistant arrives through inference rather than earned struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage from ribbon discovery to guest list analysis to final deduction, but the closure lacks visible on-page cost. The confession happens off-page in summary ("led to a confession"), violating the requirement for on-page closure with felt consequence. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear early, preventing further deduction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quarry setting with its "furrowed hush" and mist creates atmospheric pressure and provides specific spatial details that Elena physically engages with. Her tactile investigation of the walls and terrain demonstrates lived-in use of environment. However, the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain her choices or alter her tactics beyond providing a location for investigation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (solving a cold case) is clear but escalation remains flat—Elena methodically eliminates possibilities without encountering meaningful resistance or complication. No on-page reversal occurs; the investigation proceeds linearly from clue to analysis to solution. The cost of justice delayed is declared but not dramatized through present-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of awakening dormant empathy emerges through Elena's stated motivation and the community's selective forgetting, but resolution occurs through exposition ("Justice has been dormant") rather than earned resonance. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about empathy and closure, replacing scene pressure with thematic summary that triggers the anti-pattern penalty for theme statements in lieu of dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elena's perceptual signature as someone who experiences the world through "shapes, shadows, and textures" creates a distinct POV with consistent focalization. The narrative maintains stable third-person limited perspective without head-hopping. However, dialogue lacks subtext and goal-pursuit, serving primarily as information exchange rather than action with stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates competent clarity but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("Elena" appears 11 times) and template cadence in investigation sequences. Several paraphrase loops occur, particularly around the masquerade/mask descriptions. The final paragraph's abstract moralizing ("Justice has been dormant...empathy never truly disappears") abandons concrete imagery for conceptual summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The face-blind detective concept offers a fresh angle on the cold case genre, and the masquerade setting provides thematic resonance with identity and recognition. However, execution remains safe and procedural—the investigation follows predictable beats without surprising turns or genuine risk. The resolution through off-page confession avoids the harder work of dramatized confrontation.</comment>
