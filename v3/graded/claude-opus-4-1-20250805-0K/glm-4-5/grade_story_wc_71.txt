I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to understand living houses is clear and consistent, but her internal experience lacks embodied contradiction—she observes and collects methodically without genuine struggle or cost. The revelation about houses holding "pieces of those who'd loved them" arrives as unearned epiphany rather than through dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Aria's ritualistic collecting building toward understanding, but the closure—her realization about love leaving traces—lacks visible cost or meaningful reconfiguration. The revelation doesn't alter her tactics or foreclose options; she simply continues her walks with new knowledge that doesn't change her actions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quiet bay setting and predawn atmosphere are vividly rendered with selective detail ("streetlights daydreamed," "dew-kissed streets"), and the lighthouse keeper's cottage functions as meaningful micro-setting. However, the environment doesn't constrain choices—Aria moves freely without spatial pressure affecting her decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—never faces genuine opposition or escalating pressure. The orris root shard's discovery and placement create mild accumulation but no meaningful tightening; Aria achieves her goal without struggle, trade-off, or visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of presence lingering through loved objects emerges through concrete details and the shard's function as "captured silence." However, the final paragraph explicitly states the thesis ("what makes a house alive is simply the echo of lives..."), converting subtext into direct moralizing that undermines resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("noticed when things went slowly wrong"). However, interiority often tells rather than embodies ("This gift made her sensitive"), and several passages drift into elevated diction that feels performative rather than character-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "houses breathed with life while others merely occupied space" restated as "some spaces breathed while others only existed." Template phrases like "inadvertently profound" and "hushed blaze" feel forced rather than organic. The final paragraph's explicit theme statement and repetitive "quiet bay in spring" undermine line-level craft.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The concept of collecting displaced objects to understand living spaces offers a fresh angle, and the orris root as "shard of hush" shows imaginative specificity. However, the execution relies on familiar mystical-realism tropes without sufficient transformation, and the resolution defaults to the predictable "love leaves traces" sentiment.</comment>
