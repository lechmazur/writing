<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and grounded in her "forgiving skeptic" nature, with concrete embodiment through her bone-setting inheritance and the physical handling of the changeling tooth. The final choice to practice bone-setting "on the air between them" shows contradictory impulses acting in scene. However, Arthur's characterization remains vague—neither fully the lost child nor the otherworldly being—and his dialogue ("Building...turning mistakes into constellations") reads as thematic echo rather than authentic voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Eleanor's acceptance of mystery over certainty, with visible cost in abandoning her scientific worldview. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and garden imagery build toward the final boundary dissolution. However, orientation anchors arrive late (the Wembley estate maze isn't clearly established until line 4), and the "substitute body" backstory creates initial confusion about what actually happened to Arthur.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The secret garden functions as more than setting—its "Victorian-era botanical engineering" with inverted blooms and captured firefly light mirrors the story's central tension between science and magic. The maze walls dissolving according to "patterns only Arthur could perceive" directly shapes the final transformation. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout, though some details (the gardener's boy) appear without consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on Eleanor's need to understand Arthur's transformation and potentially rescue him, with escalation through the bone-setting ritual that bridges realms. The tooth's vibration and the garden's edge-blurring create one meaningful tightening. However, the conflict lacks urgency—Eleanor faces no opposing force or time pressure, and the resolution comes too easily through mutual recognition without genuine cost or struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between skepticism and wonder, with the bone-setting practice serving as concrete metaphor for mending reality's fractures. The final image of "the constellation they would become together" resonates without stating a moral. However, Arthur's dialogue ("turning mistakes into constellations") explicitly echoes the thematic premise in prompt-like language, and the transformation from skepticism to wonder resolves too neatly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Eleanor's perceptual signature shows in phrases like "iridescent luminescence" and "shrewdly innocent," maintaining a scholarly-yet-open voice. The narrative distance remains stable in close third. However, dialogue lacks naturalism—Arthur speaks in abstract pronouncements ("Building...turning mistakes into constellations") rather than believable speech, and both characters converge toward philosophical abstraction in the final exchanges.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates control with varied sentence structures and specific imagery like "moonpetals that had just begun to open in the garden's perpetual twilight." Information density is generally strong. However, several passages contain unnecessary scaffolding ("Eleanor had always been," "The discovery...had created"), and the phrase "turning mistakes into constellations" appears three times, creating a paraphrase loop that dulls impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of bone-setting as a practice that works "across realms too" offers a fresh angle on portal fantasy, grounding the supernatural in Eleanor's inherited healing tradition. The changeling tooth as physical evidence and the garden's "nostalgic innovation" avoid generic fantasy tropes. The piece commits to its premise of bridging scientific skepticism with mystical acceptance, though the resolution tends toward the safety middle rather than bold risk.</comment>
