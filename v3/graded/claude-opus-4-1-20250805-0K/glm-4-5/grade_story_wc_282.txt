<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to understand and translate the unknown drives consistent choices throughout, with embodied sensory details like "fingers tingled with residual energy." The character demonstrates clear internal consistency and makes a meaningful choice to accept her role as translator, though the emotional complexity could deepen during the fossil encounter rather than accepting its purpose so readily.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear Causal lens with Maya's discovery leading to understanding her purpose, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she accepts her role as translator of the hibernation's mysteries. The closure lands with conceptual cost—she must carry this burden of knowledge—though the emotional price could be more viscerally felt. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cave network functions as more than backdrop, constraining Maya's movements ("rope creaking with each movement") and enabling discovery through its preserved emotional imprints. The thermal mapping of emotions creates a unique sensory layer with "bright reds indicated lingering passion or fear, deep blues showed sorrow." The elm fossil's gravity-defying property and the cave as guardian of knowledge directly shape the final revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding what transpired during hibernation—escalates from general exploration to personal calling when Maya discovers the fossil. The pressure tightens as she descends deeper into older emotional imprints, culminating in her acceptance of the translator role. However, the fossil's cooperation comes too easily without meaningful resistance or trade-off that would heighten the cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of bridging unknown and known emerges through concrete action—Maya literally descending into darkness to retrieve knowledge. The elm fossil as "transitional object" resonates beyond its literal function, and the final image of Maya carrying this "factually mystical guide" reweights her earlier compulsion to explore. The piece avoids explicit moralizing, though the revelation sequence could trust more in implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maya's perceptual signature comes through her sensory sensitivity ("residual energy left by sleeping humans") and professional lens viewing emotions as mappable terrain. The prose modulates from technical precision during equipment setup to wonder during the fossil encounter. The single line of dialogue "How can you float?" captures genuine awe, though the narrative occasionally over-explains what the dramatization already shows.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts, particularly effective in the descent sequence. Some redundancy appears in explaining the thermal mapping system and the fossil's significance. Phrases like "truly factually mystical phenomenon" feel forced, and the final paragraph contains unnecessary summary ("The reborn world above would soon learn") that could trust more in the image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of mapping emotional residues as thermal signatures offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic awakening narratives. The floating elm fossil that communicates through heat signatures rather than words shows genuine inventiveness. The piece synthesizes mystical and technological elements uniquely, though it plays somewhat safe in having Maya accept her destiny without more complex resistance.</comment>
