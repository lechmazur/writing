<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "seek out the joy beneath anguish" drives concrete micro-choices throughout, particularly in memorizing and deploying the diary line. Internal contradictions between curiosity and propriety create genuine tension. The astronomer's characterization through absence and then presence works well, though his immediate warmth slightly undercuts the established isolation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with the diary discovery providing the crucial intensification that enables the final connection. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "travelers aloft in wounded air" with clear emotional cost in both characters' cautious vulnerability. The encrypted diary functions as perfect causal pressure that transforms the servant's approach.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire and frost-coated elevator mesh create atmospheric pressure that mirrors emotional states. "Scattered light" becomes a recurring visual motif that enables the diary's opening and charges the final tea scene. The elevator's mechanical details (groaning, brass bars, ten floors) provide spatial coherence though some descriptions edge toward ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of connection-through-understanding escalates cleanly from rehearsed conversations through diary discovery to the whispered line exchange. The elevator's ascent provides natural time pressure. Cost is visible in the risk taken and the "cautious step" of anguish retreating, though the resolution feels slightly too neat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of joy hidden beneath anguish emerges organically through the diary's revelations and the memorized line "Pain is a lantern; joy is the oil." The final image of shared sunrise on silver reweights all prior isolation imagery. Subtext operates beautifully in the unspoken recognition between servant and astronomer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice combines elevated diction ("livery," "vestibule") with precise sensory details. The perceptual signature of noticing light patterns and mechanical sounds remains consistent. Minor register elevation in places ("affectionate detachment") but largely maintains the servant's educated yet subordinate perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic variety, though some ornamental phrases ("sea kisses," "fidgeting fireflies") edge toward overwriting. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some filter constructions ("I felt," "I saw") and occasional template phrasing ("I remembered," "I realized") dull immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The encrypted diary as emotional archaeology offers a fresh angle on the servant-master dynamic. The specific detail of reading through frost and light to unlock secrets shows originality. The astronomer writing tender confessions in code above the clouds creates memorable specificity, though the resolution trends toward emotional safety.</comment>
