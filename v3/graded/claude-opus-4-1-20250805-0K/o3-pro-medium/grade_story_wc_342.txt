I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through sensory detail and pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration where Liora's limitation becomes her gift.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's face blindness as both limitation and "tuning fork" creates genuine internal contradiction acted out through her portrait work. The final choice to paint blindfolded demonstrates embodied agency with clear cost—risking the observatory opportunity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("alternative senses," "weather of intention") that briefly distances from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from personal limitation through coin discovery to transformed observatory, with each beat deepening Liora's relationship to unseeable perception. The closure—city rescinding demolition after crews witness the mural's effect—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (blindfolded risk) and conceptual shift (limitation becoming architecture). Slight deduction for the warden's somewhat convenient appearance at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tree trunk library with "shelves grown directly from living cambium" and the observatory dome "crouched amid scaffolding like a tired moon" create vivid, constraining spaces that shape Liora's choices. Sensory detail filters through her non-visual perception ("texture of voices," "temperature, sound bounce"). The environment directly enables the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal limitation through the observatory deadline to the arrival of demolition crews, with Liora's blindfolded painting as the decisive risk. The pressure coheres well under the accumulative lens as density increases toward the climax. Minor weakness in the somewhat passive resolution where others (crews, city) react rather than Liora facing a final choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of unseeable sight—"craft without sight, craft beyond likeness"—culminating in Liora seeing "no faces, no walls, only sky folding forever into itself." The mural that "shifted with his voice, mirroring internal weather" offers a non-literal answer about perception beyond physical sight. Slight deduction for the abstract "unseeable architecture" phrase.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("faces slipped from her mind like chalk in rain"). The prose modulates effectively during the painting sequence with shorter, more immediate phrasing. Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from Liora's established register ("fractally precise," "consecrating the hush").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("the weather of your intention," "unseeable architecture") and some abstract phrasing that reduces immediacy. The "fractally precise" repetition and elevated register in peak moments create minor friction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of face blindness with artistic genius creates an original premise executed with specificity. The coin's message to "craft" and the mural that mirrors viewers' internal states offer non-obvious developments. The transformation of limitation into gift through sensory alternatives feels earned and avoids cliché resolution.</comment>
