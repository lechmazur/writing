<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "map empathy onto action" drives consistent choices through mirror-seeking, fragment-carrying, and partnership-forming, with internal tension between doubt and conviction ("doubts curled like smoke inside conviction"). The final choice to join shards and broadcast patterns shows earned change with visible cost (leaving safety for ambassador work). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("calmly intuitive" trait relies on telling) and occasional diagnostic language ("reconstitute the oracle's vision into something actionable").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and emotional cartography build toward Resonant Reconfiguration where two become ambassadors. Closure lands with visible cost: "Tomorrow the two would depart with packs of seedlings" shows path foreclosed. Strong causality through mirror→figure→map→shards→light projection sequence. Orientation anchored early with lighthouse orchard setting, though some abstract elements ("emotional cartography") slightly muddy the physical mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Opening establishes vivid polar orchard with "gnarled apple trunks" and "fruit glowed like small lanterns," creating distinctive atmosphere. Setting constrains choices through ice floes limiting access, mirrors as portals, and tunnels providing dangerous refuge. The lighthouse lens becomes instrumental for broadcasting patterns. Minor deduction for some generic weather descriptions and the emotional map concept that strains physical grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of finding/becoming the "courageous anomaly" drives escalation from patrol→mirror vision→sprint→descent→partnership. Pressure tightens as Mara moves from observer to active participant, with visible cost in abandoning safety. The revelation that anomaly is "never a lone hero" but "actionable bond" provides meaningful deepening. Some middle sections lack immediate pressure (map reading, exposition about oracle).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of collective courage over individual heroism emerges through action, crystallizing in "the courageous anomaly was never a lone hero; it was the actionable bond." The emotional cartography literalizes mapping empathy onto action without heavy-handed moralizing. Final image of sea recalibrating rhythm resonates. Slight deduction for the abstract "kindness, grief, and resolve" map that feels conceptually convenient.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled imagery ("doubts curled like smoke inside conviction") and varied syntax. Dialogue between Mara and Silas carries appropriate subtext and advances plot. Some filter verb clusters ("Mara realized," "She felt," "Mara considered") dull immediacy in middle sections. POV remains stable with Mara throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("Spray from the polar sea hissed against gnarled apple trunks") but suffers from abstract passages that slow momentum ("reconstitute the oracle's vision into something actionable"). Some paraphrase loops around the emotional mapping concept. Filter verb stacks in middle sections ("Mara believed," "She intended," "Mara paused") reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The emotional cartography concept offers fresh angle on empathy-as-navigation, and the mirror portals create distinctive world logic. The twist that courage lies in connection rather than individual heroism transforms the prophecy trope. Some elements feel workshopped (crystal ball fragments, lighthouse keeper) without full transformation.</comment>
