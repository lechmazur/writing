I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is a Hybrid piece, primarily Accumulative/Textural with Causal elements. The story builds through layered details about Selis's craft and the political conspiracy, culminating in her decision to act. I'll judge closure under the Accumulative lens dominant at the end.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Selis emerges as a compelling character through the contradiction between her "foolish smile" performance and her sophisticated conspiracy-mapping. Her micro-choices (feigning clumsiness with the spool, claiming the map is for "library mice") reveal survival tactics earned through "three regimes." The moment with Voren crystallizes her values—preserving knowledge over personal safety—with visible risk.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The closure achieves Charged Poise: Selis stands at a crystallized moment where she must act within a two-hour window, with legible stakes (archivists' lives, knowledge preservation) and felt cost (leaving safety for danger). The accumulative build through embroidery-as-conspiracy-mapping pays off when "supply trains would divert at dawn" emerges from her method. Minor orientation wobble with "telegraphs" and "royal archive" arriving late without clear spatial relationship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory functions as more than backdrop—its "vaulted dome" creates the echoed silence Selis needs, its rotating roof mechanism enables her star-mapping, and its isolation both protects and exposes her. The eternal candle's "smokeless light" revealing invisible dyes is a strong micro-setting element that constrains her method. Spatial choreography during Voren's inspection is clean and tense.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from solitary work to Voren's arrival to the discovered intelligence about the two-hour window. The dominant stake (preserving knowledge before the coup) tightens when Voren's inspection threatens exposure, then crystallizes into immediate action. Cost is visible in her choice to leave sanctuary, though the final confrontation remains ahead.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of hidden patterns—both in stars and conspiracies—that only careful attention can reveal. The disguise of "wisdom as foolishness" resonates beyond survival tactic to comment on how power misreads craft as harmless. The final image of Selis moving through darkness "guided by the quiet flame" offers a non-literal answer about resistance through apparent compliance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains elegant formality fitting an embroiderer who thinks in patterns: "Every shimmer told a fragmentary rumor: troop movements measured in eclipses." POV control slips briefly when describing what "court informants expected" without clear sourcing. Dialogue between Selis and Voren effectively carries subtext—her performed stupidity against his condescension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("galaxies bloomed like secrets admitting they wished to be found") but suffers from occasional overwriting. Some metaphors strain ("boots shining like overturned moons"). Information density is generally high, though phrases like "foolishly, exactly as" and "merely a winter curtain" could be tightened. The final line about "victorious" feels presumptuous.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of embroidery-as-espionage offers fresh transformation of craft-as-resistance. "Adjacent possibilities" as a conceptual tool for conspiracy-mapping is inventive and specific to this world. The intersection of artisanship, astronomy, and intelligence work creates an original synthesis that feels inevitable rather than forced.</comment>
