<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to honor her father through ritual despite temporal separation is clear and compelling. Internal conflict between isolation and duty manifests through concrete actions (killing the lamp, orienting the compass, sketching from memory). The final choice to walk forward "letting the echoed silence follow" shows earned endurance with visible emotional cost through the tear and paper ship offering.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through layered images (compass gold/silver, starlight piercing darkness, paper ship). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the protagonist crystallizes her stance as explorer rather than exile with visible cost (father's temporal distance, station isolation). The orientation anchors establish clearly: station corridor, post-shutdown, anniversary ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observation deck setting constrains choice through shutdown protocols and shield closure, then enables action when sensors autonomously open the viewing slit. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (thrumming machinery gone silent, dust motes in panel glow, metal cooling creaks). The compass rose becomes micro-setting that guides final reorientation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (maintaining family connection across temporal barrier) deepens through accumulating pressures: darkness, isolation, mysterious intercom voice. The shield's autonomous opening represents meaningful escalation that forces the protagonist to confront real stars versus memory. Cost is legible in the temporal stretch preventing reunion and the acceptance of "blessed pariah" status.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the compass metaphor—"whoever follows true north never drifts, no matter how warped the clocks"—without explicit moralizing. The final reweighting of "blessed pariah" as purposeful wanderer like a comet resonates through earned particulars. The ending's transformation of confusion into exploration offers a non-literal answer to isolation through chosen direction rather than location.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm that modulates under pressure (shorter fragments during starlight revelation). Perceptual signature shows selective attention to navigation and orientation details befitting someone trained in space travel. Minor register elevation in phrases like "temporally stretched" and "resonant emptiness" occasionally strains against more grounded moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong momentum with varied sentence lengths creating visual rhythm. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character state, and symbolic weight simultaneously. Some mild figurative density in emotional beats ("darkness poured over the deck like cold water") but serves accumulative texture rather than obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The temporal stretching concept offers fresh angle on separation grief, avoiding simple death or distance. Specific details (father in frozen medical ward, family fence constellation) ground the universal in particular. The integration of hard SF elements (time dilation, shield protocols) with intimate ritual creates memorable synthesis.</comment>
