I'll evaluate this literary story according to the demanding editorial standards provided.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Declan's internal conflict between cynicism and hope drives genuine micro-choices through the cameo visitors, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously (doubt vs. creative yearning). The final choice to "walk against the current of my own despair" carries visible emotional cost through the mirror confrontation. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("ferocious clarity") and the visitors feeling more allegorical than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern teaching through the three cameo visitors building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Declan accepts endless creative struggle. Cost is visible in "I hope to walk against the current of my own despair and still arrive singing" - accepting perpetual difficulty. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, mist, writer at desk) establish clearly by line 3. Deduction for the conceptual cost being more stated than fully dramatized in concrete terms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting constrains choices effectively - the broken isolation forces Declan to summon hope internally rather than seek external validation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("mist pooled like quiet ink," "splinters of moonlight"). The seashell fragment functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Minor deduction for some atmospheric description that doesn't always pressure choice directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative deepening as each visitor adds complexity to hope's definition, narrowing Declan's options from abstract cynicism to concrete acceptance. The dominant stake (finding authentic hope for the ending) coheres throughout. Cost appears in accepting perpetual struggle rather than resolution. Deduction for the visitors feeling somewhat predetermined rather than creating genuine surprise or reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the accumulation of hope-shapes, avoiding direct moralizing until earned through experience. The final realization that "the book would never end" offers a non-literal answer about creative persistence. The seashell motif ("beauty sometimes lived against the current") effectively charges the closure. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction in thematic articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("Mist pooled like quiet ink"). The perceptual signature is consistent - a writer noticing in literary metaphors. No head-hopping, stable close third throughout. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds Declan's established lexicon ("ephemeral cameo appearances").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong information density with most lines doing multiple jobs. Vivid selective imagery ("beard laced with salt diamonds," "leaves trembling like unread punctuation"). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats without full payoff (-0.4). Occasional abstract phrasing ("ferocious clarity," "tidal cynicism") that could be more concrete (-0.3).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The conceit of hope manifesting as visitor-cameos offers fresh inflection on the writer's-block narrative. Specific details (seedlings in teacups, oar scored by decades) avoid generic abstraction. The synthesis of creative despair with tidal imagery creates coherent originality. Slight deduction for the meta-fictional frame being somewhat familiar in literary fiction.</comment>
