<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and layered—personal ambition intertwined with communal need for "portable peace." Her olfactory sensitivity drives specific perceptual choices throughout. The final renunciation (keeping the seed unplanted) carries visible cost, though some interior passages lean toward abstract wisdom rather than embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through scent layers toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "the seed had already sprouted inside everyone willing to breathe alongside motion." The cost is conceptually felt through the village's transformation from fear to acceptance. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The treetop village functions as both setting and constraint, forcing Liora's descent to the mangroves. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("resinous stories she could nearly read with her nose"). The environment directly shapes the choice to plant below rather than above, charging the final image of the village swaying "anchored to some unseen root."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cultivating portable peace) faces meaningful opposition from the elders' fear. The tension tightens when Liora must germinate outside the village, forcing a trade-off between proximity and purpose. Cost is visible in the transformation of both Liora and the village, though escalation could intensify further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "serenity within motion" without explicit moralizing. The corpse flower's transformed scent—"nostalgic compost of storms becoming fields"—offers a non-literal answer about accepting movement rather than forcing stillness. The final image of walking with rather than planting the seed resonates without stating its meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through olfactory focus ("every leaf's whisper and every blossom's sigh"). Voice modulates appropriately with emotional intensity, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("the tide's thought"). No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though some phrases edge toward overwriting ("dawn murmured beneath her," "saplight painted their faces"). Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple purposes. Minor register drift in peak moments ("the undercurrent of wisdom") but clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of a migrating village seeking "stillness yet refused to stand still" offers a fresh angle. The transformation of the corpse flower's notorious stench into medicine through acceptance is non-obvious. However, some elements feel template-adjacent (wise elder opposition, herbalist protagonist) without full transformation.</comment>
