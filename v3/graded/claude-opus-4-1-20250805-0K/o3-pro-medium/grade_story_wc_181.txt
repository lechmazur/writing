<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The curator's internal contradictions between scientific method and philosophical inquiry create genuine tension, particularly in the bathroom breakthrough sequence. His transformation from bewilderment to stewardship reads as earned through specific embodied moments (frost crystallizing as punctuation marks). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "nonlinear inheritance" that occasionally drifts from embodied experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure where "Silence, at last, had inherited him" reweights the entire premise with visible cost (becoming footnotes in someone else's story). The pattern of temporal paradox is taught early and pays off through the apprentice vision. Slight deduction for abstract moments mid-story that momentarily blur the causal chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The astral orchard functions as both setting and constraint, with optical roots and pale trees actively shaping the curator's choices. Environmental details like "frost crystallizing into punctuation marks" and "pollen that coated his lungs" directly constrain action and charge the final image. The pistachio shell cameo serves as micro-setting that drives the central choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as the curator moves from passive observation to active participation, with clear cost in becoming "footnotes in someone else's first chapter." The dominant stake (accessing forbidden knowledge) tightens when he realizes knowledge demands irreversible participation. Minor deduction for some abstract passages that slightly dilute the pressure mid-story.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of "nonlinear inheritance" emerges organically through concrete images (futures parenting the past, memories forming in advance) rather than stated morals. The final realization that "silence had inherited him" offers a resonant non-literal answer to the central question. Strong integration of temporal paradox with character arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and inventive imagery ("almond-sized stars drip light"). The perceptual signature remains consistent through pressure, though occasional drift into elevated register ("brightened disquiet felt sustainable") slightly exceeds the curator's established lexicon. Strong use of free indirect style.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specific imagery, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("nonlinear inheritance," "simply complicated paradox") and some register drift into philosophical abstraction reduce immediacy. The "brightened disquiet" phrase appears twice, creating minor repetition. Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple layers.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time paradox with botanical imagery creates an original world-logic where memories can form backwards and stories pollinate light. The concept of a cameo that records unspoken thoughts "between the first and last page of a life" shows genuine ingenuity. Risk-taking in the temporal structure heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
