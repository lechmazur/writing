I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern accumulation (luminance, birds, hopscotch) toward a resonant discovery that reweights meaning.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aleksei's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his obsessive pattern-seeking through embodied actions (kneeling, brushing grit, noting squares). His "sociable isolation" manifests beautifully in befriending objects and phenomena. The final choice to trust the hopscotch map shows earned progression, though internal contradiction could be sharper during the discovery sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from curiosity through pattern recognition to validated discovery. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as the hopscotch board transforms from children's game to navigational key, with clear cost (risking the ship's course on untested theory). Who/where/when anchored immediately, lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The airship setting actively constrains and enables choices - the deck's hopscotch board becomes discoverable only in this liminal space. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("starling murmurations," "stranded luminance," "percolating chicory"). The floating isle of mist pays off the established luminance pattern, though some descriptions edge toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to risking the ship's navigation on Aleksei's theory. The captain's trust becomes the crucible that forces commitment. Cost is visible when they "stoke engines" and change course based on chalk marks, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily once the decision is made.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the translation metaphor - maps, languages, and luminous patterns all become ways of reading the world. The polyglot's marginal note bridges centuries meaningfully. The final image of stepping onto "clouds solid with light" resonates without stating a moral, reweighting the entire journey's purpose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled lyricism ("ink dropped upon water," "threads of pale gold"). POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature strong in how Aleksei notices patterns others miss. Minor register elevation in places ("stellar grid," "astrolabe") slightly exceeds the apprentice's likely lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose has momentum with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density generally high, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("threads of pale gold flickered like abandoned lantern beams caught in cobwebs"). The "sociable isolation" paradox and several other phrases risk becoming ornamental rather than functional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The hopscotch-as-navigation concept offers genuine freshness, transforming a childhood game into cosmic cartography. The synthesis of birds, light, and chalk marks feels specific rather than generic. Risk-taking in the lyrical approach mostly succeeds, though safer middle choices appear in the resolution's tidiness.</comment>
