<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rook and Mira's motivations crystallize through concrete actions—his penny-rattling summons and her three-note whistle code—with their prison-forged friendship providing earned causality for their collaboration. The transformation from "vagrant penny poet" to "Cartographer of Cracks" to "stability masquerading as wreckage" shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor deduction for the crowd's arrival feeling slightly convenient despite the whistle's setup.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through library transformation—"rust flaking like old scabs to reveal gleaming steel beneath"—culminating in Resonant Reconfiguration where two architects smile at their bloom. The cost is visible in Mira's ex-inmate number stamps and the community's banned books. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rusted library functions as active setting that constrains and enables—squealing rungs, sagging beams propped by dictionaries, bullet holes leaking light that draws citizens. The transformation from decay to "planks...fish scales under astral lanterns" tracks causally with the inhabitants' imagination pressure. Setting literally rebuilds through language work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal shelter-building to community refuge creation, with the library's physical transformation tracking emotional/social change. The sirens provide external pressure while Rook's "Fear is an obedient architect" crystallizes the choice to build despite risk. Cost manifests in exposed vulnerability—ex-inmates revealing their status through library cards.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "blooming resistance" theme emerges through concrete action—words as structural support, pennies as promises, books as nails in dreamwood. The final image of "two architects of luminous fracture" reweights the opening's broken glass metaphor from damage to deliberate construction. Theme avoids abstraction through physical manifestation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"moon cleared the skyline, for that was the hour schedules dissolved." The metaphorical density ("molted personalities like husks") serves the accumulative pattern without obscuring clarity. Dialogue carries subtext effectively: "Tonight I'm stability masquerading as wreckage."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"rattling like a cage full of pennies and promises" combines sound, object, and theme. Some metaphor density in peak beats ("seeds...rooted in floorboards, prying up rot to birth green punctuation") but pattern-taught and purposeful. Clean propulsion throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The library-as-body metaphor and language-as-construction material offers fresh synthesis, though "words rebuild infrastructure" risks familiar territory. The twist of ex-inmates stamping prison numbers into library cards transforms expected rebellion narrative. Specific details like "three notes learned in confinement" elevate beyond template.</comment>
