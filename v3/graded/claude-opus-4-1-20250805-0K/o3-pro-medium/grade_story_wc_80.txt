I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and ritual acts toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Callum's motivation as "archeologist of abandoned dreams" manifests through concrete ritual acts of preservation, with his "stoically sensitive" nature creating genuine internal tension. The inherited inkwell's irony "stains his pocket" provides embodied contradiction. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "hush of night ignites inside him" construction that verges on emotional summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently as Callum's ritualistic documentation builds toward the Resonant Reconfiguration of him becoming "lighter" and imagining "a chorus of distant readers breathing again." The cost is felt through the exchange with the pavilion and his acceptance of burden. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 with who/where/when established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion functions as active setting that constrains choice through tidal timing and physical navigation ("brine erupts through tiles like trapped applause"). Sensory details like "barnacles as thick as fists" and "velvet and darkness" create lived-in specificity. The environment directly shapes his preservation method and charges the final image of "measuring distances between longing and stone."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from surveying to preserving dreams to discovering the lockbox's parallel attempt at preservation. The tidal clock creates genuine pressure ("drawbridge descending...minutes"). The pavilion's "resonance underfoot" and exchange of burden provides the meaningful deepening that reweights his role from observer to participant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" evolves from describing missing relatives to naming "geometry swallowing whole rooms" to becoming the braided silence of "generations." The final image of "dreams newly un-abandoned" offers a non-literal answer to preservation's purpose. Minor deduction for the slightly overt "archeologist of abandoned dreams" declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formality with distinctive constructions like "mist flares like a hushed blaze" and selective perception focused on structural/archaeological details. The perceptual signature of noticing "each groan of wood, each echo" establishes character-specific attention. Slight register elevation in "interlaced absence" description is voice-motivated but occasionally strains.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The irony stains his pocket like ink"). Some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("hush of night ignites inside him," "quiet conflagration") without clear pattern-teaching. Minor template cadence in the "One by one" sequence and "He + verb" constructions, though mostly varied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of preserving abandoned dreams through foundation repairs offers a fresh synthesis of archaeology and emotional preservation. The parallel discovery of someone else's preservation attempt creates genuine resonance. The specific ritual of doweling notes into pilings feels inevitable yet surprising. Slightly limited by the predictable "firm shore surveyor" archetype.</comment>
