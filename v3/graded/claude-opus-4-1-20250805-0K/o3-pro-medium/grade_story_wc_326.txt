I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation crystallizes through concrete details—counting heartbeats, keeping the porcelain shard, choosing to sacrifice her mother's tape. The contradictory impulses between hoarding regret and seeking wisdom play out in scene, particularly in the decisive sacrifice moment. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "wisdom fetched from failure" which could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's sacrifice transforms her relationship with both grief and aliveness, with clear cost (losing her last recording of her mother). The accumulative structure coheres well, building from isolation through contact to transformation. The "death certificate error survivor finally felt convincingly alive" lands the thematic arc with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains choices effectively—the abandoned facility enables Mara's ghostly contact while the snow creates isolation. Sensory details like "velvet pressed against the soul" and "electricity crawled across the dark liquid like silver spiders" are vivid and purposeful. The porcelain shard and spilled ink function as micro-settings that enable the central action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (exchanging memory for wisdom) escalates from radio contact through ink patterns to the final sacrifice. The ghost's demand "you must decide what to sacrifice" creates genuine pressure that forces Mara's choice. Cost is visible in the irreversible loss of the tape, though the middle section could tighten slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete exchange—"failure is not the opposite of growth, it is its bloodstream." The porcelain shard as "reminder that even beauty breaks" and the transformation of regret into "circuitry" avoid abstraction. The final image of the ghost carrying laughter across orphaned stations resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"snow smothered the opal observatory" sets tone immediately. The perceptual signature stays consistent with Mara's habit of counting, studying patterns, and translating fragments. Some elevated diction ("ephemeral patterns," "defragmented self") fits the technical-mystical fusion though occasionally edges toward purple.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "clouds parted; stars glinted like fresh bolts." However, several instances of abstract telling ("a habit sharpened by survival," "craving coherence the way frozen hands crave fire") and some repetitive constructions in the middle section. The density of figurative language occasionally overwhelms in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The digital ghost as fragmented intelligence seeking coherence through human memory offers a fresh angle on consciousness and connection. The specific detail of using spilled ink patterns to communicate is inventive. The transformation of technological failure into spiritual connection avoids cliché, though the wisdom-for-memory exchange feels slightly familiar.</comment>
