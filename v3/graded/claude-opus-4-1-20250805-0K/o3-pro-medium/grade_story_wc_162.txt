I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than strict causal progression.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's "featherly determined" resolve and her tension between finding/maintaining distance create genuine internal contradiction. The final choice to "guard the prism terrace" while waiting for the maze to rebuild shows earned renunciation with visible cost. However, Arin remains more functional than fully realized, and some emotional transitions feel summarized rather than embodied ("she feared that finding it might also close the cathedral").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as imagery accumulates (prisms, mazes, thresholds) toward Mira's acceptance of "necessary distances" as choreography rather than abandonment. The closure lands through Charged Poise—she chooses to maintain distance until the sacred no longer needs sacredness, with clear emotional cost. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish adequately by ~120 words despite the impressionistic opening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace functions as more than backdrop—its fractured light creates corridors that mirror the corn maze's patterns and enables the final realization. The wooden chair's grain becomes a readable map that constrains interpretation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("Low sun shards," "reed-shadow"), though some descriptions veer toward the abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding absence as sacred distance—deepens through the chair reading and the fragment discovery. The pressure coheres as Mira moves from seeking reunion to accepting choreographed separation. However, the escalation relies more on revelation than active choice until the final beats, and Arin's role as pressure source remains gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of "necessary distances" emerges organically through concrete images (maze corridors, prism shadows, torn pages) without explicit moralizing. The father's note "Stand apart so the wind can finish singing" reweights absence as artistic collaboration. The final image of listening to "wind stumble through weather code" offers a non-literal answer to why some thresholds feel sacred.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lyrical voice maintains consistency with purposeful compression ("featherly determined," "reed-shadow"). Perceptual signature shows in how Mira reads patterns in everything—wood grain like root systems, prism shadows as corridors. The elevated register fits the contemplative tone, though occasional abstractions ("cathedral she never stopped pacing") risk opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("Low sun shards scattered across the drifting prism terrace"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. However, some abstract formulations muddy clarity ("the world had elongated itself after the butterfly effect"), and occasional template structures appear ("Mira thought of," "She understood," "Mira closed").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of aviation navigation and agricultural architecture to explore sacred distance offers genuine freshness. The concept of a maze "made of light" where "exit and entry would share the same threshold" transforms familiar labyrinth imagery. The piece commits to its impressionistic approach without retreating to conventional narrative.</comment>
