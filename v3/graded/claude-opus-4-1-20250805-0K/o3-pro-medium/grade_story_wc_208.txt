<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Iona's progression from lost navigator to conduit for timewoven alliances shows strong internal coherence, with her artistic sensibility ("perpetually learning from wood grain and tide rhythms") naturally extending to interpret temporal layers. The acceptance of her role as emissary feels earned through her craftsperson's understanding of balance and complexity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around the alliance concept that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through layered imagery (ships overlapping across time, the gate as "opened book") toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the gate allows villagers to "feel time loosen, then retie itself kindly." The cost is visible in Iona's labor ("Days bled into nights") and the transformation of her original commission into this temporal threshold. Slight weakness in the middle section where the alliance mechanics feel more explained than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The basalt archway and lighthouse constrain and enable key choices, with the magic lantern's beam creating the projection space that drives the central discovery. Exceptional integration of setting as active agent—the cove that "pivoted," the driftwood arranged in "serpentine patterns that felt deliberate." The gate's physical construction from specific materials (pale logs, kelp ropes) that mirror the archway creates resonant spatial logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation works through accumulative deepening: from disorientation to discovery to understanding to creation, with each layer adding complexity ("timewoven alliances," "compacts that allowed different eras to share resources"). The stakes crystallize when Iona accepts her role as emissary and commits to creating the gate. Cost is legible in the extended labor and transformation of purpose, though the middle section could use more immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of "scaffold complexity with simplicity" emerges organically through Iona's artistic practice extending to temporal interpretation, with the gate serving as physical manifestation of this principle. The final image of villagers stepping through to experience time's kindly retying offers a non-literal answer to how different eras might cooperate. Strong integration without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("tasting salt like punctuation on her lips," "linear hours into braided ones") that maintains coherence through the fantastical elements. Some register elevation in the alliance section ("compacts that allowed different eras to share resources") that slightly diverges from Iona's artistic POV. The prose rhythm effectively modulates between discovery and creation phases.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("timewoven alliances," "scaffold complexity with simplicity" appearing multiple times). Some mild redundancy in the alliance explanation section. The opening and closing images are particularly strong, with good momentum through most beats despite occasional density that slows reading.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-travel and craft artistry, with the magic lantern projection becoming a means to literally see and shape temporal overlays. The transformation from delivery mission to creating a permanent temporal gateway shows genuine ingenuity. The specific detail of different era crews (oilskin sailors and neon-vest engineers) conversing adds originality to what could have been generic time-blending.</comment>
