<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silva's motivation to understand why people echo drives a credible arc from canyon singer to memory mediator, with her acceptance of carrying others' memories showing genuine cost ("reed-blown melancholy fluttered through her ribs"). The merchant's vanishing and the shell's countdown create effective pressure, though some transitions between emotional states could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered echoes, memories, and the final pact that reweights Silva's role. The closure lands with clear cost—Silva must now carry memories "none of her own" in every performance. The countdown mechanism and descending journey provide clean causality, though the negotiation scene could be slightly more dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The canyon-as-resonance-chamber and the underground chamber "shaped like overlapping petals" effectively constrain choices and enable the story's logic. Sensory details like "moon-bleached flats" and "harmonics too quiet for ordinary travelers" create atmosphere while the shell's warmth and phosphorescence provide tactile anchoring. The setting literally shapes the resolution through its acoustic properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The countdown creates urgency that escalates from ten to zero, forcing Silva's journey and descent. The pact negotiation shows clear trade-offs: freedom from "involuntary resonance" for others versus Silva carrying chosen memories herself. Cost is visible in the final performance where she releases grief "half grief, half release" with permanent change to her vocation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of memory as communal burden emerges organically through the canyon's physics—"echoes were not merely sounds returning but memories seeking mouths." The final image of "grateful silence" replacing stolen voices delivers resonant closure without moralizing. The piece explores how some people become vessels for collective memory with genuine complexity about the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with lyrical compression ("orphan ghosts," "moon-bleached flats") and controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. POV remains stable with Silva's perceptual signature as someone who reads sound. Some passages lean toward elevated register ("serpentine nexus," "communal well") but generally maintain coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, though some figurative density approaches overwriting ("orphan ghosts between stone walls," "webs of intrigue from whispered secrets"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in the middle section ("Silva realized... That was why... To ensure") detracts slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of a canyon singer who reads echoes as trapped memories offers fresh specificity, transforming the familiar journey-to-underworld trope through acoustic physics. The negotiation with an intelligence that communicates through "stillness rather than speech" and the final transformation of Silva's art show genuine originality. The shell countdown mechanism adds unique pressure.</comment>
