I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the narrator accepts custodianship of the living archive.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's transformation from detached archivist to "sworn custodian" is earned through concrete engagement with the locket's magic. Internal conflict between professional distance ("walnut-ink archivist") and personal involvement crystallizes in the choice to write the proxy note. The widow's characterization through "haunted euphoria" and minimal dialogue effectively pressures the narrator's stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator accepts permanent custodianship ("I understood that meant always"). The cost is visible - carrying the weight of collective memory and responsibility for renewal. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building from documentation to participation to guardianship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "blooming jetty at twilight" with scattered petals creates immediate atmosphere. The locket's warmth "warmer than twilight should allow" and the pier smelling "of childhood soup" ground the magical realism. The regenerating photograph with its shifting grain provides crucial constraint on the narrator's final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional documentation to moral responsibility when the photograph reveals the undelivered letter. The narrator's proxy delivery ("I slid my note over the photograph") demonstrates agency with immediate consequence ("the pocket flattened"). Cost is legible in accepting perpetual duty: "Carry it only when context changes."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The covenant's transformation from "mythic mercy from waves" to "a contract among neighbors" reframes the entire premise. The undelivered letter as generational failure ("hoping someone else would speak first") resonates through the narrator's intervention. The final image of the "vigilant dove" between ribs perfectly captures the burden of witness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through "walnut-ink archivist" lexicon and measured, archival tone. The widow's sparse dialogue ("Each time someone names their fault, the picture heals") carries crucial subtext. Perceptual signature strong: "scattering petals like shy confetti," "haunted euphoria," maintaining consistency under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative imagery ("salt met perfume," "sand[ing] sharp edges into polish"). Some density issues in middle sections with abstract phrasing ("context changes were recorded instead of resisted"). Minor filter verb clustering ("I realized," "I asked," "I understood") dulls immediacy in spots but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The living photograph that changes based on collective forgiveness offers fresh angle on memory and accountability. The specific detail of the wax seal bearing "a wave embracing a seedling" creates originality through particulars. The covenant requiring active renewal rather than passive grace transforms familiar redemption themes.</comment>
