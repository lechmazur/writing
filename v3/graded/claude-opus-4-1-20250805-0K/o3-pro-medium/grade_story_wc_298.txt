<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and consistent—trading her destiny for her sister's—with embodied emotion in trembling hands and "raw but resolute" sobs. The internal conflict between self-sacrifice and self-preservation plays out through concrete choices (selecting seeds, accepting the ballast). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("fiercely gentle stubbornness") and occasional emotional labeling rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear closure—Liora successfully trades destinies, accepting both the gift and its ballast cost. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost: "herself, older, scarred, wandering empty wards because no dream guided her footsteps." Orientation anchors (catacomb, Liora descending, seeking the Keeper) establish clearly by ~100 words. The "bruise" metaphor and seed-swallowing create coherent pressure that builds to the trade's completion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard vividly constrains choice—roots "like veins of onyx," trees rising from "skull-studded soil," apples that whisper. Setting directly enables the story's mechanics (the orchard as destiny market). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric ("dust curdled in lantern beams"). Minor deduction for some abstract descriptors and limited exploration of how the specific environment shapes Liora's tactics beyond the central trade.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate clearly: from offering the card, to surrendering her dreamed futures, to accepting the hollow ballast. The dominant stake (saving Mira) faces genuine cost when Liora sees "herself, older, scarred, wandering empty wards." Agency drives the resolution through Liora's choices. Minor deduction because the Keeper's role is somewhat passive—more facilitator than active opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the burned tarot card, seeds as futures, the orchard as a place where "destinies could be bartered." The final image of "dusky resolve bloomed anew, fragile yet alive" resonates without stating a moral. The story explores sacrifice and renewal through specific imagery. Slight deduction for occasionally abstract phrasing ("patch holes in the soul") that could be more grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct narrative voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("fiercely gentle," "dusky resolve"). POV remains stable with Liora throughout. Dialogue between Liora and the Keeper carries subtext and advances the trade. Some elevated diction occasionally strains against naturalism ("trammel even her heartbeat"), and filter constructions appear but don't overwhelm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful imagery. Information density is good—most lines advance story or atmosphere. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("inlaying meaning everywhere" appears twice), some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete, and elevated diction that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies ("trammel" used twice).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard as destiny market offers a fresh angle on sacrifice narratives. Specific details (seeds as mirrors, apples that whisper, the ballast seed) create originality. The transformation of the tarot card element and the dual-seed resolution avoid predictable paths. Some familiar fantasy tropes (mysterious keeper, magical bargain) prevent higher scoring.</comment>
