I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ellis's reticent nature manifests through concrete actions (speaking through "trims of his wake," containing his wish to speak) with contradictory impulses acting in scene when he accepts the dangerous glass despite his caution. The final choice to embrace protective silence is earned through prior causality with visible cost—his isolation. Minor deduction for Marla and Joel remaining somewhat functional despite their stated purpose as pressure points.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (darkness/light, silence/speech) building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Ellis accepts his role as guardian. The closure lands with felt cost—his continued isolation in exchange for others' safety—crystallized in "That was enough talking for one night." The cairn-to-glass-to-lamp causal chain holds, though the magical realism elements strain slightly without fuller grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting constrains choices effectively—the vertical climb forces commitment, the circular room traps occupants with darkness. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("ink-black," "lavender of age," "distant citrus"). The sea glass's green glow and the Fresnel lens pedestal serve as micro-settings that enable the resolution, though some spatial choreography in the lamp room could be clearer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting against encroaching darkness—escalates from physical (extinguished lamp) through supernatural (haunted presence) to existential (chain letter tradition). Ellis's agency drives the resolution through his stone-stacking reply and naming of the glass. The cost is legible: accepting permanent guardianship. Minor deduction for the supernatural threat remaining somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between silence and communication, crystallized in Ellis's stone messages and final embrace of protective quiet. The sea glass chain letter tradition offers a non-literal answer about how safety travels through anonymous networks. "Anchors know both falling and holding" resonates without stating a moral. The ending reweights his reticence as protective rather than isolating.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ellis's selective perception filters everything through maritime knowledge ("trims of his wake," "invisible rigging"). Voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity—terse during action, expanding during reflection. The prose maintains a distinct nautical texture without becoming overwrought. Minor deduction for Marla and Joel's voices being less distinguished, though their limited dialogue makes this acceptable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The tide rolled ink-black along the breakwater when Ellis Moor cut the engine" establishes time, atmosphere, and character arrival). Some figurative density in peak beats ("luminescent ache in his ribs," "breath inside someone else's lungs") without full payoff. Template cadence appears briefly ("Ellis realized... He felt... He stayed...") but doesn't pervade.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The stone-message system as secret maritime communication offers fresh specificity beyond typical lighthouse haunting tales. The chain letter tradition through sea glass rather than paper transforms a familiar concept through concrete nautical detail. The synthesis of protective silence with necessary communication feels earned, though the magical elements could push further from convention.</comment>
