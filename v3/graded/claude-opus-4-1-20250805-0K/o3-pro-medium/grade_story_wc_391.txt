I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece. The story builds through layered imagery and cadence shifts rather than causal plot mechanics, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the viaduct's activation represents a conceptual shift from impatience to patience.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's transformation from "impatience, once a constant inner drum" to understanding "promises stretch; borders stop" shows genuine internal movement with embodied cost. The horizon mapper demonstrates consistent purposefulness through concrete actions like tapping ice with a tuning fork. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around the revolution concept that lacks full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when the viaduct activates and "the light did not explode; it unfolded, slow as moss, unyoking me from urgency." The cost is felt through the narrator's shifted understanding and commitment to "rechart every impatient road." Orientation anchors (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, annual meeting) establish cleanly by line 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The viaduct functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its magnetic properties and alignment requirements drive the central action. Strong sensory work: "ice thick as glass spun for giants," "lantern breathing small gold onto the snow." The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake create atmospheric pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation builds through density increase from abstract concept ("patient revolution") to concrete engineering (planting copper rods, measuring azimuths) to transformation (viaduct blazing). The deepening from theoretical to embodied change narrows the narrator's options with visible cost in their vow to "rechart every impatient road."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of patience as revolution, earned through concrete action rather than stated. "Promises stretch; borders stop" crystallizes the thematic insight through embodied realization. The final image of the viaduct "singing behind us" with "restrained wildness" offers a non-literal answer to how change operates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "Snow muted the world," "bruised dusk," "iron filings into patterns like prayer stones." Some elevated diction occasionally strains POV consistency ("vigilant horizon mapper," "conscripted"). Dialogue carries subtext effectively: "a patient revolution" functions as action not exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Information density generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs. However, abstract phrasing clusters appear: "tent of silence erected over us," "caravans of thought from the ruts imposed by centuries." Some conceptual redundancy around the patience/impatience dynamic. Prose rhythm varies effectively but occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of engineering precision with mystical transformation—tracking moon paths to reprogram societal urgency. The magnetic viaduct as consciousness-altering infrastructure shows genuine originality. Risk-taking in the conceptual premise pays off through specific embodiment, though some elements feel slightly derivative of speculative fiction tropes.</comment>
