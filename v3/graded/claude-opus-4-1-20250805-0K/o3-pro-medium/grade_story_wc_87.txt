I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through imagery, metaphor, and pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration where Gideon accepts Marina's offer to "steer while she minds the stars."

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Gideon's internal contradiction between navigator expertise and current incapacity drives authentic choices, particularly his shift from celestial to utility pole navigation. The "merrily melancholic whistle" and paddling as "spinning smile" embody complex emotional states without diagnostic labels. Marina's presence provides crucible pressure that forces Gideon's acceptance of shared navigation, though her characterization remains thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost: Gideon accepts Marina's offer to share navigation duties, acknowledging his limitations while the "backlash of regrets grew quieter." The accumulative structure builds through water/navigation imagery toward this reconfigured relationship. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, though the lightning strike feels slightly convenient despite its thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The utility poles function as micro-setting that constrains choice—Gideon navigates by them instead of stars, and their power line metaphor ("Energy flowed unseen between shore and shore") charges the closure. The barnacles' "silver tears" and storm's choreography create atmospheric pressure, though some description trends ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from launch hesitation through storm crisis to dock arrival, with the lightning strike forcing Gideon's apology to the void. The dominant stake—whether Gideon can navigate across the bay despite his trauma—tightens when the poles "march sideways" and the compass points "straight down." Cost is visible in the drowned deckhands' ghosts and Gideon's trembling arrival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The navigation metaphor deepens from literal (crossing the bay) to relational (Marina steering while Gideon's stars steady), avoiding explicit moralizing. The utility poles as "ordinary beacons for a man wary of celestial lies" reweight navigation from grand to humble. Marina's stone-skipping wisdom—"The stone must spin and smile at water or it just sinks"—emerges naturally from memory to inform present action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent maritime lexicon ("charted oceans," "navigator," "deckhands") with controlled metaphorical density. The "merrily melancholic" register holds through "uneasy bark" and paddling rhythm. Marina's dialogue carries appropriate warmth and authority, though limited presence prevents full voice distinction. Some filter verbs ("he imagined," "he realized") slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of excellence ("barnacles drip silver tears," "whistle slipped through Gideon's teeth") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("erected the backlash of regrets") and abstract phrasing ("gravitating toward love"). The lightning sequence maintains propulsion, though some metaphors strain ("drunken soldiers deserting their posts"). Information density generally strong with minimal scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The shift from celestial to utility pole navigation offers fresh specificity within the maritime guilt narrative. The compass pointing "straight down, accusing the depths" transforms a navigation tool into judgment device. Risk-taking in the extended metaphorical framework mostly succeeds, though occasionally tips toward overelaboration.</comment>
