I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's compulsion to follow the lens despite forty years of cautious undertaking reads as genuinely contradictory impulse acting in scene, particularly his "inadvertently stubborn streak anchored his hands." The final choice to remain below carries visible cost ("no resignation, only the calm of a singed wick willingly drowning itself"), though the transition from pragmatic undertaker to sacrificial keeper could use one more beat of internal resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—Elias's choice to remain as keeper forecloses return with clear cost ("something living had to remain behind"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the final reconfiguration where the library transforms from repository of ignored pleas to proper resting place. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient mechanics of the underwater transition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater library with "shelves of coral-encrusted tomes glowing with bioluminescent script" constrains Elias's choices and enables the resolution. The broken lens functions as micro-setting that drives action. Deduction for some generic harbor imagery early and the somewhat abstract "stairwell of air" that could be more physically grounded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity through discovering the library's purpose ("every distress signal ever ignored") to the realization that balance requires sacrifice. The pressure coheres well under the accumulative lens as understanding deepens. The cost is unmistakable: Elias must remain to free the trapped signals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the lens transforming "from warning to welcome" resonates as the story explores how unacknowledged grief builds its own architecture. The final image of Elias as keeper between "shelves and sea" offers a non-literal answer about the necessity of witness. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract "grief had built its own architecture."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm, particularly in "Rain hammered the cracked harbor stones" and the measured cadence throughout. The perceptual signature shows in details like hearing "clicking, like distant distress signals." Some register elevation in phrases like "chased stillness" and "inadvertently stubborn" that slightly strain the undertaker's voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears: "soaked twine," "chased stillness," "smeared under the glass like drowned constellations." The metaphor density in high-pressure beats ("singed wick willingly drowning itself") occasionally obscures rather than clarifies. Information density is strong with most lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of an underwater library cataloging ignored distress signals offers a fresh angle on grief and witness. The transformation of the lighthouse lens from warning device to welcoming beacon shows genuine ingenuity. The specific synthesis of undertaker-as-final-keeper feels earned, though some elements (octopus librarians) lean toward expected fantastical tropes.</comment>
