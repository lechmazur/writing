I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor for a prestigious literary publication.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) - The story combines causal progression (experiment → connection → intrusion → disconnection) with accumulative textural elements (light patterns, sensory details, technological imagery). Judge closure under the causal lens dominant at the end.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's "affectionate skeptic" stance drives consistent choices through the telepathy experiment, with internal contradiction between scientific rigor and emotional openness playing out in scene. The final defensive maneuver against NeuroScribe intrusion shows earned agency with visible cost (severing connection). Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("charmingly inconvenient") and slight emotional tidiness in resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) - the corporate intrusion forces tactical withdrawal with clear cost (abandoning breakthrough discovery). Causal chain holds: experiment → success → intrusion → protective disconnection. The "willowglass hope" that "bent but never broke" reweights at closure with "possibility still flickered," showing resilience under threat. Deduction for slightly soft cost articulation - the price of disconnection could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The light painting studio functions as active setting - shutters respond to biometrics, creating visual manifestations of telepathic connection. Muscovite geode serves as "lightning rod" constraining the telepathic channel. Strong sensory specificity ("citrus and graphite on the palate"). Minor deduction for some generic tech descriptions and underutilized spatial possibilities during the intrusion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from scientific curiosity to validated discovery to corporate threat requiring protective action. The intrusion ("metallic and cold") forces immediate tactical shift to "protocol two." Cost is visible but could be sharper - we see disconnection but the full price of abandoning the experiment lacks visceral weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of illumination versus eclipse emerges through concrete action - literal light patterns reveal mental pathways, then darkness becomes necessary protection. The "willowglass hope" metaphor effectively bridges skepticism and wonder. Final image of possibility "waiting for the light to resume" resonates without moralizing. Slight deduction for occasionally precious phrasing ("fractally precise spirals").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Liora's voice maintains consistent scientific precision mixed with poetic observation ("stippled like moon skin"). Telepathic dialogue feels natural with subtext ("let's measure before we marvel"). Minor issues with register elevation in places ("somatic markers") that slightly exceeds character lexicon during emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Several instances of overwriting detract: "fractally precise" appears twice, some purple patches ("iridescent hush," "willowglass hope"), and occasional template phrasing ("I, Liora the affectionate skeptic"). The "citrus and graphite" sensory detail is precise but some metaphors strain ("moon skin").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of telepathy-as-data-visualization with light painting creates original framework. The biometric-triggered shutters translating thought into visual patterns is inventive. Corporate surveillance angle on telepathic breakthrough adds contemporary relevance. Loses some points for familiar "skeptic convinced by experiment" arc, though execution elevates the premise.</comment>
