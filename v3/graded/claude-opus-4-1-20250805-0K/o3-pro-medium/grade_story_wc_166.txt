<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable's motivation is consistently rooted in her identity as a banned artist seeking to inscribe the world itself, with the moonstone memory creating genuine internal tension between risk and necessity. The choice to dissolve the relic on her tongue shows clear agency under pressure with visible stakes. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "choreographing emotion into stepwise ebb" that briefly moves away from embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Sable transforms from exile to "origin," having successfully inscribed her cosmic verse on the world with felt cost (exhaustion, risk of discovery). The moonstone dissolution serves as the pivotal intensification that enables the final transformation. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "poem circulating in every vein of earth," though the cost and reconfiguration remain legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The twilight garden functions as both physical setting and constraint—Sable is "spontaneously anchored" here, unable to wander farther, making it the necessary stage for her work. The moonstone cabochon dust speck serves as micro-setting that directly enables the climactic inscription. The sensory details ("dew into black loam," "smelled of dusk and salt") are filtered through Sable's tide-dancer perception, and the environment actively shapes her final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—inscribing forbidden art despite the nostalgia ban—intensifies through the moonstone discovery and dissolution, which risks "drowning in recollection" but enables the cosmic verse. The escalation from finding the relic to absorbing it to successfully inscribing the world shows clear deepening under the accumulative lens. Cost is visible in exhaustion and the irreversible transformation of becoming "origin, not oubliette."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of art's persistence despite censorship emerges through concrete action—the moonstone crystallizing where "unresolved memories tried to condense into matter" and Sable's verse infiltrating "every vein of earth." The final transformation from exile to origin offers a resonant answer about creative resistance. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in how the poem's effects manifest ("chimneys inhaled brackish night").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyric register appropriate to Sable's artist-exile status, using phrases like "fledge new senses" and "obsidian grace" that feel character-specific. The perceptual signature focuses on negative space ("find form by observing gaps") consistent with her tide-dancer training. No dialogue to evaluate, but the internal voice maintains consistency even under the pressure of the moonstone dissolution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("moonstone cabochon dust speck balanced on its palm"), but several instances of abstract phrasing that reduce immediacy: "choreographing emotion into stepwise ebb," "gravity came from chosen purpose." Some elevated diction borders on purple prose in places ("with obsidian grace she lifted"). The sentence-level propulsion remains strong despite these moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of censorship narrative with tide-dancing as banned art form, and the specific innovation of nostalgia crystallizing into physical matter. The concept of inscribing verse on "mortal skin" of the planet itself offers a non-obvious angle. The risk of using highly lyrical, almost mythic register pays off in creating a unique texture, though it occasionally tips toward abstraction.</comment>
