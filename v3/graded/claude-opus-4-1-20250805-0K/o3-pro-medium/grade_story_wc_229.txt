<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Milo's motivation to prove whispers' power over shouts is clear and drives concrete action through the vial experiment. The internal consistency holds well, though the philosophical bent occasionally abstracts the emotional stakes. The final realization about "screaming tenderness" lands with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens governs effectively as sensory details (jasmine, cork vibrations, bell note) build toward proving the whisper's superiority. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the bell confirms the theory, with conceptual cost implied through "unshouting faith." The experimental setup creates genuine tension despite the quiet stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, night-blooming garden, and harbor market create a vivid maritime world that constrains the experiment's parameters. Sensory details like "jasmine fragrance rose in soft columns" effectively merge setting with thematic intent. The environment actively participates in the proof through scent-as-telegraph.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther—escalates through methodical preparation, the synchronized release of both signals, and the waiting for confirmation. The bell's response before the horn's echo provides decisive resolution with implied philosophical cost about the nature of communication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the experiment itself: kindness and gentleness achieve what force cannot. The final lines "Proof is simply kindness measured against distance / And kindness, once vibrating, never stops" avoid moralizing by staying grounded in the physical experiment's vocabulary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with distinctive phrases like "wonders accumulate when nobody is looking, like sand in pockets." POV remains stable with Milo's philosophical bent coloring perception throughout. Some moments edge toward purple prose but stay voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("expression of screaming tenderness," "enormity of caring"). Information density remains high with most sentences advancing both plot and atmosphere. Some metaphorical density in peak moments risks opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise of testing whispered intentions against amplified sound offers genuine freshness. The integration of maritime setting with metaphysical experiment feels organic. The "driftwood cork purifies intentions" concept and garden-as-telegraph system show imaginative world-building.</comment>
