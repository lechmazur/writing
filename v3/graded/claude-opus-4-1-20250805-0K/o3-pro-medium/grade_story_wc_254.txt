<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cloud-shadow poet demonstrates clear motivation through his aesthetic hunger for "an architecture of sensation" and his quest to test whether truth still resonates after censorship. The narrator's parallel urge to "stride through boundaries once thought sacred" creates authentic internal resonance. Minor deduction for the poet's characterization leaning slightly toward archetype in places, though his breath-sketching and specific actions ground him sufficiently.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through breath-stanzas, walking meditation, and the colonnade's emergence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the hum transforms collective certainty. The cost is legible in "shoulders loosening as if heavy cloaks were unfastened" and the permanent alteration of the city's sonic landscape. Orientation anchors (poet, frozen lake, post-ban winter) establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium's twilight-storing panes, frozen lake as mirror, and buried quartz colonnade all constrain choices and charge the final image where "certainty trembled in welcome." The humming stone guides their path and the columns' emergence from beneath market stalls creates tactile transformation. Setting actively shapes both journey and resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: breath-poems → stone's pulse → three-day journey → columns rising → collective transformation. The dominant stake of testing whether authentic expression can survive censorship tightens as the columns respond only to truth, forcing the city to confront its post-ban tremor. Cost manifests in the dissolution of old boundaries and the vulnerability of newfound resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image of certainty as tremor—not weakness but rhythm for change—paid off when "certainty trembled in welcome." The colonnade's requirement for truth, the moth-hush that signals deep listening, and the final shared resonance all develop organically without moralizing. The ending reweights the entire journey as necessary preparation for collective transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm ("glassed the northern provinces," "lantern-moth hush") and purposeful compression that teaches its pattern early. The poet's dialogue carries philosophical weight naturally ("where sound risked falling off the map"). Perceptual signature strong in how the narrator notices breath becoming visible verse and twilight stored like coals.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Night settled, but cobalt panes above us stored twilight like blue coals" manages time, setting, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops or scaffolding detected. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm supporting the accumulative structure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of censorship aftermath, synaesthetic poetry, and geological resonance creates a non-obvious meditation on how truth persists through suppression. The breath-stanzas and humming quartz avoid cliché through specific execution. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and the abstract concept of "certainty trembling" heightens stakes (+0.3 within band).</comment>
