Looking at this story through an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through resonant images and vibrations rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris's deafness creates genuine contradictory impulses—seeking music through bone-deep vibration while fighting emotional numbness. Her choice to "share the silence, do not hoard" earns the final transformation with visible cost: tears, unclenched fists, awakened hearts. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("emotional numbness" repeated as label) but the embodied perception of vibration as "thunderous within her bones" and "trembling constellations" grounds the character effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly—silence becomes eloquent communication, numbness transforms to feeling through shared vibration. The cost manifests in "tears shape themselves along cheeks starved for salt" and the community's physical release. Orientation anchors effectively (cavern, autumn, Maris). Deduction for some causality softness in the middle (how exactly does playing backward transform the drums?) but the accumulative pattern coheres at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cavern functions as resonant chamber, its "subterranean heartbeat" and stone walls answering with echoes directly enable the transformation. Sensory detail excels: "cedar, pitch, and long-held echo," vibrations as "trembling constellations." The drums and phonograph needle constrain choices meaningfully. Minor deduction for some abstract descriptors ("hollowed beneath ancient cliffs") but the tactile interaction with space elevates the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (defeating numbness to feel/make others feel) signals early and tightens through the discovery-attunement-sharing progression. The "filament of hush" measuring honesty creates genuine pressure. Cost appears in the community's physical/emotional release. Deduction for coincidence elements (drum maker conveniently gone, perfect setup waiting) and because the escalation relies more on accumulation than active choice, though this fits the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the paradox of "audibly muted" music creating profound connection. The recurring silence/sound inversion ("share the silence," "eloquent quiet") builds without stating morals. The final image of Maris carrying "her newly awakened heart as baton" resonates perfectly. Minor deduction for one instance of thematic directness ("she called it finally feeling") but overall the emergence feels organic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature: Maris experiences sound through bone conduction and vibration, creating unique sensory descriptions. The prose modulates effectively from quiet searching to resonant discovery. Deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't quite fit ("hieroglyphs of former storms," "migratory wings") and some POV uncertainty about what others experience, but the tactile perception of silence as substance works brilliantly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density varies—strong in sensory moments but diluted by abstract phrases and near-loops ("emotional numbness"/"defeat emotional numbness," "audibly muted" used 4x). Several elevated metaphors strain clarity ("filament of hush coiled," "starlight chipped from midnight glass"). The "Seek/play/follow" sequence and drum-tuning section maintain momentum. Template cadence appears in the middle catalog of actions ("She fitted...She reversed..."). Figurative density in peak beats without clear payoff triggers deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of a deaf music teacher using vibration and silence to create music offers genuine freshness. The "filament of hush" as physical/metaphysical element and backward-playing to unlock forward movement show creative synthesis. The specific synthesis of deafness-as-advantage for teaching pure feeling through vibration transcends typical disability narratives. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode pays off.</comment>
