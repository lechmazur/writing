I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern accumulation (fortunes, secrets, light) toward a resonant reconfiguration where classified information becomes public art.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's transformation from secret-hoarder to liberator is earned through concrete details ("Years of hoarding classified truths had constricted my breathing"). Jun Lao's characterization through his fortune-writing philosophy effectively drives the central choice. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("something unexpected loosening inside my chest") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where broadcasting secrets transforms their nature ("secrets are only cages we pretend are keys"). The accumulative lens holds as fortunes, light patterns, and secrecy motifs build toward the final "key change." Cost is visible in the protagonist's emptied pockets and released past life. Slight deduction for abstract phrasing in the final line.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting actively constrains choices through its architecture (spiral stairs, lantern room) and enables the broadcast mechanism. Vivid sensory work: "Wind scraped the rocky island like a file on bone." The modified lens assembly becomes crucial micro-setting. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("narrow windows").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal debt (Vienna theft) to global transformation (broadcasting secrets). The protagonist's agency drives the choice to participate despite years of training against disclosure. Cost is legible in releasing classified material and abandoning former life. Some abstract phrasing ("transprose life into a new key") slightly dulls impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the open secret paradox - information hidden in plain sight becomes liberation. The fortune cookie motif effectively reweights from cryptic messages to prophetic truths. Strong final image of breathing "the key of tomorrow" resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical register ("lighthouse that locals called the Throat"). POV maintains consistent access and knowledge. Dialogue between narrator and Jun effectively carries subtext about transformation. Some register elevation in peak moments ("accidentally prophetic") that slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Deductions for abstract phrasing loops ("accidentally prophetic" appears twice identically), some filter constructions ("I realized," "I felt"), and occasional purple patches ("moonlight wrung through glass").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spy thriller and philosophical meditation through the fortune cookie writer character. The concept of broadcasting secrets as light patterns shows genuine ingenuity. The transformation of espionage into art avoids genre clichés. Some familiar spy fiction elements (microdot specs, Vienna) prevent higher scoring.</comment>
