<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ithar's motivation to "navigate without moving" drives consistent internal choices, with embodied perception like "the canyon's hush settled into his ribs like silt." The revelation sequence shows contradictory impulses between mastery and balance ("such power demanded balance"), earning the final renunciation to share rather than rule with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Ithar achieves his paradoxical goal then renounces dominance to share the knowledge. Cost is legible in "centuries of layered dust the lesson would travel" - the price of dispersal over control. The wandering pulse finding "a spine" through the arrowhead creates coherent pattern-break at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The canyon setting actively constrains and enables choices - its "trembling memory" teaches navigation, birds map "invisible hollows," and the bone towers create the echo chamber essential to the discovery. Environment literally becomes internalized ("the ledge stood within him"), making setting indispensable to both method and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking knowledge to testing devotion ("the canyon testing his devotion") to wielding reality-altering power, with the critical turn at "to navigate without moving was to persuade the world to move instead." The renunciation to share rather than rule shows clear agency with cost, though middle escalation could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge transmission across time emerges through concrete images - the wandering pulse seeking voice, birds mapping invisible spaces, instructions etched for "some future pilgrim." The ending reweights the opening's solitary quest into cyclical teaching without stating a moral, achieving resonance through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with selective noticing ("river-shale plates clattered softly, mirroring the crooked rhythm") and consistent lyric compression. Voice maintains mythic distance while grounding in sensory specifics like "tasting flint, river memory, and distant starlight."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Wind moaned between the towers of bone in a canyon of endless echoes" establishes setting, atmosphere, and acoustic properties). Some elevated diction ("historically reverent," "appraise") slightly strains but serves the mythic register. Clear propulsion through varied syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The paradox of "navigate without moving" offers a fresh angle on mystical knowledge, with specific synthesis through the canyon's acoustic properties and bird-mapping. The solution - persuading the world to move instead - feels earned through established particulars rather than convenient magic.</comment>
