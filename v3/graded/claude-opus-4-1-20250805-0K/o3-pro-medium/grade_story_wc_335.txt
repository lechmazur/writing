I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural** lens, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal linkage, with closure arriving through resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's backward-walking nervous habit manifests physically in confrontation with Harl, revealing character through embodied action. Rafe's geometric response to crisis shows learned resilience. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("combative tenderness") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration when the mirrors' testimony reverses exile, with visible cost in the severed warrant and narrator's choice to remain. The accumulative pattern of geometry, reflection, and reversal coheres at the ending. Slight dock for cost being more conceptual than visceral in the final moments.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library's architecture actively shapes action—backward navigation through stacks, mirrors locked in crates that later weaponize. The afternoon shadow caught in glass transforms from passive image to active blade. Setting constrains choices throughout and charges the final tea-reading image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating pressure: teaching resilience, Harl's arrival, the opened crate releasing weaponized shadows. The geometric circle Rafe traces redirects violence, showing agency. Cost is visible in the torn warrant, though the stakes could press harder on personal sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the geometry of resilience—angles that "remember what tongues forget," patterns of retreat as direction. The final image of learning "to sway back without breaking" resonates without stating a moral. Slight reduction for occasional abstraction ("combative tenderness") that verges on thematic labeling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled compression and lyric precision—"I pocketed that flicker daily, folding it like a bookmark." The backward-walking POV creates unique perceptual signature. Dialogue between Harl's sneering authority and the narrator's measured resistance carries subtext effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean, purposeful prose with high information density—each line advances atmosphere, character, or plot simultaneously. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. No loops or scaffolding detected. Figurative language serves rather than ornaments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archivist concept freshly synthesizes reflection, memory, and justice. Tea-leaf geometry as resilience training shows genuine originality. The reversal mechanism through mirrors testifying creates non-obvious resolution. Risk-taking in the lyric compression heightens rather than obscures (+0.3).</comment>
