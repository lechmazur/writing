<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's loneliness drives authentic micro-choices throughout, from seeking Milo to participating in the ritual. The "desperately jocular" trait manifests in concrete actions (octopi umbrella joke) that earn reciprocal connection. Minor deduction for some emotional summary ("Loneliness had taken root") rather than pure embodiment, though the final transformation lands with earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the communal rhythm scene. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as isolation transforms into "shared cadence" with visible cost (each carrying forward obligation to reciprocate). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3. The moon rock's resonance pattern teaches early and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ivy Station's decay and overgrowth constrains movement and creates intimacy around the lantern. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("ivy curtains parted," "rafters shed dust like confetti"). The moon rock's physical properties (dull until touched, then glowing) directly enable the cure. Minor deduction for some abstraction in setting transitions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (curing loneliness) accumulates pressure through gathering strangers, sharing manifests, and the moon rock ritual. Agency manifests as participation rather than traditional conflict. The cost is legible: accepting reciprocal obligation. Escalation could be sharper—the middle section drifts slightly before the ritual tightens focus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete logistics of human connection—manifests, supply drops, "attentive company seasoned with whimsy." The final image of rumor "hurrying ahead to arrange the next gathering" offers a non-literal answer about how connection propagates. Reciprocity theme is embodied in action rather than stated. Slight deduction for one instance of mild abstraction ("loneliness went to catch another train").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice with consistent whimsical register ("politely asking permission to creak," "courteous anarchy"). Dialogue carries subtext and character goals effectively. Minor filter verb clusters in middle section ("I realized," "I asked") slightly dull immediacy. The perceptual signature holds—everything filtered through a lonely comedian's sensibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with memorable phrases ("tomorrow negotiates with yesterday"). Information density is high in peak beats. Some paraphrase loops appear mid-story ("Milo was bound by reciprocity"/"promptly fulfilled the first clause"). Template cadence in the stranger arrival sequence. No artifacts touch the closure, which maintains propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of disaster logistics applied to emotional relief creates non-obvious angle. The moon rock as loneliness cure and the origami swallow manifest are specific inventions. "Polite anarchy" as organizing principle feels original. The transformation of rumor into connection infrastructure shows genuine ingenuity, though some middle beats follow expected patterns.</comment>
