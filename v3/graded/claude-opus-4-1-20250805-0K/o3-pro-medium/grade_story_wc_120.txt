<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to conduct unheard symphonies manifests through embodied actions (pressing shell to pane, raising imaginary baton) with clear internal contradiction between chronological homesickness and forward ambition. The final choice to gather elements and promise return shows earned endurance with visible cost ("the delicacy of inspiration was measured in breaths"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("chronologically homesick" relies on conceptual label rather than fully embodied experience).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the nautilus chambers form "a new measure" waiting for the next horizon. Cost is felt through "every ache in his lungs" and the fragility of inspiration "measured in breaths." Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors (who/where clear, but "when" emerges gradually through dawn progression).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass spire and frozen lake actively constrain choices through physical properties (wind on panes creates notes, frost traces spirals, ice cracks harmonize). The nautilus shell's chambers function as micro-setting that enables the symphony. Environment directly charges the final image of "panes still resonating" as Silas descends.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from listening to wind, to pressing shell against pane, to climbing the spire, to conducting the full symphony. The dominant stake (conducting unheard symphonies) tightens as "final echoes thinning" forces closure. Cost is legible in physical exhaustion and temporal limitation, though the piece could benefit from one sharper moment of trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of memory/time ("chronologically homesick"), art/perception (unheard symphonies), and hidden influence (fortune cookies as rehearsal marks). The final image of "a new measure...waiting for the next horizon to mirror it" offers resonant answer without stating moral. Strong integration of mirrored horizon as both literal phenomenon and thematic framework.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature throughout ("tentative fingertips," "small crescent rooms," "timid acrobats"). Rhythmic control modulates with scene pressure, accelerating during the conducting sequence. Voice maintains consistency through lyric compression without losing clarity. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "Snow began to fall, each flake catching the aurora...stamping it with prismatic applause" combines weather, time, and thematic resonance). Some elevated diction ("chronologically homesick," "bewildering symmetry") occasionally strains but remains within artistic voice. Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph lengths.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of conductor/glass architecture/hidden influence creates non-obvious angle on artistic creation. The concept of conducting symphonies only resonant surfaces can hear, funded through cryptic fortunes, shows genuine originality. Risk-taking in lyric structure and conceptual premise heightens stakes (+0.3 within band for unconventional coherence).</comment>
