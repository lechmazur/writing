<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ripple-Mark's motivation to find silence is clear and consistent, driving concrete choices through ice divination and echo-stone manipulation. The character's contradictory impulses emerge when trying to "bottle a gale" versus "guiding it," earning the final renunciation of leaving the stone behind. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("hammered repose") that lacks full embodiment in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through layered silence-seeking methods, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where "silence met silence" creates the bloom of hush. The cost is visible: the echo stone greys and must be left behind, while the mapkeeper continues deeper "ready to conjure more stillness." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The harmonic caves function as active setting, with flute-like pillars vibrating, frost-crusted walls cracking under ice examination, and the ceiling seam leaking stillness. Setting constrains choices through sound corridors and enables the solution via stalactite architecture. Sensory detail favors sound/vibration appropriately for the premise, though tactile elements could deepen certain beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding refuge from noise) established immediately and tightens through failed attempts with the echo stone before the crucial realization about "two silences pollinating." The cost manifests when the mapkeeper must leave the depleted echo stone behind and continue alone. Escalation follows the accumulative lens as pressure builds through "hours passed" and multiple failed techniques.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that "calm was not a destination but a rhythm one can redraw," earned through specific ice-reading and stone manipulation rather than assertion. The final image of walking deeper "ready to conjure more stillness" offers a non-literal answer about creation versus discovery. Subtext operates through the physical properties of tools (ice fractures, stone absorption) revealing deeper truths.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through cartographic terminology ("ripple-mark," "tidal charts," "topographies") and sensory focus on vibration/resonance. Voice maintains consistency through specialized lexicon like "examining crack patterns in ice" and "cave-moth wing vellum." Minor register elevation in places ("hammered repose") slightly exceeds the POV's established range but doesn't break coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines like "The harmonic caves rang with spent thunder, yet a hush like beaten metal settling over an anvil held the air in hammered repose" doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in opening creates mild opacity, and occasional abstract phrasing ("bloom of hush") recurs without always advancing pressure. Sentence variety and rhythm support the accumulative build effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound-mapping through ice divination offers a fresh angle on the silence-seeking premise, with specific tools (echo chamber stone, river ice shard) creating non-obvious solutions. The concept that silence requires "two silences pollinating" transforms expected resolution. Risk-taking through the specialized cartographic voice and accumulative structure heightens coherence without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
