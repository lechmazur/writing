I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows a clear because/therefore chain from discovery of the nut through blueprint assembly to labyrinth reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's reluctant acceptance and hidden vow create genuine internal contradiction, with her "offhandedly exact" actions revealing character through gesture rather than declaration. The progression from passive caretaker to active guide feels earned through concrete discovery and assembly sequences. Minor deduction for some emotional smoothness during the high-stakes labyrinth navigation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from nut discovery through dream blueprint to labyrinth reconfiguration, with clear cost in risk and effort. The closure lands as Decisive Change - the labyrinth transforms from trap to guide, saving the miners. The "who/where/when" anchors clearly by line 4, and the frost deadline creates genuine urgency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard's amber resin, mechanical birds' "brass wings creak," and the labyrinth's "salt and rust" smell create vivid sensory grounding. Setting actively constrains choices through the frost deadline and cliff geography. The amber light interaction with bird optics shows environment as tool, though some passages lean toward catalog description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from orchard duty to discovering the blueprint to racing the frost deadline. The mechanical birds shift from obstacle to redirected guardians through Liora's amber-light manipulation. Cost is visible in sweat, risk of falling, and the foreclosed possibility of failure once frost forms.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden guidance and reluctant heroism emerges through action rather than statement. The recurring motif of "leaving impressions without touching" resonates from the sigils through Liora's assembly method to her invisible caretaking. The ending achieves thematic resonance through "even the smallest husk can shelter a map home," though some passages edge toward explicit meaning-making.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third-person with distinctive perceptual signature - Liora notices mechanical details and patterns others miss. The prose rhythm accelerates during the labyrinth sequence with shorter, urgent sentences. Some filter verb accumulation ("she senses," "she realizes") slightly dulls immediacy in middle passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece well. Some synonym repetition around "graceless beauty" and occasional overwriting in descriptive passages ("wheel above its stone corridors" could be tighter).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fusion of mechanical birds as failed guardians with an organic curse creates fresh tension. The blueprint-in-a-nut discovery and amber-light bird manipulation show inventive problem-solving. However, the reluctant caretaker and cursed location are familiar tropes only partially transformed through specific detail.</comment>
