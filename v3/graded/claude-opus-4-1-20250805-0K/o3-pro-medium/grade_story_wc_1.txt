<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Yara's "steadily adaptive" trait manifests through concrete actions—using frost to reveal hidden text, navigating escape routes with measured patience. Her internal conflict between fury and resolve ("letting fury anneal rather than shatter") shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to deliver evidence despite mortal danger carries visible cost, though some emotional transitions feel slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural drive with closure landing as Earned Stasis—Yara chooses forward movement despite danger, with the pendant as "silent beacon of truth" crystallizing her commitment. The frost-revelation sequence provides the central deepening that reweights her purpose. Cost is visible in the pursued escape and the line "glass, once cooled, never doubts the shape it has chosen."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The canyon functions as both shelter and acoustic trap, constraining Yara's escape choices through "labyrinthine acoustics." Frost becomes the critical environmental tool enabling the plot's central discovery. Sensory details like "frost unfurled across the ledger like lace woven by invisible spiders" serve plot while creating atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal survival to exposing a weapons trafficking network, with the frost revelation deepening Yara's commitment despite danger. The pursuing hunters create immediate pressure that forces tactical choices about escape routes. The irony of her art being weaponized adds moral weight, though the final escape feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the glass-making metaphor system—cooling/heating, fragility/strength, transparency/opacity—without explicit moralizing. The concept of "purpose in the pauses" gains resonance through Yara's patient methodology. The final image of glass that "never doubts the shape it has chosen" reweights the entire journey as creative determination.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphorical register appropriate to a glass artist's perception ("molten glass," "anneal," "kiln"). Some passages show excellent rhythm modulation under pressure. However, occasional overwriting ("Stars shimmered above the quiet canyon under stars") and slightly elevated diction in stress moments prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "frost unfurled across the ledger like lace woven by invisible spiders." Information density is good, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for the redundant opening line, occasional overwriting in high-pressure beats, and some filter-verb clustering ("she felt," "she noticed").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The frost-revelation method is genuinely inventive—using cold to reveal what heat destroyed inverts expectations elegantly. The glass artist protagonist examining charcoal smuggling creates fresh thematic resonance. The specific detail of "R.V.S." initials and the irony of artwork becoming weapons elevates beyond generic trafficking plots.</comment>
