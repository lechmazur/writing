I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as the recurring numbers pattern and "echo of forgotten songs" structure suggest density increase and pattern breaks that reweight meaning.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation crystallizes through concrete action—her "brightly attentive gaze" manifests in following number patterns and lying to daemons. The astronauts' chorus thanking her while "singing pieces of a lullaby" provides embodied emotion. However, "forbidden curiosity pulsed behind every blinking cursor" edges toward label-speak rather than dramatized contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: deleted files literally "go home" as missing astronauts sing themselves back into being, with clear cost (Lyra faces punishment, servers crash, legal consequences). The accumulative pattern of recurring numbers coheres into coordinates that unlock consciousness. Minor deduction for slight orientation lag—the archive's nature clarifies gradually rather than anchoring early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The archive's "dark stacks" and "Echo of Forgotten Songs" sector create atmospheric pressure, with shelves "flickering between presence and erasure." Setting constrains choice when "Protocol forbade lone entry." However, the social network archive's physical/digital nature remains somewhat abstract until the metadata revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: numbers appearing everywhere → coordinates → hidden voice memos → restoration attempt → system buckling → public broadcast. Cost is legible when "agents broke through the archive doors" and Lyra accepts punishment. The dominant stake (finding where deleted files go) tightens as she discovers astronauts became metadata.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the concrete discovery that "deleted files go: home." The astronauts trapped as metadata embody corporate memory suppression without abstract moralizing. "Whatever punishment awaited her, she knew where deleted files go" resonates without stating a thesis. The final image of the missing "singing themselves back into being" reweights all prior absence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent tech-noir register with selective perception ("sensed absence," "ghostly breadcrumbs"). Effective compression in "Lyra's brightly attentive eyes hardened." Some filter-verb accumulation ("she realized," "she understood," "she knew") slightly dulls immediacy in revelation beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally propulsive with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density high in lines like "Instead of dying in orbit, they had become metadata, scattered amid memes and advertisements." Some paraphrase loops: "the archive itself had swallowed the crew"/"Living voices were missing, yet the system still wore their weight" restate without advancing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital archive horror with space mission tragedy—astronauts becoming metadata is non-obvious. The concept that corporate memory systems literally trap consciousness transforms familiar data-privacy concerns. "Singing themselves back into being" offers genuine emotional specificity beyond genre templates.</comment>
