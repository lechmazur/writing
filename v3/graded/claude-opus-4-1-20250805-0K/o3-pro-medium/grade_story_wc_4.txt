<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to heal collective pain through pattern-finding is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment in her methodical arrangement of photographs by "the gentle curve of every grin." The townspeople's organic responses—tracing scars, remembering lullabies—show genuine emotional complexity without therapy-speak. However, Lyra herself lacks internal contradiction or struggle; her "perceptively calm" exterior never cracks, limiting depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from solitary arrival through collective gathering to shared commitment. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the community transforms from isolated grief to collaborative healing through the mural plan, with cost visible in "exhaled the kind of yes that sits in the lungs like warm tea." The piece teaches its lyric pattern early through lavender imagery and photograph arrangement, paying off in the final promise of guidance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lavender field and rusted factory create atmospheric pressure that shapes choices—the medicinal scent draws people, the corroded beams provide structure for the photo display. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "purple fog that made streetlights blink like startled moths," "rust seemed to pulse in time, shedding flakes like confetti blessings." The environment constrains and enables the healing ritual, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake of collective healing deepens through accumulation—from Lyra's solitary setup to townspeople discovering connections to shared song—but lacks a decisive tightening moment. Agency manifests through attention and arrangement rather than decision, with cost emerging in the recognition of shared grief. The escalation is gentle and textural rather than pressurized, appropriate for the lens but missing the sharp edge of higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the photograph arrangement revealing hidden connections—"the arc of a stranger's slingshot... matched the scar on his father's temple." The final mural design extending painted vines offers a non-literal answer about continuity between past and present. However, the resolution tends toward the overly harmonious without acknowledging complexity or counter-forces to the healing process.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature shows in selective noticing: "boots skipping over cracked concrete as if notes on a secret staff," "traced the fading factory walls the way a pianist brushes keys." The lyric voice maintains consistency through musical metaphors and synesthetic descriptions. Minor slip in elevated register during peak moments ("vibrated against concrete, against steel, against bone") that slightly exceeds the established voice range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression, with lines doing multiple jobs: "The colors did not alter the truth of the images, but they coaxed dormant stories to the surface like fireflies rising from grass." Some figurative density in peak beats borders on overwriting ("rust seemed to pulse in time, shedding flakes like confetti blessings"). Template cadence appears in the photo-viewing sequence with repeated "One [character] [action]" structures across three sentences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of healing through photographic archaeology and communal art-making offers a fresh angle on collective grief. Specific details like arranging photos "by the gentle curve of every grin" and the factory lullaby create particularity. The piece commits to its lyric mode without retreat, though it plays somewhat safe in its uniformly positive resolution.</comment>
