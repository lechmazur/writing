I'll evaluate this literary story according to the demanding rubric provided.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ezra's contradictory identity as "crisis actor real crisis survivor" drives meaningful choices throughout, with his final decision to share stewardship showing earned growth. The "benevolently ruthless" Calypso provides effective pressure through her calculating assessment and threat/invitation dynamic. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around memory and gesture that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through walking-as-script and chess moves as negotiation. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Ezra transforms from solitary keeper to shared steward, with visible cost in relinquishing sole control. The "interregnum" timeframe creates genuine urgency. Slight deduction for abstract conceptual language that occasionally obscures immediate causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The whispering gallery functions beyond mere setting—its acoustic properties enable the central action of walking-words and stored memories. Strong sensory work with "luminous absence," "marble," "candle soot." The chessboard's physical placement and movement creates spatial choreography. Deduction for some abstract descriptions that could be more tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through walking-pattern communication, chess moves, positioning of followers as "living chess problem," to the final "CHECKMATE" reversal. Stakes crystallize around control of historical memory with genuine cost when Ezra risks sharing power. The interregnum deadline provides consistent pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of who controls history emerges organically through concrete actions—the burned archives, the gallery's memory, Calypso's cataloguing of hesitations. The final line "History...is only ever the echo of someone choosing to notice" resonates without moralizing, reweighting all prior gestures. Strong integration of pawns-as-memories metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled elevated diction fitting the premise ("orphaned glow," "nomadic penumbra"). Some register drift into overly abstract territory ("apprentice to memory," "luminous absences between syllables"). The walking-as-writing conceit is original and consistent. Dialogue minimal but functional when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Multiple instances of abstract phrasing that risk opacity ("nomadic penumbra searching for settled light," "gravestones of propaganda"). Some filter constructions and synonym loops around memory/gesture concepts. Information density high but occasionally sacrifices clarity for poetry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess, acoustic architecture, and historical memory. The walking-as-script innovation and "pawnless chessboard" create non-obvious angles on power and recording. Risk-taking with experimental language mostly succeeds. The contradiction of "crisis actor real crisis survivor" offers original character complexity.</comment>
