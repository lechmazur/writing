<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysander's motivation to heal the eclipsed covenant through self-scarring is viscerally embodied and internally consistent. The contradiction between "anxious elation" and physical pain drives genuine choices. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("purposefully curious") that doesn't fully embody in action, though the scar-mapping sequence lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the maze transforms from trap to spiral guide, with Lysander's scarred body as the living template. The covenant moves from "eclipsed" to visible arc of light. Cost is legible in blood, pain, and permanent scarring. Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the transformative ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt glade's blue-tinged twilight and the maze clipping's crimson sap create vivid sensory anchoring. Setting constrains choice through the roots that bind/release Lysander's ankles. Slight deduction for some abstract descriptors ("dateless twilight") over concrete detail, though the spiral path's physical emergence grounds the transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal communion to covenant restoration to maze-wide transformation. The protagonist's agency drives each escalation through deliberate self-wounding. Cost accumulates visibly: opened scars, blood mingling with sap, permanent white lines mapping the spiral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of symbiotic transformation emerges through concrete action—human scars teaching plant growth patterns. The spiral replacing the maze offers a non-literal answer about freedom through willing sacrifice. Minor deduction for slight abstractness in "intersection of dreams," though the physical mapping of body to landscape resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("petrichor and tungsten-tinged light"). POV maintains consistent mystical-botanical focus. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("coercive hedges," "sympathetic wound") but mostly serves the otherworldly tone. Clean free indirect style throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variation and purposeful compression. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("dateless twilight," "intersection of dreams") and slight overwriting in metaphorical density ("roots like distant thunder"). No loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of body-horror and botanical magic through the scar-mapping concept. The maze-to-spiral transformation offers genuine surprise while feeling earned. "Root-bound visionary" and sympathetic wound growth show original world-building, though some fantasy elements feel familiar.</comment>
