I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation rather than strict causal linkage, with density increases marking progression toward the closure.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ilya's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like swinging the bronze heart and tracing meteor paths. His surrender of the "final speck of remembered stardust" represents genuine internal conflict with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("shadowed rapture," "sidereal fatigue") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands with clear cost - Ilya empties himself to free creativity, becoming "a bell rung clear of clapper yet still resonant." The accumulative lens holds as patterns build toward this crystallized moment. Slight deduction for the extended timespan ("Seasons blurred") that briefly dilutes immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway and bronze heart instrument constrain choices throughout, with the archway's hidden glyphs directly enabling the climactic entry. Sensory details like "flurries needled his cheeks raw" and "frost-laced lichen" are selective and purposeful. The chamber's description as "a cavernous lung" with "walls pulsing with trapped colors" effectively charges the final sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Ilya's progressive sacrifice, from physical exhaustion to surrendering his imaginative core. The "seventh ghost month" marks meaningful deepening, and the cost is legible when he becomes "both lighter and emptied." However, the middle sections could tighten - the seasonal passage feels somewhat static before the comet's arrival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between individual sacrifice and collective renewal. The quill as "the first idea ever silenced" resonates without explicit moralizing. Ilya's refusal to take the quill ("Others would write now") offers a non-literal answer to the central question about creativity's liberation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm, though occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("sidereal fatigue," "shadowed rapture"). The perceptual signature is distinct - Ilya experiences the world through astronomical and musical metaphors. No dialogue to evaluate, which fits the isolated journey.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, some figurative density in non-peak moments ("moth wings desperate for moonlight," "curtains of green and violet fire") and occasional abstract phrasing ("intervals of stillness were not pauses but punctuation marks") create minor drag. Information density is generally high with most lines doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of charting "murmurs rather than mere constellations" and the unwritten calendar tracked through "feelings of sidereal fatigue" offer fresh angles. The astronomical instrument as "bronze heart" and creativity trapped "like a swan pinned under ice" show specific vision. Some familiar fantasy elements (ancient archway, crystalline shard) prevent higher scoring.</comment>
