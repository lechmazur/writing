<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to understand "the shape of home" drives consistent choices through discovery of buried talents, with contradictory impulses between pain/memory and seeking/understanding acting simultaneously. The final realization that home is "not a place I reentered but a direction I could carry" shows earned transformation with visible cost (the pain of memory transformed into planting verses). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("heavier than regret") that doesn't fully embody the emotional state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks and density increases leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where home becomes portable direction rather than fixed place, with felt cost in accepting perpetual journey. The bookstore's nightly reorganization creates persistent constraint that shapes tactics (rushing to plant talents before shuffle). Orientation anchored early (mountain-bookstore, valley, wanderer seeking). Minor deduction for slight causality softness in how planting talents stabilizes the architecture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore setting actively constrains choices through its nightly reorganization and labyrinthine structure, with vivid sensory detail ("phosphorescent margins lit my feet," "vault of biographies that breathed like sleeping whales"). The lost language stone functions as micro-setting that enables the final transformation. Environment guides navigation through the map-feather's texture rather than sight, showing POV-filtered perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking distraction to risking being "sealed inside a chapter forever," with the bookstore's reorganization creating time pressure that forces rapid action. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through actively planting talents and speaking the lost word. Cost is visible in accepting home as perpetual journey rather than return. One meaningful deepening occurs when discovering buried talents shifts from pain to possibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete journey: home transforms from fixed destination to portable direction, with the bookstore-as-heart metaphor organically developing through action. The final image of footsteps writing "the first line of returning" resonates without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the mercury-glass seer's reflections showing "stormclouds hiding within silence." Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "memories started to sting."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic descriptions ("softness pulsed like distant thunder") and selective attention to texture over sight. Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm that accelerates during the reorganization threat. Some filter phrases ("I felt," "I realized") slightly dull immediacy. The seer's dialogue carries subtext about pain and transformation without direct statement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, though some abstract phrases ("heavier than regret," "crushing") lack specificity. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers. Minor loops in thematic territory ("seeding/seed/seeded" appears 5 times). The opening and closing lines effectively bracket the transformation with concrete images.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of bookstore-as-living-organism with the concept of home as portable direction, avoiding typical journey-home clichés. The lost language stone containing a word meaning "hearth, horizon, and returning footstep simultaneously" offers specific innovation. Risk-taking in the lyric mode and non-linear causality heightens meaning while maintaining clarity. The transformation of painful memory into creative planting shows emotional specificity.</comment>
