I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric systematically.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This story operates under a **Causal** lens - Mara's investigation follows clear because/therefore linkages as she uncovers truth through reassembling letters, leading to her decision to protect rather than expose the stillpoint.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's transformation from debunker to guardian is earned through concrete discovery, with contradictory impulses between exposing truth and protecting sanctuary playing out in scene. The final choice to burn evidence and maintain the lie shows clear cost - abandoning her professional identity. Minor deduction for some diagnostic self-awareness ("knew secrecy was not cowardice but mercy") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from investigation to discovery to protection, with clear Decisive Change when Mara becomes the orchard's guardian. Cost is visible in burning her evidence and accepting the lonelier path. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in opening lines. Slight deduction for the convenience of finding exactly the right letter fragments.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The radioactive wasteland and protected orchard create effective pressure, with the flawed diamond constraining the sanctuary to a two-meter circle. Sensory detail is selective ("coppery dust that never settled on leaves") and the stillpoint physically shapes Mara's final choice. Some missed opportunities to make the spatial constraints more tactile during her search.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from investigating a hoax to protecting humanity's potential sanctuary. The dominant stake - truth versus protection - tightens when Mara discovers the stillpoint's vulnerability to exploitation. Cost is clear in her choosing secrecy over her identity as a truth-seeker. The conflict could use one more beat of active pressure before resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the paradox that "sometimes a lie is the flimsy shelter protecting a stillpoint." The story avoids moralizing, letting Mara's choice embody the complex ethics of truth versus mercy. The final image of "a seed of future truth waited, patient as stone" resonantly reweights the entire investigation without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with scientific precision ("carbon lattice was fractured") appropriate to Mara's expertise. Some effective perceptual signature in how she "cataloged every detail." Dialogue is minimal but functional. Deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't quite fit ("hallucination inside the ochre swirl") and some filter-verb clustering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several issues: template cadence in middle section ("Mara looked... Mara considered... Mara remembered"), some overwriting ("shimmered like a hallucination"), and repetitive sentence openings. The scaffold phrase "Mara had not walked two hundred kilometers to repeat gossip" feels forced. Information density is moderate but could be tighter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh angle on post-apocalyptic sanctuary through the flawed diamond creating a physics anomaly rather than mystical protection. The transformation from cursed object to scientific phenomenon, and the choice to preserve the lie for protection, offers genuine originality. The specific detail of corporate liquidation documents adds authenticity. Slight deduction for familiar wasteland tropes.</comment>
