<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to discover "what walls dream about" drives consistent choices through concrete actions like following vibrations and preserving the acoustic maps. Her decision to guard the corridors rather than sell findings shows values hierarchy with visible cost ("weight of legacy's burden"). The character-specific perception through acoustic sensitivity ("ears were more compass than ornament") creates distinctive interiority, though some emotional beats rely on abstractions like "Legacy's burden pulsed."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Liora's vow to guard the corridors crystallizes her stance with felt cost ("inheritance humming around her"). The pattern of acoustic discovery builds through concrete beats: finding diaries → discovering negative → locating capsule → activating recorder, each deepening the stakes. Cost is visible in her choice to forgo comfort "beside the new polar lakes" for guardianship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage functions as active setting that constrains choices—the "half-collapsed" archway limits entry, "weakened tiles" require mapped routes, and acoustic cavities enable discovery. Sensory detail layers effectively ("silence so dense it pressed back like velvet"). The post-climate world anchors immediately and shapes everything from the "bruised orange sky" to the architectural preservation mission.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Liora's discoveries that deepen understanding: diaries reveal architect's intent → negative shows protest context → capsule contains living memory. The dominant stake (preserving acoustic heritage) tightens when she must choose between selling findings for comfort or accepting guardianship's burden. Cost is legible in the trade-off, though the middle section could apply more immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the children's anthem stored in walls becomes a resonant answer about resilience versus ruin. The recurring image of dreams in stone pays off when "walls are awake," reweighting the opening premise. Subtext operates through the architect's hidden capsule "like implanting a heart" and Liora's final smile suggesting acceptance of inheritance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through specialized vocabulary ("corridor echo cartographer," "parabolic microphone") and consistent POV filter of acoustic perception. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("Legacy's burden pulsed in that projection") that doesn't fully match Liora's established practical voice. Perceptual signature stays strong with sound-focused noticing throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("charting the acoustics of abandoned hallways the way old sailors once mapped currents"). Some overwriting appears in metaphor clusters ("lips trembling," "dead petals," "breathing secrets" in adjacent lines). Template cadence emerges in the "She [verb]" pattern across multiple paragraphs, though momentum generally sustains through varied paragraph lengths.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The concept of acoustic archaeology in climate-devastated ruins offers fresh specificity beyond typical post-apocalyptic exploration. The synthesis of environmental collapse with preserved protest songs creates non-obvious thematic resonance. Risk-taking in the specialized profession and technical details (parabolic microphone, acoustic cavities) heightens authenticity without becoming gimmicky.</comment>
