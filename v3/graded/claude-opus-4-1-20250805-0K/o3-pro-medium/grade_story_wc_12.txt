<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The priest's methodical layering of chants while confronting the demon shows clear motivation rooted in ritual expertise, with internal consistency as he shifts from rhetorical questioning to offering absolution. The demon's arc from sarcasm to self-awareness through forced replay creates genuine character movement with visible cost. Minor deduction for the girl remaining relatively passive after possession ends, though her final question adds texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when the demon achieves self-awareness through the loop pedal's forced replay and releases the girl, with visible cost in its "winter wind" departure. The accumulative/textural lens holds as layered chants build cathedral-like architecture that traps and transforms. The priest's final acceptance of perpetual pilgrimage ("mapping each fragile soul") crystallizes the cost of this victory's temporary nature.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor's cracked marble and the sonic cathedral built from looped chants create a vivid metaphysical space that constrains the demon's escape options. The midnight pigment orbiting "like a moon that had forgotten all other hues" provides strong visual specificity. Setting actively shapes conflict through the anchor preventing reality-skipping and the loops creating inescapable architecture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from initial possession threat through rhetorical combat to the demon's attempted physical attack, each move narrowing options under the accumulative lens. The loop pedal's replay mechanism forcing self-awareness creates meaningful deepening that changes the demon's knowledge. Cost is visible in both the demon's disgusted departure and the priest's perpetual burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between unity (single color) and variety, with assumptions requiring illumination as the core philosophical question. The final image of the priest as "janitor of meaning, sweeping resonance into corners where despair forgets to look" offers a non-literal answer about persistent hope. The girl's question about standing in rain yet never getting wet crystallizes the paradox of internal transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice emerges through inventive metaphors ("moon that had forgotten all other hues," "cathedral of hush") and controlled rhythm that modulates with scene pressure. The priest's rhetorical sophistication ("Anaphora rolled over polysyndeton") matches his centuries of experience. Minor register elevation in philosophical passages remains consistent with the metaphysical subject matter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the layered description of rhetorical devices becoming architecture. Some figurative density in peak beats ("spidered across the creature's borrowed confidence") but serves the accumulative pattern. Clear propulsion through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The loop pedal priest concept transforms exorcism tropes through musical/technological fusion, creating fresh stakes where repetition becomes weapon. The demon forced to watch its own "bloopers" until achieving self-awareness offers genuine novelty. Risk-taking in the experimental voice and metaphysical architecture pays off with coherent closure (+0.4 within band for bold structural choices).</comment>
