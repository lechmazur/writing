<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to complete her mother's work while reading glass fragments creates clear internal drive. The communion scene shows contradictory impulses between trust and uncertainty. Final choice to reweave rather than replace earns its cost through prior setup of the town's need for illumination.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases from harbor to atrium to transformed perception. Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the atrium's transformation making beauty "adjust the axis of perception" with visible cost in Mira's labor and the town's shifted awareness. The pond's closing rings provide satisfying closure confirmation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pearl Bay's dawn breath, the prism atrium's coral glow, and the pond's ripple-reading create vivid sensory anchors. The atrium constrains Mira's choices through its specific fractures requiring reweaving rather than replacement. Final noctilucent sky charges the ending with environmental pressure that validates the transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (finishing mother's work) through technical (mending by nightfall) to communal (town forgetting how to look). The pond's third ring warning creates time pressure that tightens options. Cost manifests in Mira's precise labor and the deckhands' transformed perception.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through glass-as-perception metaphor without stating morals. The atrium's wounds becoming apertures ("turning error into aperture") resonates beyond plot. Final image of pond's satisfied rings reweights the opening's silver breath into completed communion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through phrases like "noctilucent reckonings" and "lily pond where old salt sages commune." POV maintains consistent lyric distance with controlled rhythm. Perceptual signature evident in how Mira reads stories in glass fragments others see as reflections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose density high with lines like "dawn stretched over sleeping boats" doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction ("tectonic murmurs," "noctilucent filaments") occasionally strains but serves the lyric mode. Information flows cleanly without loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glass-reading as divination practice offers fresh angle on repair narrative. The pond communion method for reading patterns feels specific and earned. Transformation of mundane harbor life through prismatic light avoids cliché redemption.</comment>
