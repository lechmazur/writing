<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Milo's motivation to find light for his dying sister is clear and drives every choice, with "wistfully pragmatic" embodied through his methodical gardening and repair work. The sister Nara gains agency through healing the prism, though her transformation from bedridden to active feels slightly rushed. Internal conflict between risking the journey versus staying with Nara creates genuine tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: rose dies → Milo seeks new light source → lockmaster's tooth enables access → prism discovery → sister heals it. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as the siblings become permanent guardians of light, with visible cost (leaving their old life). The orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the drive lens maintains consistency throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The harbor setting actively constrains choices through fire escapes, tides, and the abandoned floodgate tower's physical challenges. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("algae-slick ladder," "moonlight varnished the current"). The underground chamber of captured moonbeams provides a unique, specific environment that enables the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (sister's hope) to communal (city's light) through Milo's discovery. The prism's widening fissure creates time pressure and forces the choice to bring Nara. Cost is visible when they commit to permanent guardianship, though the transformation of stakes from individual to collective feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of tending light/hope emerges organically through gardening metaphor extended to civic caretaking. The final image of the glowing rosebush reweights the opening's dead petals without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the parallel between nurturing plants and nurturing communal infrastructure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "wistfully pragmatic custodian" and "protected vulnerability," though occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("luminescence instill itself"). The recurring "rhythm of oars in water" creates intentional pattern. Some filter verb clusters ("Milo felt," "he realized," "he understood") dull immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of beauty ("moonlight varnished the current") but suffers from repetitive structures and the phrase "rhythm of oars in water" appearing four times without sufficient variation. Several filter verb stacks reduce immediacy. The template cadence "He [verb], then [verb]" pattern appears in multiple sequences, though the lyrical moments partially compensate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of underground light chambers feeding a city through hidden grates offers fresh urban fantasy. The synthesis of gardening and civic infrastructure maintenance creates an original metaphor. The specific detail of the bitting gauge tooth as key adds authenticity, though the magical realism elements follow somewhat familiar patterns.</comment>
