<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to understand story magnetism is grounded in her physical transformation (donor heart), creating embodied stakes that drive choices throughout. The internal sensation of the "borrowed organ" as "quietly explosive" manifests in concrete perception shifts, though some emotional transitions feel slightly compressed. Her final understanding arrives through dramatized discovery rather than epiphany, with visible cost in accepting the listening role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks and density increases building toward Liora's Resonant Reconfiguration as "Heart of Drift." The closure lands with conceptual cost—she transforms from seeking to offering listening—though the middle section's causality occasionally softens into atmospheric description. The orientation anchors (floating tea house, dawn, post-transplant) establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating tea house setting actively constrains choices through vertical navigation (rope stairs to upper terrace) and atmospheric effects (mist thickness, sun trails). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"mist tasting of cedar and secrets"—with the environment directly enabling the pigment-making process. The setting's ethereal quality supports the story's exploration of intangible magnetism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding story magnetism) tightens through progressive revelations: the boy's tale tugging at her sternum, the elder's warning about gravity crushing, and the final pigment creation. However, the middle section lacks a decisive pressure point where Liora must choose between competing options. The cost becomes visible only in the final transformation to offering rather than seeking.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of listening versus magnetizing emerges through concrete images—the morpho wing's "iridescent caution," memories dancing "like playful swallows" across cloth. The final realization that "some people magnetize stories because their silence aches for listeners" reweights all prior seeking. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit articulation of theme in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a distinctive lyric register with controlled imagery ("steam wreathed around their ankles," "pupils widened the way silk widens"). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, with the elder's cryptic pronouncements advancing plot through subtext. The perceptual signature consistently filters through an artisan's awareness of light, color, and texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, though some figurative density approaches overwriting ("Legend said every visitor left carrying a tale that clung like steel dust"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for occasional template patterns ("She began to," "She had come," "She realized") and metaphor clustering in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of a dye master with a donor heart seeking story magnetism at a floating tea house offers genuine freshness through specific synthesis. The transformation of the morpho wing into memory-releasing pigment feels earned through established artisan logic. The concept avoids derivative templates, though the mystical mentor figure edges toward familiar territory.</comment>
