I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as the piece builds through layered imagery and density shifts rather than strict causal linkage, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Callix's relationship to immortality transforms.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Callix's boredom-to-thirst transformation earns its arc through embodied struggle with the shard's rebellion and the visceral glimpses of lost loves "dying again, waving as if the first farewell never counted." The contradictory impulse to step forward into spatial mutiny while knowing it would "fold me like paper" demonstrates genuine internal conflict acted in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Callix shifts from passive ennui to "genuine thirst" for goodbye, with clear cost implied through the dangerous hunt ahead and the shard stored "inside my ribcage, the only prison I trusted." The accumulative build through magnetic struggle, vision fragments, and spatial rebellion coheres into this earned stance change, though the cost could be more viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite's "many angled walls" that "bent light into kneeling shapes" actively participates in the spatial mutiny, while the storm's electromagnetic flux enables the containment ritual. Setting constrains choice when "the unintended asymmetry warped the magnetic lullaby into a shriek," forcing tactical adaptation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating intensity: shard's arrival → magnetic containment attempt → spatial mutiny eruption → vision of farewells → near-catastrophic temptation → successful re-tuning. The stakes crystallize around whether Callix can master the fragment without being consumed, with palpable cost in the "seams that bled candlelight" showing loved ones dying again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of what lies "beyond goodbye" emerges through concrete imagery of "a door made of unspoken farewells" and the revelation that "goodbye is not an ending, only a coordinate." The final reframing of boredom as "merely a refusal to intrigue oneself with the next coordinate" offers resonant insight without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinctive texture through inventive constructions like "silence spread...like dyed glass surrendering to dusk" and "electromagnetism is the lullaby of rebellious matter." The perceptual signature of dimensional awareness manifests in lines like "I felt the room curl" and "surfaces swapping distances like dancers exchanging partners."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose density serves the accumulative mode with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional abstraction dulls immediacy ("everything felt rephrased, like a poem whispered through thunderclaps then recopied by candlelight"). Some metaphor strain appears but doesn't obscure closure; rhythm control strengthens in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of immortal ennui with electromagnetic containment of reality-bending artifacts feels fresh, particularly the concept of "spatial mutiny, when objects refuse assigned coordinates." The specific detail of storing the shard "inside my ribcage" and the image of farewells as navigable coordinates elevate beyond template immortality tales.</comment>
