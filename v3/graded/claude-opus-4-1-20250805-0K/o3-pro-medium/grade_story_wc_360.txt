I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is an Accumulative/Textural piece where density increases and pattern breaks create meaning through the printing of impossible mathematics and the restoration of vanished stars.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dreya's gift of "transposed empathy" drives genuine internal conflict as she absorbs the astronomer's loneliness while maintaining her own agency. The decision to print ambiguity rather than clarity ("only in the gash between knowing and guessing") emerges from consistent character logic. Minor deduction for the astronomer remaining off-page, limiting relationship dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where printing the equation literally restores the vanished stars, with clear cost in Dreya keeping "one feather from each" borrowed personality. The accumulative structure builds through impossible printing materials (mirrors, moth wings) to the final transformation. Slight weakness in the astronomer's motivations remaining opaque.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The letterpress workshop anchors the scene physically while stars vanishing creates temporal pressure. Strong integration of printing materials as setting elements that constrain choices. The "topaz workshop under stars" and specific press mechanics ground the fantastical elements effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal commission to cosmic restoration as stars vanish completely. The pressure coheres around Dreya's choice to embrace ambiguity over precision, with visible cost in the "bruised ribs" and retained personality fragments. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "the universe was waiting to be reassured."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox that "some equations are true precisely because they never resolve." The mathematics of emotion concept develops through concrete printing choices rather than abstraction. The final image of stars "naming themselves without needing her ink" offers resonant closure without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("gears clicking like cicada wings"). POV remains stable through Dreya's consciousness even as she absorbs others' personalities. Slight register elevation in places ("lucid turbulence stirring behind her eyes") but generally consistent with the fantastical premise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the paper exhaled a chord no ear could parse"). Some density issues with stacked metaphors in peak beats. Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "She [verb]" constructions. Information density high but occasionally tips into overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of letterpress printing with cosmic mathematics creates genuine originality. The concept of printing emotions as equations through "deliberate ambiguity" transforms familiar workshop-story tropes. Risk-taking in the surreal printing materials and star restoration pays off thematically.</comment>
