I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered revelations, symbolic objects, and a pattern of industrial hauntings that culminate in a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong contradictory impulses act throughout—the narrator's "religiously skeptical" creed battles against growing belief, embodied in "Belief felt like gravel in my mouth, unwelcome but solid." The final choice to keep the wheel "unsold, unshared, a private metric" earns its weight through prior causality. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("drowsy alertness buzzed through my temples") that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the beaded wheel's transformation from industrial artifact to "private metric" that measures guilt and confession. The cost is visceral: Caleb literally swallowed evidence, tasting "carbon copy blue whenever he lied." The accumulative lens holds as radio patterns, ghost shifts, and the wheel's impossible spinning cohere into "truth finally heavier in memory than in gut."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned tunnel setting constrains choices effectively—the "chill seep[ing] through my jeans," the specific placement on "a crosstie," and the "metal tang left by locomotives long scrapped" all pressure the ritual. The beaded valve wheel functions as micro-setting that enables the central measurement. Slight deduction for some generic markers ("rusted girders and comet tails of graffiti").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation: from chasing voices to Caleb's confession about swallowing the logbook to the wheel's supernatural response spelling "SHIFT SETTLED." The dominant stake—measuring the weight of guilt—tightens as the wheel becomes a "ghost scale" that quantifies remorse. Cost is legible in Caleb's physical relief and the narrator's shift from skepticism to belief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of weighing intangible truths via industrial machinery. The final image—"lighter by the exact weight of what we now knew"—offers a non-literal answer about how confession and witness transform burden. The recurring motif of spectral labor clocking in/out deepens from literal ghost story to metaphor for persistent guilt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "I am a reckless abandoned-mill explorer by habit, religiously skeptical by creed." The voice maintains controlled distance while revealing vulnerability through specific habits like "interpreting frantic calls to talk-radio psychics." Dialogue carries subtext effectively—Caleb's murmured fear that "words might bruise the quiet" reveals his emotional state without declaration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with high information density—lines like "The brass beads threaded around its rim glimmered in flashlight glare, a rosary for machinery" do multiple jobs. Some figurative excess appears ("coal dust refusing to settle," "incense-sweet nonsense") but doesn't obscure clarity. Minor template cadence in the radio caller section ("one caller had hissed...another sobbed") costs precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of industrial archaeology with supernatural debt creates an original angle on ghost stories. The specific detail of swallowing a logbook that makes lies taste "carbon copy blue" transforms familiar guilt narratives. The concept of a "ghost scale" that measures remorse through spectral labor patterns feels inevitable in hindsight while avoiding genre clichés.</comment>
