I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through lyric imagery and memory fragments toward a resonant reconfiguration where coincidences gain meaning through the beacon's rekindling.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lioh's motivation crystallizes through retrocognitive memories and his belief that "coincidences were messages scribbled by lost gods," driving concrete actions with the prism shards. The internal conflict between the elders' warnings about the hush and his determination creates genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("treasured the fragment the way seeds treasure storms") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the rekindled beacon creates "that barely measurable tilt of destiny" with clear cost (the prism cracking further, splitting into hovering slivers). The accumulative structure builds through 73 evenings of star-tracking to the vision sequence and final illumination. The orientation anchors (Lioh, ruined coast, beacon tower) establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass pavilion's humming and the prism shards constrain Lioh's choices throughout—the "soundlessness so thick it bruised the ears" creates specific tactile pressure. The post-collapse setting with "unfamiliar constellations" and salvaged technology shapes every action. Slightly generic in places ("salt winds," "fallen towers") but the shard of hush and its properties elevate specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: 73 nights of failed attempts, then the pattern match, the risky insertion of the hush shard, the vision flood, and finally the beacon's ignition affecting distant rafts. The cost manifests in the prism cracking further and the hush consuming "half the resonance." Stakes remain coherent around proving meaning exists in apparent randomness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme emerges beautifully through the concrete image of coincidences as "errant gestures that later proved deliberate"—shown through the boy's dropped coin saving a ship. The final "barely measurable tilt of destiny" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The recurring motif of fragments/slivers/cracks becoming "windows" deepens organically through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("ribs of fallen towers like flutes carved from bone"). The perceptual signature shows in how Lioh experiences the hush as "bruising the ears" and memories as "gulls returning to unbuilt nests." Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("retrocognitively blessed") but mostly serves the post-collapse register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The age was reckoned as after the collapse of civilization, a phrase mouthed with weary irony by survivors who remembered letters"). Some figurative density in places ("thistle-blown hope," "burial wind") but pattern-consistent. Minor scaffold in the machinery chamber sequence with sequential "One by one" construction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse keeper archetype with retrocognitive memory and the concept of meaningful coincidence. The "shard of hush" as soundlessness that can be physically manipulated is genuinely inventive. The transformation of broken fragments into windows rather than wounds offers a non-obvious resolution that feels earned.</comment>
