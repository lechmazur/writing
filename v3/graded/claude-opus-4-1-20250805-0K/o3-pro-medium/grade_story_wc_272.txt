<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's guilt-driven motivation and internal contradiction between seeking redemption and fearing he fractured his mother work well, with embodied details like "palms to the iron door" and the fragmented perception mirroring his psychological state. The final surrender to darkness rather than capture shows genuine character evolution with visible cost. Minor deductions for some abstract phrasing ("luminescent ache") and occasional diagnostic language ("fragmented reality clung to him").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through water imagery, mirror fragments, and the Moon card's discovery creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts fracture as art. Cost is visible in his surrender and the loss of the Moon card. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (lighthouse, Elias, storm). Slight deduction for the abstract nature of some transitions between discovery moments.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse-library hybrid setting actively constrains choices through flooding water, closing walls, and the trapdoor descent, with vivid sensory work ("brine-spotted volumes," "blue fungus"). The environment forces Elias's final surrender and the sea cave revelation. Strong integration of setting as pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake of redemption/understanding his mother's fate escalates through the library's shifting reality, mirror fragments showing bleeding portraits, and water forcing him downward. The final surrender to darkness shows agency through renunciation with clear cost. Could benefit from more concrete intermediate pressures between discovery beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of accepting fragmentation as valid reality emerges through concrete images (broken tarot box, mirror shards, missing Moon card) rather than statement. The final insight "fractured worlds can be art if one accepts the cracks as contours" resonates without moralizing, reweighting all prior fragmentation imagery. Strong subtext in the mother-son artistic legacy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and poetic compression ("Rain hammered the lantern glass"). Perceptual signature clear in how Elias notices artistic/symbolic details. Some register elevation in places ("luminescent ache," "marble columns of shelved dust") slightly exceeds the POV's natural lexicon but remains mostly consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("lighthouse that rose like a gaunt finger," "walls seemed to breathe inward"). Deductions for occasional overwriting ("marble columns of shelved dust"), some abstract phrasing that reduces clarity ("fragmented reality clung to him like wet linen"), and minor repetition of "untangling threads." Information density good but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse as psychological space, tarot as family portrait, and water as both threat and guide. The specific detail of the Moon card bearing his mother's face transforms the divination trope. Risk-taking in the surreal elements and acceptance of fracture as art shows commitment to vision.</comment>
