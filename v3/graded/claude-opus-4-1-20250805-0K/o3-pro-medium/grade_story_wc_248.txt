<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ash's motivation through the "promise" drives clear, consistent choices from match avoidance to ember return. The vandalized self-portrait moment ("Someone loved those books enough to wound her painted double") shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "volcanic tenderness" recurring without sufficient embodiment in gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as artistic clues build toward the archive revelation and ember return, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration when "The archive had never blamed her; it had only waited." Cost is visible in seven years of exile and the emotional weight of returning what was stolen. The pattern-based structure through murals/cairns/tapestry coheres well, though the final mural appearing "from the ceiling" strains physical logic slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Desert canyons, lava tubes, and obsidian archive create atmospheric pressure, with sensory details like "archives scented with dust" grounding the journey. The archive's bronze lectern and ashstone chamber constrain the final choice. Deduction for some generic desert/volcano imagery that could be more specific to Veyra.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulated artistic clues requiring analytical interpretation, narrowing toward the single necessary act of returning the ember. The "stolen match coated in luminous resin" creates specific pressure tied to arrest fear. Cost lands clearly in the seven-year exile and emotional reckoning, though the resolution feels slightly convenient with the archive's immediate forgiveness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through return emerges organically from the concrete journey, with the archive's forgiveness reweighting Ash's self-conception as destroyer. The vandalized self-portrait with stitched eyes resonates as both judgment and invitation. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit "Return the ember, and the library will forgive" which states rather than implies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical compression with distinctive phrases like "scorching overdue silence into ash" and "heart pounding volcanic tenderness." The analytical reading of patterns creates a clear perceptual signature. Some register elevation in phrases like "analogically intuitive mind" doesn't quite fit the otherwise grounded narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful fragments like "Promise rescued." Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive "volcanic tenderness" (appears twice), some abstract phrasing ("analytically intuitive" feels forced), and the slightly mechanical "Thus began" transition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The arsonist-seeking-forgiveness angle transforms the expected revenge narrative, and the artistic breadcrumb trail offers fresh specificity. The vandalized self-portrait as both wound and invitation shows originality. The premise of returning a stolen ember to achieve library forgiveness feels slightly convenient but executes with enough particularity to avoid full template status.</comment>
