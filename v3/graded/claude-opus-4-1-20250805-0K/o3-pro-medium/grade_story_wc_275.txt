<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amber's choice between violence and cultivation drives genuine internal conflict, with the knife sheathing moment crystallizing her values under pressure. Her scarred palms embody the cost of patient work versus her father's violent legacy. Minor deduction for Cullin's somewhat rapid transformation from "man who had forgotten stillness" to rose-tender.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Situational lens holds as external pressure (council threat) forces stance crystallization through the rose demonstration. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Amber's method prevails with visible cost (scarred palms, risk of requisition). The "engraved quiet" working through visitors and soldiers provides coherent accumulation toward the final negotiation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dome constrains choices effectively—the glass vulnerability shapes Amber's non-violent approach and the punctured scars from debris create immediate stakes. Rose arrangements as "small shields" and the sensory detail of "fragrance into certainty" charge the confrontation scene. Minor deduction for generic "high sun" and "sand whorls."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation works through mounting pressure: dome damage → father's warning → council arrival → negotiation. The shift from "barbed certainty" to accepting soil samples shows meaningful de-escalation earned through Amber's method. Stakes remain somewhat abstract—"requisition the glass" lacks visceral immediacy of what failure means for Amber personally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through the contrast of violence/cultivation, with roses literally embodying values. The final image of planting seeds "outside the dome" resonates as expansion beyond protective boundaries. Slight deduction for on-the-nose phrasing like "continuity could be woven with roots as surely as with blood."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent POV with strong perceptual signature ("memory quaked through territory like restless sandstorms"). Dialogue differentiates characters adequately—Cullin's "hoarse like desert rust" versus the leader's clipped commands. Some register elevation in peak moments ("tranquil blaze of dawn soak through her armor") slightly strains the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves solid density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Cullin entered, boots dusted, eyes scanning corners like a man who had forgotten stillness"). Some figurative excess ("memory quaked," "sandstorms," "shoulders loosening like knots undone by warm rain") but maintains clarity. Minor template cadence in the council arrival sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of "engraved quiet"—teaching values through plant cultivation—offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic rebuilding. The specific detail of etched mineral slivers beside seedlings transforms a potential cliché. The father-daughter dynamic through contrasting methods (bounty hunter/farmer) adds authentic complexity.</comment>
