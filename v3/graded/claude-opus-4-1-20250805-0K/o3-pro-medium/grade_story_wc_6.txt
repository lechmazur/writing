I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This story operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens, building through layered imagery and ritual toward a resonant reconfiguration where Maia accepts her dual inheritance through the lagoon's ritual.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maia's internal contradiction between firefighter duty and arsonist heritage creates genuine tension, embodied through the burn scar's tingling recognition of the lagoon's song. The final choice to "douse what you lit, but not despise the spark" emerges from accumulated pressure rather than sudden epiphany, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("proof that destruction could be convinced to host mercy").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres around the lagoon ritual as Resonant Reconfiguration, with Maia's whispered vow and the coin's descent creating visible transformation ("woodsmoke lifting from her skin, departing like forgiven ghosts"). Cost is felt through tears and the scar's response, though the metaphysical elements ("lagoon sang when sky grazed water") strain credibility without clearer grounding in the story's reality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and black volcanic sand create a distinctive setting that constrains choice (Maia must enter the water for the ritual) and charges the ending. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("kelp-drift peace," "glassy surface reflecting torches"), though some descriptions veer ornamental ("clouds overhead drifted east to west, their procession mirrored below").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconciling firefighter duty with arsonist heritage—deepens through the pilgrim's ritual invitation and Maia's decision to expose her scar. The lagoon scene creates meaningful pressure that forces stance crystallization, though escalation relies more on accumulation than causal tightening, fitting the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the graft metaphor ("All grafted things yearn to speak"), connecting physical healing to emotional reconciliation without explicit moralizing. The final image of "water that remembers fire yet offers cool hands" resonantly answers the central question, though "unyielding compassion" appears somewhat mechanically.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with distinctive perceptual signature ("sirens faded behind the dunes," "lunar time"). Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext (pilgrim's "All grafted things yearn to speak"), though some passages drift toward purple prose ("glimmering bruise colors").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythmic control and information density, with varied sentence structures supporting the meditative pace. However, several instances of overwriting appear ("lunar time," "weathered ivy," "glimmering bruise colors") and the metaphor density in peak beats occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of firefighter/arsonist's daughter creates fresh tension, and the lagoon ritual offers an original resolution mechanism. The graft metaphor transforms familiar healing imagery through specific application, though some elements (pilgrims, cloud migration) feel more ornamental than essential.</comment>
