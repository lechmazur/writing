I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through imagery, repetition, and density toward a resonant reconfiguration where Declin passes through and Mara continues her vocation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as "tender shadow keeper" who "burns bridges carefully" manifests through concrete action—teaching a ghost boy to breathe. Her internal conflict between holding memories and releasing them plays out through embodied gesture (tracing soot, touching scars). The final choice to continue her vocation after Declin's passage shows earned character continuity with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Declin learns to breathe and passes through the doorknocker portal, while Mara accepts her ongoing role. The accumulative structure coheres through repeated breath/suffocation imagery building to transformation. Cost is visible in "loaded emptiness settle, not heavier, only more articulate." Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sanctuary functions as active setting—its "fading threshold" where "life and death touched without agreeing" enables the teaching. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("violet over ashen charcoal," "soot like constellations"). The doorknocker ring transforms from artifact to portal. Environment directly constrains and enables the central action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through breath-teaching sequence: Declin's phantom attempts "fracture," then hold as "small sphere," finally enabling passage. Pressure builds through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens. Cost manifests in Mara's acceptance of perpetual wound-tending: "walked toward the next wound begging for a tutor."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "teach suffocating to breathe"—learning release through patient instruction. The story resists easy resolution; Mara continues her vocation rather than achieving closure. The final image of the sanctuary whose "darkness inhaled easily" offers resonant answer to the opening's "silence inhaled itself."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "Night bled violet," "stories that refused to speak," "leaving braided ribbons of ash." Perceptual signature consistent—Mara notices through metaphors of keeping, tending, dust. Rhythm modulates effectively from contemplative opening to active teaching sequence. No dialogue needed for this ghost-communion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong figurative control mostly lands ("Night bled violet," "memory pressed against her ribs"). Some density excess in places ("loaded emptiness," "lanternless yet visible") approaches oversaturation but maintains coherence. Information density high—most lines do multiple jobs. Minor template moments ("Again, she said without speaking") but propulsion remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story with pedagogy—teaching the dead to breathe inverts expected haunting dynamics. The specific image system (breath, soot, scars, thresholds) feels organic to this world. Risk-taking in the lyrical density and abstract stakes pays off through concrete gesture. "Burns bridges carefully, leaving braided ribbons of ash" exemplifies fresh specificity.</comment>
