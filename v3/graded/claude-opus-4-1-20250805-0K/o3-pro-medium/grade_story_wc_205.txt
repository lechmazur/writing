I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Velen's motivation as a "defunct revolutionary" clinging to idealistic interpretation is clear and consistent, with his internal conflict between rust-tasting defeat and persistent hope embodied through concrete actions. The final choice to "devise new verses, and from the verses new engines" shows earned transformation with visible cost ("burnished sorrow would always border its frame"). Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing in emotional moments ("poetically inclined heart") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through bronze smoke time, velvet-draped mirrors, and crystallized script to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Velen accepts the "lustered ache" while constructing futures. The closure lands with conceptual cost—acknowledging permanent sorrow while choosing to build. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the chronostorm experiment provides the decisive deepening that unlocks meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid with visible time "swirling like bronze smoke" creates a unique, constraining environment where inhabitants "walked carefully, afraid to bruise the delicate eddies." The Mirror Grotto and chronostorm actively shape Velen's experimental method, with covered mirrors preventing "loose seconds from multiplying reflections into madness." Setting directly enables the story's central discovery through environmental mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute establishes clear stakes early, with Velen's interpretation mattering "less for prestige than for possibility." The chronostorm provides meaningful escalation as time becomes weaponized for discovery, and the revealed inscription "We failed to free ourselves, so we freed the future" forces Velen to confront his own defeats. Cost is visible in the "bronze smoke" taste of victory and acceptance of permanent sorrow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the crystal shard's message about freeing futures rather than selves, resonating with Velen's arc from defeated revolutionary to architect of postponed revolutions. The final image of devising "new verses, and from the verses new engines" offers a non-literal answer about transformation through patient construction. The builders' shattered vase becomes a metaphor for breaking forms while preserving resolve.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with baroque flourishes ("lunar circuits," "arcades of the baroque asteroid") that matches the ornate setting, though occasionally veers toward purple prose. POV remains stable in limited third, with Velen's poet-revolutionary perspective coloring descriptions. Some register elevation in peak moments ("stern, bittersweet permission") that slightly exceeds the established baseline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("time swirling like bronze smoke," "hurling hours and minutes like razor sleet") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing too frequently in high-pressure beats. Some abstract phrasing ("postponed revolutions," "emancipatory contours") reduces immediacy. The paraphrase loop between "failed to free ourselves/freed the future" and Velen's similar defeat needed tighter compression.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of visible time in a baroque asteroid offers fresh worldbuilding, and the archaeological dispute over revolutionary versus ornamental interpretations provides non-obvious stakes. The chronostorm mechanism for unlocking ancient messages shows creative problem-solving. However, the revolutionary-interprets-revolution arc follows somewhat predictable lines despite the imaginative setting.</comment>
