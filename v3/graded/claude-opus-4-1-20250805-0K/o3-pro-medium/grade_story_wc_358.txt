I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens**: Causal - the story follows because/therefore linkages as Mara investigates, analyzes data, diagnoses the convergence, and implements a solution.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's investigative competence and methodical approach are well-established through concrete actions. Her motivation to "cultivate foresight in action" drives consistent choices. The final act of scrambling pathways shows agency with clear cost (risking the thunderclap). Minor deduction for slightly abstract interiority ("feeling the words vibrate more than she sounded them").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from investigation to diagnosis to intervention, with the closure showing Decisive Change - Mara successfully prevents future convergences. Cost is visible in the risk she takes and the "silence she had saved." The flight engineer patches as calibration markers provides good causality. Slight opacity around what exactly harvested the momentum prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The shipping container labyrinth constrains movement and channels wind patterns central to the plot. Excellent integration of setting as active element - the containers form "organ pipes" that shape the convergence. Sensory details support the investigation ("steel creaked, complaining"). The environment directly enables both problem and solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from investigation to discovery of the null spot to active intervention. Mara's agency drives the resolution through analyzing patterns and implementing countermeasures. Cost is legible in the risk of the thunderclap and the thousand-hour margin earned. The tightening from passive observation to active prevention works well under causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of imposing human order on catastrophic forces emerges through action. The "foresight in action" versus "hindsight in reports" provides thematic depth. The patches as beacons and Mara's methodical approach to chaos resonate. Final image of "normal wind and the silence she had saved" carries weight but could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong technical voice appropriate to an accident investigator. Perceptual signature clear in how Mara notices wind patterns, pressure differentials, geometric precision. Good psychic distance control, staying close during investigation. Minor register elevation ("exquisitely focused") slightly inconsistent with otherwise clinical tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum. Information density high - most sentences advance investigation or atmosphere. Some elevated diction ("hazy precision," "cultivate foresight") works thematically. Minor issues: "stationless ether" feels overwritten, "singular convergence" repeated unnecessarily. Strong opening and closing lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh angle on disaster investigation through wind pattern analysis. The concept of harvesting a town's momentum is original. Specific details like the anemometer broadcasting randomized algorithms show ingenuity. The precision-folded containers and null spot are memorable images, though the extraction mechanism remains somewhat abstract.</comment>
