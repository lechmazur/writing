<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ada's motivation is clear and layered (restoring art through sound/curiosity), with concrete embodied details like twirling the coin and chalk-streaked fingers. The internal contradiction between her public commission and private motive to "exchange certainty for curiosity" drives genuine tension. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "nested awakenings" that could be more embodied, but the final choice to listen for the next question shows earned character evolution with visible cost (the city's transformed state).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern teaching ("wake the paint, wake the stone, wake the silence, then wake yourself") that pays off through escalating awakening sequences. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the garden transforms the city into living murals of curiosity, with visible cost in citizens' lost certainty. The "nested awakenings" concept structures the progression effectively, though the rapid city-wide transformation in the final beats strains plausibility slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Sound Wave Garden functions as active setting that constrains and enables Ada's choices through its acoustic properties. Sensory details like "echoes painted invisible flowers across the air" and the mural's "throat-shaped alcove" are vivid and purposeful. The garden's agency in answering questions and demanding exchange elevates it beyond backdrop. Slight deduction for some abstract descriptions of the transforming murals that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Ada's dialogue with the garden, from testing echoes to negotiating terms ("Loose the city's certainty") to executing the nested awakening sequence. The dominant stake—reviving dormant acoustics—deepens into exchanging certainty for curiosity citywide. Cost is visible in the final transformation where "certainty became impossible." Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient alignment between Ada's private motive and the garden's demand.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the certainty/curiosity dialectic, avoiding explicit moralizing. The hobo nickel's altered Liberty "who'd already heard tomorrow's secrets" subtly prefigures the transformation. The final image of Ada listening for "the following question" resonates without stating a moral. Slight deduction for the somewhat convenient thematic echo between Ada's philosophy and the garden's demand.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("echoes painted invisible flowers," "the world thinned like ice under midday sun"). POV remains stable with Ada's perceptual signature as artist-chemist-historian. Dialogue between Ada and the garden carries appropriate otherworldly register. Deduction for occasional register elevation that strains the established voice ("primordial," "calcify into certainties").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("gremlins," "editorial laughter"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("the world thinned like ice under midday sun" followed immediately by "Sound seemed to kneel"). Minor template cadence in the awakening sequence ("First she woke... Next she woke... Finally she woke") though it serves the pattern. No major loops or scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of art restoration with sound magic creates an original premise. The concept of awakening a garden through dialogue and having it transform an entire city's relationship with certainty is inventive. The hobo nickel as talisman and the specific awakening sequence feel particular to this world. Transformation of the restoration trope through sound-based magic elevates beyond standard fantasy.</comment>
