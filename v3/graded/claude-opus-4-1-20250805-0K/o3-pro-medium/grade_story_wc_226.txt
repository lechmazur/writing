<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera's defiant artistry and the Marshal's transformation from law enforcer to collaborator show genuine character evolution through concrete choices. The contradictory impulses (duty vs. curiosity for Marshal, memory vs. forgiveness for Vera) act simultaneously in scene, particularly when they co-create the poem. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around forgiveness's "price" that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where both characters transform through collaborative art-making, visible in the Marshal tearing his warrant and Vera feeling "lighter, not absolved but accompanied." The cost is legible—Vera cannot have traditional forgiveness without losing memory, so creates an alternative through gifting the Marshal's virtue. Orientation anchored effectively by paragraph 2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The canyon setting with bone towers and pale spires actively constrains choices—Vera must descend to the monolith, the echoes amplify her poetry, and the spire's whispered price shapes her decision. Sensory details like "chalky edge crumbled," "pearl-colored grit," and carvings that "smelled of salt and lightning" create lived-in specificity. The monolith's mirrors at closure directly result from their colored sand art.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Vera seeking forgiveness to discovering its unacceptable price (memory loss), then pivoting to create alternative redemption through collaborative art. The Marshal's pursuit transforms into participation, showing meaningful deepening. Cost is visible but the middle section could tighten—some poetry descriptions feel ornamental rather than pressurized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the refraction metaphor—single truths split into "many shining shards" via art, enacted when their poem "folded law into lullaby, wrath into warning." The ending's mirrors showing "different truth of them stared back, none complete, all sincere" offers resonant non-literal answer. Minor deduction for slightly abstract handling of "forgiveness" concept in places.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("dawn fingered the rims," "forged hush") and controlled rhythm. Perceptual signature clear in how Vera notices artistic potential everywhere. Some register elevation feels slightly forced ("prismatic confession," "ricocheted off canyon walls") and dialogue is minimal, limiting character voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Information density high in places like "She wore an innocently mischievous smile that confused the vultures." Deductions for occasional overwriting ("ricocheted off the canyon walls, returned enlarged, collided again") and some abstract phrasing around forgiveness that dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of artistic defiance with spiritual pilgrimage—the canyon that usually receives prayers instead witnesses impromptu poetry as alternative redemption. The Marshal character subverts authority archetype by choosing collaboration. The refraction concept transforms familiar forgiveness narrative into something more complex about preserving necessary failures.</comment>
