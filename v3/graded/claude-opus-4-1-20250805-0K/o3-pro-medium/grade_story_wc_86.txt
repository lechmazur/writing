I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds density through recurring images (drawer pull, silver twine, moon phases) and atmospheric pressure rather than causal turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization as "the hinge" between states crystallizes through concrete choices—untethering Ilren, gifting the drawer pull, threading twine through it. Her final smile and internalization of "tide-stained quiet" shows earned transformation through accumulated gestures rather than dramatic revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's final act of threading the silver twine through the drawer pull—transforming binding into connection. The cost is felt in "mistakes begin loosening, threads ready for recycling" and chains "already remembering how to open," though the emotional price could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The parapet setting actively constrains the exchange through its "invisible border" of cracked stones and shapes perception through "furrowed hush." The drawer pull's transformation from dungeon furniture to talisman to pendant meaningfully charges the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes accumulate through ritual phases (moon synchronization, ceremonial binding, exchange protocol) with one meaningful deepening when Mara untethers Ilren before the exchange. The "moment glimmered between apology and forgiveness" crystallizes tension, though additional pressure points would strengthen escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of binding objects—silver twine falls "like shed skin," becomes a pendant carrying "steady weight." The final image of chains "remembering how to open" offers a non-literal answer about reconciliation through accumulated particulars without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent atmospheric control through selective perception ("inkpots emptied but never washed," "wet rope tightening"). Minor convergence occurs in dialogue sections where captains' voices lack distinction, but Mara's perceptual signature remains strong throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong atmospheric density but shows template cadence in "Mara [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Information density is high—most sentences advance both atmosphere and story—though some metaphors strain ("ventricles" for staircases).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prisoner exchange negotiator as "neither jailer nor liberator, only the hinge" offers a fresh angle on diplomatic fiction. The drawer pull's evolution from furniture to talisman to pendant shows specific synthesis, though the moon-phase ritual feels somewhat conventional.</comment>
