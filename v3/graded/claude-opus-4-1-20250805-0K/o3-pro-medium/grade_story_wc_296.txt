I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through lyric imagery and pattern repetition toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Inyara's motivation crystallizes through embodied shame ("frozen in shame on the shore," "ached behind her ribs") and her contradictory impulses emerge in scene when she faces the mirror revealing her sister-abandonment. The final choice to "unbend" rather than break shows earned transformation with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("warlike serenity") that isn't fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds through expanding circles motif to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Inyara's unbending transforms her frozen confession into hope. The vision of her living sister ("roots bandaged around burned legs, still singing") provides concrete cost and closure. The pattern of circles within circles pays off when she uses the same technique on the ice mirror.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cursed lake and swirling orchard vortex actively constrain choices—Inyara must step on glowing rings, navigate spectral fruit corridors, and face thorned apples. The environment doesn't reach 9+ because while vivid ("roots and waters coiling together like two armies embracing"), it doesn't fundamentally shape the final transformation, which is internal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking a memory to confronting her deepest shame about abandoning her sister. The mirror trap forces genuine trade-off between self-punishment and unbending. Cost is legible when she names lost truths ("sister's laughter, ash scent, night rain") to thaw the ice, though the resolution feels slightly swift for the weight of guilt established.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of "what mirrors refuse to show"—truths beyond reflection requiring courage to face. The ending's vision of her sister alive but wounded offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire journey from guilt to hope. Strong integration of unbending versus breaking throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with mythic register ("skeins of mist twisted into branches") and selective perception focused on natural/magical elements. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("warlike serenity," "martial calm") but mostly maintains coherent POV. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong imagery. Deductions for repetitive constructions ("She touched...She stepped...She spoke") and some abstract phrases that could be more concrete ("warlike serenity" appears twice). Information density is good but some metaphors feel slightly strained ("two armies embracing").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of druid mythology with psychological confrontation—the flesh-eating seed that "devours lies" and reveals truth is inventive. The specific detail of finding "a king's sigh in a broken lute" shows originality. Doesn't reach higher bands because the core emotional arc (confronting guilt to find redemption) follows familiar patterns.</comment>
