<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between duty and mercy drives a credible arc, with contradictory impulses (following protocol vs. seeking "a softer ending") acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to sacrifice her heartbeat as metronome shows clear cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("bruised awe") that recurs without full embodiment, though the puppet head interaction grounds her emotional state effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara's sacrifice recalibrates time itself, creating "one more cradle song around the sun" with visible cost (her heartbeat offered). The nested patterns of gears/echoes/time build density toward the decisive act. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, Mara, her role) establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse mechanism with its brass gears and "nested patterns" constrains Mara's choices—she can only "tune" not stop the end. The puppet head's cracks storing memories and later sealing with gold effectively charges the final transformation. Sensory details like "salt cracked chamber" and "waves reflected last light" create atmosphere while the physical key enables the crucial action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from abstract duty to personal sacrifice as Mara moves from listening to the gears' "eight more revolutions" to inserting the dangerous key that risks "jammed cogs and her own unspooled existence." The cost manifests concretely when she relinquishes her heartbeat. One meaningful deepening occurs as the puppet head transforms the mechanism, forcing her ultimate choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between mechanical precision and human mercy—"beautifully flawed like a cracked bell made holy by echo." The puppet head's transformation from fractured relic to gold-veined whole mirrors the story's argument that imperfection can delay oblivion. The final image of Mara awaiting "the first infant cry of the renewed world" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm—"The tide crawled up the rocks like a tired creature as dusk bled into the hidden lighthouse." POV remains stable in close third, with Mara's perceptual signature showing in how she reads the gears' "secret language" and feels time as corridors. Some elevated diction ("vouchsafe") fits the mythic register though occasionally distances.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with varied sentence lengths creating rhythm, though "bruised awe" appears three times without variation. Information density high—most sentences advance both atmosphere and plot. Some figurative density in peak moments ("thunderless lightning stitched the horizon") but serves the lyric mode. Clear propulsion through the transformation sequence with no major loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of apocalyptic countdown with intimate human gesture—a doomsday clock adjuster who seeks lullabies rather than warnings. The puppet head as memory vessel and the concept of tuning rather than stopping the end show originality. The image of time having "corridors lined with versions of herself" and the personified apocalypse that "yawned" demonstrate imaginative specificity.</comment>
