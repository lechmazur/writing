I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and philosophical resonance rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's characterization succeeds through embodied perception ("stepped as if measuring invisible threads") and her choice to carry wisdom rather than speak it demonstrates clear motivation. The final renunciation of speech for preservation shows genuine cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around wisdom that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lira accepts the role of silent guardian, with cost visible in her commitment to anonymity and the weight settling "like a harmless stone." The accumulative structure builds effectively through ritual gestures. Slight deduction for abstract handling of the "echo of wisdom" which could be more tangibly rendered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The desert setting actively shapes choices—the kinetic parapet responds to "silent questions," the pavilion grants ceremonial hush, and the dunes provide the threads Lira walks. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("sand that sounded like applause smothered in velvet"). Environment consistently constrains and enables action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wisdom without corrupting it through speech—is established early and deepens through Lira's ritual preparation. The tension between speaking and preserving creates genuine pressure. Cost is visible in her acceptance of anonymity and the physical weight she carries.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between the prophet's departure and Lira's arrival, crystallizing in "Wisdom, once spoken, scatters; preserved, it walks." The recurring silence/speech tension and the physical architecture responding to mental states create resonant layers without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent mythic-philosophical register with controlled rhythm ("She stepped as if measuring invisible threads"). Perceptual signature is distinct—Lira reads the world through touch and peripheral awareness. Minor deduction for occasional elevation that slightly exceeds the intimate scale of the action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Some abstract phrasing around wisdom and echoes creates minor opacity but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept of wisdom as physical burden requiring silent preservation offers fresh angle on familiar prophet/disciple dynamics. The kinetic architecture responding to thought and the specific ritual of consecration show genuine originality within mythic framework.</comment>
