<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aarik's internal contradiction between "gentle radical" and "aberrant mercy" as weakness/future drives authentic tension throughout. His retrocognitive burden creates embodied suffering through barefoot walking and physical absorption of past pain. The final choice to rename the city crystallizes his values with visible cost—accepting the weight of history while forging forward.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory details (ash, tesserae, wind) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where renaming transforms the city's destiny. The closure lands with felt cost as Aarik channels the plaza's collective trauma through himself ("the voice emerging was not his alone"). Early orientation is clear; the pattern of accumulation toward transformation holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ancient plaza functions as more than setting—it's an active constraint forcing Aarik to confront embedded trauma through physical contact. Sensory details (ash like gray snow, stones trembling with memories, wind whistling through minarets) create atmospheric pressure. The mosaic tesserae constrain and enable the renaming ritual, making environment indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal burden (feeling the plaza's pain) through collaborative ritual (arranging tesserae) to collective transformation (renaming Solaryn). The dominant stake—whether aberrant mercy can heal historical trauma—tightens as each tessera placement changes the wind's pitch. Cost is visible in Aarik's physical channeling of voices and the sky's silver-veined scarring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "warm coldness" and "empathy in arms of steel"—healing requires embracing contradiction. The renaming from ruins to "Solaryn" (holding light within scars) offers a non-literal answer to whether mercy can transform trauma. The final image of "new stars...renamed by the hush of healed stone" reweights all prior suffering without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with purposeful compression ("steel begins in fire and ends in heart"). Perceptual signature shows through Aarik's synesthetic experience of hearing voices in glass. However, some passages drift toward elevated register ("futurally summoned," "anneal ruins into rebellions") that strain against the established texture, particularly in the final third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic control and imagery density, but several instances of abstract elevation harm momentum: "futurally summoned," "rebellions of kindness," "aberrant mercy can anneal." The phrase "retrocognitively trapped" appears twice without variation. Template structure emerges in "He saw...He spoke...He opened" sequence. These artifacts don't touch closure but accumulate in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of renaming a city through deciphering ancient mosaics to change destiny offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of trauma, memory, and transformation through physical tessera arrangement feels specific and earned. Risk-taking in the lyric mode and the paradoxical "warm coldness" throughout heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
