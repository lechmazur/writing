<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orin's silent acceptance of the covenant shows clear motivation through embodied action rather than exposition, with his "solitude throbbed for purpose" creating genuine internal tension. The ghosts' "eyeless sockets glowed with a plea" provides external pressure that forces his choice. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract "tangled covenant" lacking immediate specificity until later beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught silence and resonance building to Orin accepting the covenant as keeper, where "color seeped back into the dunes" shows visible transformation. The closure lands with clear cost—Orin binds himself to eternal stewardship, "allowing vows to resonate through him." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The abandoned apiary functions as more than setting—the "sticky echo" of honey drums literally maps Orin's path, and the "stained glass box caught the final rays, fracturing them into bruise colored halos" constrains how he must approach. The wasteland-to-color transformation at closure directly ties environment to stakes. Sensory detail like "pollen dust" and "waxen combs brittle as pottery" creates lived-in specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking the rumored box to accepting eternal stewardship, with the ghosts' pressure and the box's "iron vines [that] would snap if approached with haste" creating genuine obstacles. The cost manifests as Orin's permanent binding: "he would tend this covenant." One meaningful deepening occurs when understanding the settlers' history transforms his choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete image of silence preserving meaning—"preserve the weight of unspoken words"—without abstract moralizing. The final image of Orin's "silent promise across dunes like pollen riding wind" offers resonant answer to whether vows can transcend speech. The wax parchment "inscribed not with ink but with indentations" embodies theme through object.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism: "the hour after ghosts become visible, when the air shimmered with half confessed regrets." POV remains strictly limited to Orin's mute perception. Rhythm modulates effectively from contemplative opening to the accelerated transformation sequence. No dialogue appropriately reinforces the story's commitment to "mute eloquence."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid specificity like "emerald shards of long dried royal jelly," though occasional elevation strains: "choreography of quiet" feels slightly forced. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "He [verb]" structures. The closing image effectively recharges earlier motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghost story and environmental fable through the specific mechanism of silent beekeepers bound by vow. The concept of inheriting unspoken covenants through resonance rather than language shows genuine originality. The transformation from wasteland to renewed color through sound/vibration offers non-obvious resolution.</comment>
