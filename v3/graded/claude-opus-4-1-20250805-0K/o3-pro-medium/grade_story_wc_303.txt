<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's plant telepathy creates genuine internal tension between her gift and shame, driving her investigative choices with embodied specificity ("pulse throbbed a mulberry ache"). The final choice to trust the moss with the violin shows earned renunciation with visible cost—she releases control to nature's network rather than claiming the discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through botanical conduits spreading Solon's music, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where citizens remember "whose dream it had trampled." Cost lands explicitly: the empire's anthem wilts as vines perforate its fabric, and destiny "finally breathed true" through its holes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The velvet observatory's sensory details ("dust that smelled of stars") and the underground corridor's bronze door "punched with random constellations" constrain Liora's path and enable the violin's discovery. The ivy roots and peat moss function as active setting elements that propagate the music, charging the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to empire-wide revelation as the violin's music spreads through botanical networks, forcing the empire to confront its theft. The cost manifests physically ("Empire banners wilted") and conceptually as amnesia lifts, though the middle lacks a sharp tightening moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the contrast between imposed amnesia and organic memory—plants remember what empires erase. The final image of destiny "perforated" to breathe true offers resonant non-literal answer to whether dreams can survive empire, with the violin designed for "botanical conduits, nature's hidden auditoriums."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through botanical awareness ("lotus-skein hush," "scarce as midnight pollen"), though some metaphors strain ("velvet observatory"). Voice maintains consistency through pressure, with purposeful compression in the climactic propagation sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong information density and varied syntax, but overwriting appears in phrases like "frost-bright and brittle" and "tentative plum hope" that prioritize ornament over clarity. Some template structures emerge ("She understood...She lifted...She answered") though the prose maintains momentum through the closure sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The concept of plants as memory-keepers against empire offers fresh angle on resistance narrative, with specific detail like coffee-stain divination "adored by begonias." However, the magical realism framework of telepathic plant communication follows familiar patterns without full transformation.</comment>
