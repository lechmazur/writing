<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradictions—"here and gone" as both wound and organizing principle—drive authentic character evolution through embodied detail like flexing "the same inner rhythm over the blank." The crystallized time sequence shows conflicting impulses acting simultaneously (wanting him to stay while knowing the rule), and her final choice to leave the carving unfinished carries visible cost as purposeful absence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with crystallized time serving as the decisive intensification that reweights grief into creative practice. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration as Mara transforms "here and gone" from wound to reverence, with cost visible in the deliberately missing stroke—"Absence, too, can roar." The magical realism element is taught early through sensory cues and pays off when the lion's roar enters the wood.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The loft setting with its rain-beaded skylight creates atmospheric pressure while workshop details (linseed, sawdust, circus musk) ground the transformation. The ash blank functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—Mara must channel grief through this specific medium. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional shift from lion tamer's wife to artist, though some descriptions lean toward the poetic rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming grief into art before memories scatter—tightens through the crystallized time sequence where Mara must face both husband and lion. Cost becomes legible when she accepts incompletion as part of the work: "deciding the sculpture would never be finished, only paused at stages of telling." The kettle's boiling provides temporal pressure that forces action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the "here and gone" motif that evolves from pain to precision to reverence, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the deliberately unfinished carving offers a non-literal answer to handling loss—art contains what breath cannot hold. The sculpture's amber coloring from "drying sunset" and the missing stroke create resonance without stating meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm that modulates during the crystallized time sequence ("Drops froze against the glass, prismatic and still"). The perceptual signature—seeing through a circus performer's lens even in domesticity—remains distinct. Some elevated diction ("crystallized corridor," "rust-hued peace") occasionally strains but serves the accumulative pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful compression, though figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("Steam had not yet risen, but the water's shift marked the boundary of moments"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some abstract constructions ("hauntingly practical," "here and gone") risk opacity but are grounded through repetition and scene work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystallized time device offers a fresh angle on grief processing, avoiding typical flashback or memory structures. The specific synthesis of circus life with wood carving creates unexpected resonance. The choice to leave the sculpture deliberately unfinished transforms expected resolution, though some metaphorical constructions feel familiar ("contained every roar she remembered inside its grain").</comment>
