<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ila's internal conflict between duty and truth drives genuine stakes, with embodied tension ("gloves trembled," "pulse drumming") and a meaningful choice that forecloses her safe archival life. The Curator's parallel history and wet eyes add depth without resolution convenience. Deduction for some abstract phrasing ("bravely conflicted") and occasional tell-over-show in emotional states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with escalating density through discovery-transmission-witness-reply sequence, culminating in Resonant Reconfiguration where "the world shifts" carries clear cost (Ila's endangered position, irreversible breach). The closure lands with both characters accepting new vulnerability. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen library setting directly constrains choice (Alcove Seven without cameras, dormant networks in permafrost) and charges the final image of thaw. Vivid sensory work ("corridors breathed like distant lungs," "pewter glow") with POV-filtered perception. The ice/thaw metaphor threads throughout without becoming heavy-handed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal risk through technical challenge to shared conspiracy, with Ila's agency driving each turn. The Curator's arrival creates genuine pressure that resolves through alliance rather than conflict. Cost is visible in both characters' acceptance of danger, though the final reply arrives somewhat easily.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete ice/thaw imagery and the letter's content about architects building chains, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final "subtle as thaw, unstoppable as story" reweights all prior frozen/silence imagery. Minor deduction for slightly abstract moments ("latency can still scandalize").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful compression ("Snow hushed," "Silence normally soothed"). Some register elevation in peak moments slightly exceeds POV plausibility ("liaison letter, still warm from forbidden hands"). Dialogue minimal but effective when present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied sentence structures. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("dizzying quiet," "merciless chill") and some template phrasing patterns ("She wondered," "She pictured"). The final lines achieve genuine resonance without loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The frozen archive as keeper of "contraband truths" offers fresh angle on censorship narrative, with specific technical details (weather telemetry encryption) avoiding generic resistance story. The Curator's parallel history adds unexpected depth. Some familiar dystopian elements prevent higher score.</comment>
