<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "discover the texture of connection" drives concrete choices throughout, from cutting her own memory thread to save the structure to allowing visitors to reshape their pain. The internal contradiction between her need for control (mathematical precision) and surrender to chaos (memories must alter) creates genuine tension. However, visitor characterization remains thin despite their presence enabling the crucible moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through sinew threads tightening, doorways blossoming, and the final loosened threads "humming with low, forgiving light." The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara cuts her keystone memory, paying visible cost (losing her memory of learning to speak) to preserve the collective transformation. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 ("city's abandoned planetarium shortly before dusk").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The planetarium setting actively constrains choices—the dome's spherical architecture enables the geometric chalk patterns, the abandoned state allows private experimentation, and the physical structure threatens collapse when threads overtighten. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "dust motes erupted from the balcony rail in a glittering sigh," threads that "sang its taut, eerie note when plucked." The environment becomes the mechanism itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: threads tighten progressively, doorways multiply "like rings on water," until the structure threatens "to collapse into a single luminous knot." Mara's agency drives the resolution when she cuts her keystone thread, accepting permanent loss. The stake—whether connection can be woven without destroying all involved—faces direct test with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central paradox that "connection never resolves—only continues to be woven," earned through Mara's sacrifice of her foundational memory. The concept of "rational enchantment" gains depth as emotion's circuitry is literally exposed and rewoven. The final image of threads "humming with low, forgiving light" offers non-literal answer to whether human connection can be engineered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice employs architectural/scientific diction ("spherical halls," "equations to constellations") filtered through poetic compression ("blueprints rolled tight as prayer scrolls"). POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. However, dialogue is minimal and visitor voices lack distinction when they whisper confessions, missing opportunity for subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs: "architects built bridges of steel; she would span chasms of meaning." Some overwriting appears in metaphor density ("prayer scrolls," "patient beast," "quiet lightning" in opening paragraphs) without clear pattern-teaching. Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks that mirror the story's breathing pattern.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise of literally weaving memory alterations into architectural space using lab-grown sinew threads offers genuine freshness. The specific synthesis of scientific precision with emotional chaos, where memories must be "freshly distorted" for the process to work, transforms the familiar artist-as-creator trope. Risk-taking in the conceptual architecture pays off with coherent world-logic maintained throughout.</comment>
