I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to restore power is clear and embodied through concrete actions (climbing tower, solving riddle, installing ampoule). Bram's involuntary truthfulness creates genuine character specificity. The final choice to speak the ritual truth shows earned agency with visible cost (the city's restoration).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Decisive Change when protagonist restores city power through solving riddle and speaking truth, with visible cost (blackout's impact, ritual requirement). Causal lens holds: because drones failed → therefore blackout → therefore protagonist investigates → therefore solves riddle → therefore power restored. Opening orientation anchors who/where/when effectively within 120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lightning tower setting directly constrains choices (must climb, must solve riddle in hive chamber). Sensory details ("air tasted of copper," "amber coils," "violet light") create atmosphere while advancing plot. The lacquer box and ampoule function as micro-settings that enable the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring city power) signaled early and tested through riddle-solving sequence. Escalation occurs when touching the box causes pain but protagonist persists, then alarm triggers requiring truth-speaking. Cost is visible in the twelve-hour blackout's impact and the ritual's requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of "preserving wonder in routine maintenance" emerges organically through architect's riddle design and final realization that "lightning could light houses, but mystery could light hearts." The matchbox's question mark piercing lightning bolt emblem crystallizes this tension between utility and wonder without heavy-handedness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled metaphors ("nectar dusk," "chrome bees"). Bram's dialogue carries his truthful constraint naturally ("Truth slips from me like rain off slate"). POV remains stable in close third throughout with appropriate perceptual filtering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("fermented into that gentle nectar flavor") but doesn't obscure clarity. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor template cadence in drone awakening sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of repair drones as mechanical bees with a bottled lightning heart offers fresh angle on infrastructure fiction. "Nectar dusk" as both atmospheric detail and thematic echo shows originality. However, the wise architect leaving puzzles is somewhat familiar territory.</comment>
