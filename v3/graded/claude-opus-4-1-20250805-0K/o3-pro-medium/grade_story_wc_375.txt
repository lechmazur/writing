<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's creative block and relationship with her deceased sister create genuine emotional stakes, with the choice to deliberately forget her accumulated memories showing contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final renunciation of memory for raw creation lands with visible cost. Deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("auroral sorrow") and occasional therapy-speak rather than fully embodied states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memories transform into light and Elara's creative block releases through deliberate forgetting, with the crystal cave sealing as definitive closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as she trades her mnemonic gift for creative freedom. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some causality softness around how the journal pages spontaneously fill.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal cave constrains choice through its requirement of silence and memory sacrifice, with bioluminescent details and mineral taste creating vivid sensory texture. The crystals actively absorb memories and change color, making setting instrumental to transformation. Slight deduction for some generic descriptors ("violet gloom," "trembling rainbows") that could be more specific to this particular cave.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from creative paralysis to confronting sister's death to sacrificing perfect memory, with each deepening forcing harder choices. The cost is legible as Elara must speak aloud and release each remembered portrait to unlock creativity. Deduction because the middle section relies somewhat on discovery rather than active pressure, though the final sacrifice lands with clear agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of artistic sacrifice emerges through concrete action as Elara trades technical perfection for raw creative force, with the crystals keeping her laughter "safe forever" providing resonant closure. The sister's message about "release it or be forever dusk" avoids preaching while crystallizing the central question. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit thematic echo in "some callings cannot be escaped, only answered."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through charcoal-stained fingers and memory-focused observation, with controlled psychic distance shifts during the descent and transformation. Voice maintains consistency through lyrical compression. Deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't fully match Elara's established lexicon ("mnemonically gifted," "inescapable calling") and some filter-verb clustering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong sensory details, but several instances of elevated diction clash with established voice ("auroral sorrow," "rectified the damage"). Template cadence appears in places ("She remembered...she spoke...she set up"). The paraphrase loop around "calling" and some abstract emotional labeling reduce momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of an artist sacrificing perfect memory for creative freedom offers a fresh angle on creative block, with the underground gallery of unfinished portraits providing specific visual originality. The transformation from memory-keeper to pure creator feels earned. Deduction for some familiar elements (dead sister motivation, mystical cave) that aren't fully transformed beyond their archetypal roots.</comment>
