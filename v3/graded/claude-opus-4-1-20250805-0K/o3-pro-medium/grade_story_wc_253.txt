<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marrow's blank affect and performative narration create a distinctive character whose moral ambiguity ("saint or swindler") drives the central tension. Ithica's grief is embodied through red eyes and painted smile, with his final acceptance of both "lightness inside the weight" earning genuine transformation through the cedar lamp scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds through Marrow's narrated mundane tasks toward Earned Stasis—Ithica accepts grief alongside memory in the "remade hush." The cedar lamp's "pale gold shimmer" provides visible transformation with cost acknowledged ("Your grief is heavier because the world demands you float"), though the inspector arrival feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Wind turbines as "slow machinery" casting "perpetual shadow" establish oppressive atmosphere that mirrors emotional suppression. The cedar lamp's channels that "funnel invisible light" and the dried flowers' brittle petals create tactile specificity that constrains choices—the lamp literally enables compliance while preserving authentic grief.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake of authentic grief versus mandated happiness escalates through Marrow's narrated whittling ("carving a corridor where sorrow may walk") to the inspector confrontation. The lamp's glow enabling "perfect compliance" while maintaining the "remade hush" shows meaningful deepening, though physical stakes could intensify.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete actions—whittling becomes "desperate epic," dried flowers "remember what promise cost." The final "space where grief could float lightly alongside memory" reweights the mandate's hollow happiness without stating a moral, earning resonance through accumulated particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marrow's elevated performative diction ("kettle's weary pilgrimage") contrasts effectively with narrative restraint. POV maintains consistent distance with selective perception ("machinery halts abruptly"), though some phrases like "engineered silence" and "emotional void" lean toward abstraction rather than embodied observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong rhythmic variation and imagery ("blades slicing clouds into obedient ribbons"), but occasional abstract phrasing ("emotional void," "engineered silence") and slight redundancy in describing the hush. The whittling sequence maintains excellent momentum through concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The happiness mandate dystopia gets fresh treatment through intimate scale and the cedar lamp's non-electric glow. Marrow's blank-faced performance art that narrates mundane tasks offers an original response to enforced emotion, though the inspector resolution feels slightly predictable.</comment>
