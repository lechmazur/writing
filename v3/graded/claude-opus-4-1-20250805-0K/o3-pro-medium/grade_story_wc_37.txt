<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's transformation from rigid archivist to understanding that memories must "breathe together" drives genuine change with visible cost—the destruction of the logbook. Interior contradiction between duty and growing awareness plays out through concrete actions (tearing pages, singing). The swaddled guide functions well as catalyst but lacks depth as a secondary character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and memories layer toward the Resonant Reconfiguration where rigid archiving gives way to communal weaving. The mica window opening and subsequent transformation carries clear cost—abandoning the narrator's identity as memory keeper. Orientation anchors (alchemical orchard, greenhouse, memory keeper role) establish by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse-as-mirror-world revelation recontextualizes the entire setting brilliantly. Crystallized fruit growing from memories, mercury sap, and "cathedral built by roots desiring conversation" create vivid, purposeful detail that constrains choices—the narrator must physically approach the mica window through this specific landscape. The setting transformation at closure (greenhouse to open forest) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from maintaining order to save dying lamps toward understanding that separation itself causes the realm's death. The narrator's tearing of the logbook represents meaningful agency with clear cost—abandoning their life's work. However, the swaddled guide's appearance feels slightly convenient rather than earned through protagonist pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully through the contrast between archival separation and communal weaving—"bound release" manifests as simultaneous holding and letting go. The final image of trees and shadows singing together to knot dawn threads offers resonant answer without stating moral. "Not to imprison memories, but to swaddle them until they could fly" reweights the entire keeper role.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinctive poetic voice maintains consistency through "bruised petals," "sullen embers," "mercury sap." Perceptual signature shows in how the narrator notices order and disorder ("linear rows," "stratified life"). Minor weakness in dialogue—the swaddled figure's whisper reads slightly generic compared to surrounding prose texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong figurative coherence throughout ("dawn thicker than silk," "shadows grew roots"). Information density high—most sentences advance both literal and thematic layers. Some filter verb clustering ("I realized," "I sensed") in middle section slightly dulls immediacy. Final paragraph's "swaddle them until they could fly" risks mild thematic echo but earns through concrete imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse-as-reflection concept with true sky waiting behind offers fresh angle on portal fantasy. Risk-taking in the lyrical density and abstract elements (memories as fruit, singing to weave dawn) heightens stakes while maintaining clarity. The synthesis of archival order versus communal chaos feels non-obvious and earned.</comment>
