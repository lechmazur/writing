I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor assessing its publishability in a prestigious literary publication.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant with Causal elements). The story builds through sensory accumulation and pattern-building toward a resonant reconfiguration where collective rebellion transforms the experiment's purpose.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ira's "quietly rebellious" nature manifests through concrete actions (lemon juice annotations, tapping disruption) that drive the closure. Internal contradiction between wanting healing and suspecting "memories prefer knots" creates authentic tension. The final choice to release her sister's memory shows earned agency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as collective rebellion transforms the experiment from institutional control to shared nurturing. The cost is legible: "dreams breathed together cannot be owned." The hybrid lens holds as accumulative sensory details build toward causal rebellion. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden functions as active setting—frequencies "glowing like breathing flowers" constrain and enable the experiment. Sensory details ("liquid light rippled," "auric lagoon") aren't merely descriptive but shape how memory-sharing manifests. The crystalline stump becomes Ira's instrument of rebellion, making environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual therapy to collective memory-sharing to rebellion against institutional control. Ira's tapping introduces "little syncopations" that cascade into system-wide disruption. The cost lands clearly: memories become "wild vines" escaping protocol, with the director's pale realization confirming the price of lost control.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between institutional control and organic memory. The final whisper that "dreams breathed together cannot be owned, only nurtured" reweights the entire experiment without moralizing. The sister's transformation from "lost" to "woven" offers resonant answer to whether healing requires untangling or accepting knots.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "hum inside her skull matched the deep bass." Voice modulates effectively from clinical observation to lyric intensity ("auroral sorrow seeped into Ira"). Some filter verbs ("felt," "sensed") slightly dull immediacy in middle passages but don't compromise closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves lyric density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The hush of the universe inhaling"). Some redundancy appears mid-story ("Ira felt...she felt"), and occasional abstract phrasing ("patient grief she did not yet understand") weakens immediacy. Strong propulsion in final third compensates.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of entangled memories sharing across minds offers fresh angle on collective consciousness. Ira's quiet rebellion through rhythm—"drumming on everything"—provides unexpected resistance method. The transformation from institutional experiment to organic collective creation feels earned and non-obvious.</comment>
