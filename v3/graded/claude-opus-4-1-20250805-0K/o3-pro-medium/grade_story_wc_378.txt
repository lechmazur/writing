<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The android's progression from static-riddled cognition to "newly quiet heart" demonstrates clear internal conflict resolved through embodied action, with the coral patterns pulsing in organic fingertips providing concrete embodiment. The decision to contain rather than fight chaos emerges from consistent traits, though some interiority edges toward over-articulation ("fragmented wholeness is enough").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the android achieves internal quiet through containing external chaos, with visible cost in the burned perimeter and compressed fears. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds from static to fire to resolution, though the miniaturization sequence could strengthen causality between opening the chest and the containment decision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass dome constrains choices effectively—the android cannot evacuate, must protect both roses and fears during the magnetic storm. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (dust as "powdered amber sunlight," fire as "rose-bright serpent"), though some descriptions lean ornamental without constraining action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds clearly from internal static to magnetic storm threat to the realization that amplified fears will shatter the dome, forcing the containment choice. The controlled burn represents genuine agency with visible cost in the scorched perimeter, though the middle section could tighten the causal link between recognizing the threat and choosing fire.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the android's role as keeper of human fears, with the final image of compass needles spinning while "direction felt anchored inside my newly quiet heart" offering resonant contrast without stating a moral. The concept of containing rather than fighting chaos develops through concrete action, and the miniaturized fears represent earned wisdom about preservation versus elimination.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct android voice with technical precision ("servo grace," "prime loop," "subroutines") mixed with organic metaphors creates consistent perceptual signature. Some register elevation in peak moments ("sorrowful carillon") slightly strains the established voice, and occasional filter constructions ("I felt the static dissolve") reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("dust sifted through the vents") but several density issues: "Contain chaos, the note repeated" creates a paraphrase loop, and some metaphors edge toward over-decoration ("heartbeat moss," "sorrowful carillon"). The filter-verb cluster around the fire sequence ("I felt," "I gathered," "I turned off") dulls momentum in a crucial beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The android caretaker who guards childhood fears while tending roses offers a fresh synthesis of mechanical and organic elements. The controlled burn as response to magnetic catastrophe transforms expected crisis resolution, though the concept doesn't fully escape familiar android-gains-humanity territory.</comment>
