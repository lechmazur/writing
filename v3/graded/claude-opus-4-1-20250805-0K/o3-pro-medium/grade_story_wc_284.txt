<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("prudently daring steps," tension stitching into shoulders "like sutures"). The final choice to repair trust carries visible cost through the burned faces and years of exile. Minor deduction for slight emotional summary in "everything broken she meant to fix."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught cipher system paying off in closure. Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis—they choose to repair rather than abandon, with cost visible in their "cauterized choices" and seven years lost. The gear repair crystallizes as both literal and metaphoric healing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Environment constrains choices through the bluff's isolation and snow as writing medium. The gear from the destroyed clock tower charges the final image of "a clock newly wound." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from ascent to descent with mist as atmospheric pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: glyphs written, figure emerging, gear revealed, collaborative repair. The dominant stake (whether trust can be rebuilt) tightens when they work "side by side" with visible cost in their matched burns. Minor limitation: the resolution feels slightly predetermined once Elias appears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the gear metaphor—"Fixing what's broken is not the same as pretending it never shattered." The final image of descending together with "repaired trust ticking" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Strong complexity in accepting damage while choosing repair.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature through spy-specific observations ("codes in accumulated snow," "language of spies"). Controlled modulation from silver hush to "almost melodic" brightness. Minor register elevation in some metaphors ("hinge inside their ribs align") slightly exceeds POV naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting in metaphor density ("critic tugging at a frayed script," "sutures," "gold seed in barren soil") creates slight coherence friction. Template cadence appears briefly ("She paused...She added...then straightened").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spy thriller with clock repair metaphor creates non-obvious emotional terrain. The "prudently daring" paradox and matched burns offer specific texture. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure serves the reconciliation arc well.</comment>
