<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cressida's trait of wilting near dishonesty creates genuine constraint that drives her journey to the Archive, and her final transformation from isolation to communal truth-telling shows earned change with visible cost. The piece effectively embodies her physical reactions to lies and her unfurling "like a revived vine" when honesty returns, though Fen remains somewhat functional rather than fully realized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with seeds of lost conversations literally germinating to cleanse the toxic sky—a Resonant Reconfiguration where honesty becomes the mechanism for environmental healing. The closure lands with visible cost (the dead lily, the toxic sky) transformed through collective truth-telling, though the causality of how archived conversations physically purify air strains slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic skies creates constant pressure through "humidity hissing against glass arches" and quarantine gates, with the dead oasis lily's absence haunting every choice. The Archive of Unuttered Things and translucent seeds pulsing with voices provide vivid, constraint-driving specificity that shapes the final image of words spiraling upward to cleanse the air.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal (Cressida's need for honesty) through discovery (the map and Archive) to communal transformation as citizens join in planting truth-seeds. The dominant stake—whether honesty can restore a poisoned world—tightens when they realize conversations must return to their soil, though the resolution relies somewhat on magical thinking about how truth cleanses toxins.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically through the metaphor of archived unspoken truths as seeds awaiting germination, with the final image of "unhidden words, promising eventual bloom" resonating without moralizing. The piece earns its wisdom that "candor in small moments could tilt a world" through dramatized discovery rather than assertion, though the mechanism borders on allegory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent close-third with distinctive touches like "gilded-leaf calligrapher" and "iron fruit," modulating effectively from intimate observation to communal witness. Dialogue between Cressida and Fen carries naturalistic subtext about their shared losses, though occasional elevated diction ("brittle sigh," "exhaled") slightly strains the POV's register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("mail sleds hung like iron fruit") with strong information density and varied rhythm, particularly in discovery sequences. However, some template patterns emerge ("She packed...then stepped," "One by one") and abstract phrases like "visible cost" and "truthful seed" lean toward conceptual summary rather than embodied imagery in places.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of a greenhouse city archiving unspoken truths in seed form offers fresh synthesis, with the transformation of environmental toxicity through released honesty providing non-obvious resonance. The piece commits fully to its premise that dishonesty literally poisons air while truth cleanses it, though the metaphor occasionally announces itself.</comment>
