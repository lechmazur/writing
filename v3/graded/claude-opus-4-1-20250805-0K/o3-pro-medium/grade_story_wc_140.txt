I'll evaluate this story through the lens of Accumulative/Textural drive, as the narrative builds through layered fragments and sensory details toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than causal plot turns.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to collect erased histories while being officially dead creates compelling internal tension. The physical memory of poison ("My throat remembers the metallic sting") and the choice to leave the label as a calling card demonstrate embodied emotion and meaningful micro-choices. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "texture of memories" that could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with the closure achieving Resonant Reconfiguration through the narrator's acceptance of namelessness to amplify collected stories. The cost is legible in "I must stay an empty line on a blank form" - the surrender of identity for witness. The refrigerated container discovery and retreat create meaningful deepening without requiring causal reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The port labyrinth constrains movement and shapes the narrator's tactics ("I follow strands of turquoise paint"). Sensory details filter through the narrator's altered perception ("Sounds arrive first, images later"). The shipping containers function as both physical maze and metaphor for erased histories, though some descriptions lean abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the discovery sequence: finding the poison label triggers memory, then footsteps force hiding, revealing others hunt this "ghost who steals evidence." The tide's rhythm creates temporal pressure. Cost appears in accepting erasure to continue collecting, though the physical danger could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the accumulation of erased histories and the narrator's role as unofficial archivist. The final lines "histories do not vanish; they only wait for someone whose perception filters reality differently" offer resonant non-literal answer to the central question of memory and erasure without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "I filter reality differently after that near-poisoned night. Sounds arrive first, images later, names not at all." The prose rhythm modulates with scene pressure, tightening during the chase sequence. Voice remains consistent through the lyric-philosophical register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong moments like "cranes, a towering labyrinth of shipping containers rose like stacked dusk-coloured tombstones" show controlled imagery. Some abstract passages ("texture of memories," "layer what fragments I gather") create minor opacity. The final third maintains momentum despite philosophical density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of a bureaucratic error creating a ghost-witness offers fresh angle on memory and erasure. The specific detail of "municipal files" and "clerical flaws make generous loopholes" grounds the concept. The synthesis of port setting with archival mission feels organic rather than forced.</comment>
