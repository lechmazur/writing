<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation to deliver an overdue apology she helped create drives consistent choices through perfume-bait and Tesla coil tactics, with internal conflict between her gossip-columnist past and exorcist present creating genuine tension. The ghost's counter-accusation forces her to confront her role in the tragedy, and her final choice to place the bottle on the stump shows earned change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens builds through lilac-electricity-music layers toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marisol's "imperfect miracle" transforms from ghost-exorcism to self-absolution, with the orchard's stay of execution marking temporal cost. The closure lands with "fragile channel for whatever absolution remains" acknowledging the incomplete nature of redemption while the persistent lilac suggests ongoing penance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sheet music archive with "alto clefs and dust floating in equal measure" creates tactile specificity, while the orchard's countdown clock constrains timing and the Tesla coil's blue sparks writing "accidental sharps of lightning" merge setting with action. The perfume bottle functions as micro-setting that enables the ghost's manifestation and later becomes a memorial marker.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional column deadline through ghost-hunting to personal culpability when Dulio reveals "I had printed the first rumor," forcing Marisol from exorcist to penitent. The orchard's noon deadline creates external pressure while her choice to channel Dulio's music through her body shows agency accepting physical cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "imperfect miracle" concept emerges through Marisol's incomplete absolution and Dulio's partial release, with the lilac-as-memory motif charging both seduction and regret. The final image of unfading lilac on the stump offers non-literal answer: some apologies travel forever seeking their listener.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marisol's voice blends journalistic precision ("gossip-column exorcist") with lyrical perception ("Fog clung like gauze"), maintaining consistency through electrical possession without losing her core register. Dulio's ghost speaks in musical metaphors ("a chord missing its middle note") distinct from Marisol's more grounded diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong moments like "blue sparks crawled over filing cabinets, writing accidental sharps of lightning" show precise image-making, but occasional abstraction ("Perfect time for imperfect miracles") and mild redundancy in the gossip-apology connection reduce density. The prose maintains momentum through varied sentence lengths and clear spatial choreography of the archive scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "gossip-column exorcist" profession freshly combines journalism with supernatural intervention, while the Tesla coil method for ghost-stirring shows specific invention. The transformation of exorcism into self-absolution through shared culpability offers genuine complexity, though the ghost-with-regrets premise itself is familiar.</comment>
