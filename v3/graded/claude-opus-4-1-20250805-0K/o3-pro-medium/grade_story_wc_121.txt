I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern accumulation, procedural repetition of choices, and density shifts rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ira's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like touching droplets and wiping away tyrant-versions. The contradiction between her weightlessness and gravity's "fond" return creates genuine character complexity. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("periodically eternal") that lacks immediate embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Ira emerges carrying "darkening brightness meant to light others without burning them" - cost is visible through the extinction of alternate selves. The accumulative lens holds as choices compound through the corridor sequence. Slight weakness in the middle section's pacing through abstract concepts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The viaduct setting actively constrains choices through its shifting architecture and the suspended rainlake creates a unique "editors' room of reality." Environmental details like "dripping arches cast prismatic shadows" integrate with action. The setting transformation at closure (arches now "breathe") charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the procedural corridor choices and culminate in Ira composing "a life pattern that left power diffused and love concentrated." The cost of extinguishing alternate selves is visceral: "countless Iras howled as their corridors collapsed." One meaningful deepening through the droplet selection satisfies scope requirements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of timeline editing and the cost of self-selection. The "darkening brightness" motif effectively captures the paradox of enlightenment's potential harm. Some abstract philosophizing ("survival meant choosing which fragment of herself would earn sunrise") slightly dulls the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with inventive phrases like "between the drop and the ripple" and "allegiance to weight were optional." Perceptual signature consistent through selective details. Minor register drift into elevated diction ("chronology locals named") that occasionally strains against the fantastical premise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery, but several instances of abstract density that slow momentum: "periodically eternal, a being who cycles not through days but through recognitions." Some paraphrase loops around the concept of choice multiplication. The closing lines achieve strong propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of timeline manipulation with physical architecture creates an original premise. The concept of "procedural generation" applied to identity reconstruction shows genuine ingenuity. The specific image of droplets as life sketches awaiting permanence transcends typical time-travel tropes.</comment>
