<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's "fiercely, logically emotional" nature manifests through concrete action—threading copper wire while calculating resonance paths—rather than labels. The contradictory impulses between engineering precision and protective love play out in scene, particularly when she feels frequencies "reading her intentions as if bone were parchment." Callix remains functional rather than fully realized, limiting relationship dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through sonic layering—tuning forks, resonance paths, sympathetic iceberg chimes—toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the barricade weighs hearts and amplifies greed back as "terrible mirror of sound." Cost is visible as raiders retch and flee their "resounding shame," while Callix collapses spent. The closure lands with Mara's "belief was unnecessary when evidence rang so clear," though the final aurora signature feels slightly detached from the sonic throughline.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina with "crusted floes clinked like glassware" and "icicle chandeliers" that quiver from hummed notes creates atmosphere that matters—ice provides sympathetic resonance for the sonic defense. The lighthouse beacon becomes essential infrastructure for anchoring frequencies to "stone and salt." Environmental constraint drives the solution, though some descriptions ("fleshly ethereal") strain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from rumored raid to actual attack, with the sonic barricade forcing raiders to confront their own greed as physical revulsion. The dominant stake—protecting the relic that maintains coastal order—faces concrete test when the "black cutter slicing crimson water" arrives. Cost manifests as Callix's exhaustion and raiders' visceral shame, though the resolution feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete mechanism of "vibrational matching" that accepts only "contrite hearts," making moral worth physically measurable. The final exchange about belief versus evidence resonates without moralizing, as Mara's "rare thaw" suggests transformation through experience. The concept of sound reading intentions "neither judged nor praised, simply known" offers complexity without false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent formality with purposeful compression—"Circuit met solfeggio; engineering greeted repentance"—though occasionally strains into purple territory ("fleeting golden sunset that painted fjords with trembling apricot fire"). Mara's engineering perspective shapes perception effectively ("plotting resonance paths like lighthouse beam sweeps"), but dialogue remains minimal and functional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Icebergs chimed in sympathetic reply") but several overwrought passages dilute impact: "last light gave every breath a visible soul, making the air taste simultaneously fleshly ethereal." Some template constructions appear ("Mara watched as," "Others crawled") and the final aurora image feels tacked on rather than earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of engineering and acoustics to create moral-sonic defense offers fresh angle on protection magic, with specific detail about tuning forks, copper wire, and resonance paths grounding the concept. The idea that sound can weigh hearts and amplify their contents back transforms familiar judgment tropes through concrete mechanism, though execution occasionally relies on convenient physics.</comment>
