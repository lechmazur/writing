<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Corvin's motivation to preserve truth through physical evidence rather than myth is clear and consistent, driving his ascent and the final collaboration. The internal tension between his "abrasive calm" and creeping doubt when confronted by Mara creates genuine conflict. Minor deduction for Mara's somewhat convenient appearance and instant philosophical opposition without more grounding in their shared past.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through sedimentary metaphors toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where both philosophers accept hybrid truth-seeking. The cog's placement in the sextant creates a decisive moment with clear cost—both must abandon pure positions. Orientation anchors (post-plague sunken city, Corvin in sewer) establish cleanly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The drowned city setting brilliantly constrains movement (timed to low tide) and shapes discovery (maritime museum as lagoon). Sensory details like "algae-filtered dusk" and "lotus sprouting from shattered figureheads" create vivid atmosphere while the sedimentary layers literally structure the truth-seeking method. The environment forces collaboration in the flooded vault.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds from solitary philosophizing to confrontation with Mara to joint descent through museum layers, with the cog-sextant revelation forcing both to reconfigure their positions. The cost is legible—each must sacrifice ideological purity. Stakes could intensify further if their philosophical divide had more immediate consequences beyond abstraction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the sedimentary metaphor—truth exists in layers between pure data and pure narrative. The final planetarium image showing "plague years shrank to a blip within grander cycles" offers resonant perspective without moralizing. The synthesis of "custodians, carrying both cog and chart" avoids false binaries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with philosophical precision ("rationally rebellious," "stratified truth") and maritime vocabulary fitting the drowned setting. Some register elevation in peak moments ("competing narratives met between them, hovering like blurred coordinates") slightly strains the established tone. Dialogue between Corvin and Mara effectively captures their philosophical positions through subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong metaphorical coherence around water/navigation/sedimentation. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("Roofs became reefs, avenues became canals"). Minor template cadence in middle section ("He believed...To pry...Thus he agonized") and slight overwriting in "hovering like blurred coordinates neither could chart."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with philosophical inquiry through maritime archaeology creates an original angle. The sedimentary truth-seeking method and image of philosophers as "custodians" rather than victors transforms expected post-disaster narratives. The specific detail of the chronometer cog in the sextant mechanism grounds the abstract in concrete discovery.</comment>
