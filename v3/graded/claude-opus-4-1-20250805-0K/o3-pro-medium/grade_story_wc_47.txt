<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's quiet proactivity manifests through concrete micro-choices (mapping constellation, harvesting resin, offering pendant) that build toward earned connection. The internal contradiction between watchful distance and active care plays out through embodied action rather than declaration. Minor deduction for Rowan's emotional arc feeling slightly compressed in the transition from tears to smile, though the salt-as-mineral image partially earns it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details (moss hum, condensation trails, resin flakes) build toward Resonant Reconfiguration where two isolated figures find shared purpose in transforming a dead space. The cost is visible in Rowan's tears becoming "another mineral" and both accepting vulnerability "monitored only by moss." The pattern of transformation (servers→garden, wounds→growth) charges the final image of dreamers "wrapped in roots they had chosen together."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The abandoned data center functions as active constraint and enabler—its moss-colonized servers provide both sanctuary and materials (resin, mapping surface) that shape choices. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's botanical focus (chlorophyll hum, velvet moss, electrolyte and loam) while the "ghost codes" and "data ghosts" maintain technological memory. The setting constrains action to quiet, tactile work that enables connection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Mara's solitary healing work to shared transformation when Rowan's arrival forces her choice between maintaining distance or offering sanctuary. The dominant stake (finding protected space for growth after exposure) tightens through concrete actions—from solo mapping to paired harvesting to offering the pendant. Cost is legible in accepting another's "salt" into the garden's "slow circuitry."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of technological ruins into living space, with the amber pendant's trapped gnat embodying persistence despite stasis. The final image of dreamers "wrapped in roots they had chosen together" offers resonant answer to whether healing can match harm's scale. Subtext operates through gesture (proffering pendant "without ceremony") and image (constellation mapping as "deliberate cartography").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains distinct perceptual signature through botanical/technological fusion ("chlorophyll hummed in hollow towers," "electrolyte and loam") and controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. Dialogue carries subtext effectively (Mara's single word "come," Rowan's voice "thick with fear"). Minor compression in final paragraph's diction remains coherent with established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs (setting/character/atmosphere in "honeyed hush felt like gauze over a bruise"). Some figurative density in opening creates slight opacity ("honeyed hush" appears twice). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph structure, though "watchful dreamer" and similar constructions edge toward template phrasing without crossing into artifact territory.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital decay and botanical renewal creates non-obvious metaphor for processing public confession's aftermath. The specific detail of using server resin as seedling adhesive shows inventive problem-solving. Risk-taking in the quiet, tactile resolution rather than confrontation serves the theme of small-scale healing, though the ecological reclamation trope is somewhat familiar.</comment>
