<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to interpret celestial signals and find beginnings in endings is consistently embodied through concrete actions like tuning by "discarding assumptions one breath at a time." Her internal experience ("serenely electric despite the cold") differs meaningfully from external calm. The sacrifice of her receiver to repurpose the fragment shows clear value hierarchy with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the fragment's transformation revives the dead city and river, with Mara pocketing "only warm glass" as visible cost. Causality holds as the lunar perigee enables the signal, which leads to finding the fragment, which enables the revival. The "new questions assembling" beneath the silence crystallizes Mara's ongoing role.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city constrains choices (no power for lifts forces the glider use) and the gorge geography shapes the entire quest. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"air smelled like struck quartz," fog "pulsed in squares." The setting transformation at closure (lights winking on, river reborn) directly manifests the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from receiving a signal to physical descent into the gorge to sacrificing her receiver—each choice narrows options. The dominant stake (finding beginnings in endings to combat homeland silence) coheres through meaningful deepening as Mara must "let go of gravity, of language, of failure." Cost is visible: the fragment becomes "only warm glass" and she must "crank back upward."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete act of repurposing the Hollywood fragment—transforming an ending (dead star) into a beginning (revived city). The recurring "serenely electric" links Mara's internal state to the fragment's charge, paying off when it spends that charge. The final image of Mara "whistling a brand-new overture" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Mara's technical yet poetic processing—"hush so sharp it felt like glass sliding between heartbeats." Some elevated diction ("embryonic beginnings," "miserly dream") occasionally drifts from the established register. Voice modulates effectively with intensity, particularly in the surrender sequence where syntax fragments appropriately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, but some figurative density clusters without payoff ("nimbus," "wandering photons," "mythic in the freshly born acoustics"). Template cadence appears briefly ("She reached...She felt...She placed"). The prose achieves momentum through varied paragraph lengths and strategic compression of the ascent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of a celestial signal interpreter in an abandoned tower city offers fresh synthesis. The specific transformation—Hollywood star fragment becoming a catalyst for revival—avoids generic resolution. Risk-taking in the lyric mode and the "discarding assumptions" method creates non-obvious stakes, though some metaphorical choices ("embryonic beginnings") lean toward familiar territory.</comment>
