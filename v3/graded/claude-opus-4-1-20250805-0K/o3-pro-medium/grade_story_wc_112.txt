I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to prove time's lateral movement is clear and drives her risky lever-pull with visible stakes. Her internal conflict between scientific pursuit and ethical responsibility toward the creatures creates genuine tension, particularly when she realizes she's "unzipped the creatures' sense of rest." The characterization avoids stock phrasing and embodies emotion through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal lens with Maren's theory leading to action, creating temporal distortion, then requiring correction. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where she gains proof but accepts ethical constraints, with visible cost in her promise to seek consent. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The research station's architecture actively constrains choices—Maren must climb the central spar and access the sky foundry to reach the lever. Sensory details like "cryo-mist glittered like broken glass" and "violet sheets that rippled sideways" support the otherworldly atmosphere. The setting doesn't quite reach 9+ because the environment could constrain the final choice more directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (proving lateral time before funding expires) escalates through Maren's lever-pull, creating the temporal distortion that threatens the creatures' wellbeing. The reversal when she must "stitch the deck closed" creates genuine cost. Agency drives the escalation, though the resolution's speed slightly dampens the pressure's peak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of scientific ambition versus ethical responsibility emerges organically through Maren's actions and the creatures' disturbed rest. The final image of carrying "icy warmth in her pockets like twin suns" resonantly captures the duality without stating a moral. The sideways time concept literalizes and enriches the thematic question of progress's unintended consequences.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice maintains a distinctive blend of technical precision and poetic observation ("poets navigate silence"). The perceptual signature stays consistent with Maren as "sky mechanic" noticing mechanical details alongside organic responses. No dialogue to evaluate, but the internal voice remains coherent through pressure without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("incandescent," "magnosaurs") that slightly strains the POV's established register, though the overall clarity and momentum remain strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sideways time concept offers a fresh angle on temporal manipulation, avoiding typical time-travel tropes. The specific synthesis of xenobiology station, magnetic nexus alignment, and ethical consideration of non-human consciousness creates an original configuration. The risk-taking with the temporal visualization ("deck of cards fanned sideways") heightens stakes effectively.</comment>
