I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Determination:** This operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens - the story builds through sensory details, atmospheric pressure, and pattern accumulation rather than strict causality. The "reeling hush" transforms to "vigilant hush" through density increase rather than plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation as a "persistent listener" drives her investigation credibly, with embodied responses ("felt it twang along her nerves," "lungs tight"). The internal curiosity remains consistent, though her emotional arc could deepen further under the strange circumstances. Minor deduction for limited contradiction between professional duty and personal wonder.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration - the discovery transforms the "reeling hush" into "vigilant hush" with clear cost (draining her lantern's power). The accumulative structure coheres well, building from investigation through discovery to release. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The conservatory setting actively shapes investigation path and closure - from atrium to stairwell to seed vault. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("mist thick as milkglass," "wet stone and forgotten fertilizer"). The underground vault constrains choices and enables resolution. Environment directly participates in the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure builds through accumulating sensory signals - from whisper to ticks to giggle to coordinates. The dominant stake (protecting vulnerable voices) tightens when Mira discovers the trapped recordings. Cost is visible when she sacrifices her lantern's power. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy's true nature is revealed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the discovery that "incidental heroism was simply acting when coincidence named you." The preserved voices/seeds parallel works without forcing. The final image of Mira hearing "every living heart" resonantly answers the opening's isolation. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit heroism definition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with selective noticing ("reeling hush," focus on sound/pulse). Voice maintains consistency through pressure, though some phrases edge toward purple ("bleeding toward night"). The POV remains controlled without leakage. Rhythm effectively modulates with discovery beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures. Some overwriting in figurative language ("glass roof cracked, ivy threading iron ribs like green veins"). Repetition of "persistently curious" reads as intentional pattern. Minor loops with "reeling hush" variations. Information density is high but occasionally tips into density for its own sake.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The bioacoustic seed vault concept offers genuine freshness - preserved children's voices linked to seeds. The transformation of a ghost story into ecological preservation narrative subverts expectations. Specific details like "micro-oscillators" and the caretaker's drowning create originality. Some elements feel slightly convenient (the hearing aid's perfect compatibility).</comment>
