I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is primarily an **Accumulative/Textural** piece with elements of Causal. The retrocognitive seizures, layered temporal experiences, and final resonant image of the lagoon becoming "storied" rather than "starless" accumulate meaning through density and pattern. I'll judge under this lens.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions like tracing signatures with gloved fingers and arranging debris as messages. The retrocognitive seizures create genuine internal conflict between past and present. However, the temporal figure lacks sufficient contradictory impulses, and some emotional transitions feel summarized rather than embodied ("tears evaporating in the briny night air").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the lagoon transforms from "starless" to "storied," with clear cost in Mara's tears and the permanent alteration of her relationship to memory. The accumulative structure coheres well through retrocognitive episodes building toward the parley. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical transition "After the letters are found" which disrupts flow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon functions as both setting and metaphor effectively, constraining choices through its specific properties (reflecting no stars, only memory). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("moonlight lacquered the sand," "black as cut glass"). However, the zeppelin interior remains generic beyond "shelves of fluttering manuscripts."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from cataloging documents to personal retrocognitive seizures to direct temporal communication. The cost is visible in Mara's physical and emotional experience. The tension between "archiving remotely" versus personal investigation creates genuine pressure that narrows options toward the beach encounter.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central question "Why did you trust a future you would never see?" and its answer about stories traveling when bodies cannot. The obsidian lagoon as memory pool and the transformation of documentation into revolt work without explicit moralizing. The final image powerfully reweights the entire narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through archival language ("traced faded signatures," "guardian of future records"). The temporal figure's "rippling syllables" effectively distinguish voices. Some register drift occurs with phrases like "retrocognitive snare" that feel overly technical for the lyrical mode established.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in the beach sequence. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "melted corridors" mixed with "muddy protest streets" creates metaphor confusion; "word-kayak across the ages" strains credibility. Template phrasing in "Mara knelt...Mara realized...Mara remembered" reduces momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of retrocognitive seizures triggered by an encrypted diary offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of civil rights archiving with temporal communication transforms familiar ghost-story elements. The specific detail of "Freedom Cartographers" and beach debris as activist code shows originality beyond surface novelty.</comment>
