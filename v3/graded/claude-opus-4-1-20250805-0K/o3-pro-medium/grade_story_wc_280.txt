<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's synesthetic perception creates a distinct interiority, and their choice to help Lazzaro shows clear motivation rooted in empathy for incompleteness. However, the transformation feels slightly unearned—the janitor accepts time-manipulation too readily without sufficient internal resistance or cost calculation at the pivotal moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Lazzaro's restoration and the narrator's choice to be late, with visible cost in abandoning routine. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the time-braiding climax. Minor orientation lag (the mall-to-theater transition) and some causality softness around the time-manipulation mechanics prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synesthetic sensory palette ("colors sing C-sharp in my nostrils") and the mystic orchard setting effectively constrain and enable the protagonist's choices. The hedge maze literally seals behind them, forcing commitment. The indigo apples and velvet curtains materialize with specificity that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through sensory accumulation toward the time-braiding moment, with the protagonist actively choosing to throw the "rope of sound." The cost—abandoning punctual routine for possibility—lands but feels slightly lightweight given the story's metaphysical stakes. The conflict resolves through the protagonist's agency, though the mechanics of "breathing echoes" remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of incomplete performances and second chances emerges organically through Lazzaro's trapped loop and the narrator's intervention. The final line "Some debts, after all, are settled only when possibility hears its own name" resonates without moralizing. The nostalgia motif effectively reweights from "winters I have yet to live" to "remembered applause."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synesthetic voice creates a distinct perceptual signature with consistent internal logic ("colors whispered into my ears," "voice ringing visible in concentric silver ripples"). Lazzaro's theatrical dialogue appropriately contrasts the narrator's contemplative register. Minor strain appears in elevated moments like "facet-cut time" that slightly exceed the janitor-narrator's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong sensory density and varied syntax create momentum, particularly in the time-braiding sequence. However, some figurative density approaches overwriting ("nostalgia rises like chimney smoke from winters I have yet to live") and occasional register elevation ("facet-cut," "harmonized by shared relief") creates minor friction with the established voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synesthetic time-repair concept offers genuine freshness, combining sensory crossing with temporal manipulation in an unexpected synthesis. The specific detail of a janitor as witness/healer and the "encore-seeking ghost" trapped in a death-loop avoids generic ghost story templates. Risk-taking in the experimental sensory language heightens rather than obscures meaning.</comment>
