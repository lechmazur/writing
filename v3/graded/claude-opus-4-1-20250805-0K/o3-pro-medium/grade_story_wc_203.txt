I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor assessing its publishability in elite literary venues.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marlen's motivation to "discover what ceilings hide" drives consistent choices throughout, from accepting the midnight call to crawling through the hidden passage. His ability to see ghosts creates authentic internal tension without therapy-speak. The final choice to donate the mainspring shows earned character evolution with visible cost (giving up a valuable find).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through ghostly appearances, dust patterns, and the mainspring discovery. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Marlen removes the timepiece, releasing both ghosts and building from their "weightless burden." The cost is legible in "Behind him, the ticket office stood silent, mainspring gone, ghosts at rest" - the supernatural companionship he valued is now lost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus setting constrains choices effectively - the hidden crawl space above the elevator enables discovery, while dust patterns become investigative tools. "Cracks in the facade deeper than mortar" establishes both physical and metaphorical decay. The mainspring on the velvet clown hat creates specific, irreplaceable imagery that charges the final resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine service call to supernatural encounter to historical mystery, with Marlen's investigation driving each deepening. The mainspring discovery forces a choice between keeping the valuable artifact or releasing the ghosts. Cost is visible when "ghosts lined the passage, bowing with gratitude" - he loses his spectral companions by solving their imprisonment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of hidden mechanisms keeping time after their purpose expires. The "weightless burden" paradox gains meaning through both ghosts and Marlen carrying invisible obligations. The ending's "repaired elevator rising and falling like slow applause" offers resonant closure without stating a moral about letting go.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("crouched like a rusted spider") and controlled rhythm that modulates with discovery tension. POV remains stable with Marlen's selective perception of mechanical and spectral details. Some register elevation ("arterial pathway for carnival cash") slightly exceeds a repair technician's likely lexicon but serves the ghostly atmosphere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery like "ghosts materialized, their carnival costumes faded to opalescent grays." Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor redundancy in "weightless burden" appearing twice weakens impact. Some syntactic similarity in discovery sequence ("He understood... But years passed...") creates slight monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of elevator technician protagonist with ghost-seeing ability creates non-obvious angle on haunted location trope. The horologist's mainspring as perpetual profit-counter transforms a mechanical object into emotional anchor. Risk-taking in the lyrical style and supernatural acceptance heightens meaning without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
