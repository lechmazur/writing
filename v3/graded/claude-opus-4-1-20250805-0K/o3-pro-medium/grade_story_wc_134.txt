I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages as Arden's quest leads to the cave, the pearl's discovery triggers transformations, and Mara's realization about Arden shifts the resolution.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong character particularity with Arden's "compass of small marvels" and Mara's ironic blindness to her own prophecy. The final choice to leave the pearl shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstraction in emotional states ("wonder thrives by being shared") rather than fully embodied revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear causal progression with Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Arden's decision to leave the pearl reconfigures the quest's meaning with visible cost. The twist that Mara's prophecy referred to Arden, not the pearl, lands cleanly. Slight deduction for mild orientation delay in the opening third regarding their relationship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The musical crystal cave functions as active setting that constrains choices and enables the climax through its responsive crystals and multiplying reflections. Vivid sensory work: "crystals chiming an undercurrent that rearranged itself." The pool and pearl become instrumental to closure, not mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual quest to metaphysical confrontation with doubled selves, forcing Arden's renunciation. The cost is visible when he sets the pearl down "for the next wanderer." Minor deduction for the shadow-doubles resolution feeling slightly abrupt after strong buildup.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pearl/sharing paradox and Mara's realization about witnessing versus possessing miracles. The ending reweights the entire quest without stating a moral. Strong resonance in "wonder thrives by being shared, not owned."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("Low sunbeams poured like molten brass") and consistent perceptual signature. Clean POV control throughout. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("aborted chords") that slightly exceeds the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Deductions for scattered overwriting ("steadily unpredictable" appears twice; "overlapping shadows" repeats) and occasional purple moments ("whispers of aborted chords"). Information density is high but some metaphors strain.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of quest narrative with meta-commentary on prophecy and ownership of wonder. The "clairvoyant who didn't see it coming" offers genuine irony. Some familiar elements (crystal cave, magical pearl) limit higher scoring despite strong execution.</comment>
