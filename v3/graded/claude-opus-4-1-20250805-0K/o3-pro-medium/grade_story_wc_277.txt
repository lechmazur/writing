I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story operates through clear because/therefore linkages (phone call → curiosity → meeting → revelation → decision → action).

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amelia's motivation is clear and rooted in family legacy versus moral duty, with embodied details like gripping the pen nib "like a sailor clutches sextant." The internal conflict between loyalty to ancestors and ethical obligation drives a credible transformation, though some passages lean toward diagnostic clarity ("fear orbited her resolve") rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong causal chain from dormant phone to activated presses, with clear closure showing Amelia's decision to print the floodgate truth as a Decisive Change with visible cost (selling estate for reparations). The orrery scene effectively reweights the inheritance metaphor, though the "proof by contradiction" logic feels slightly mechanical.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting constrains and enables the confrontation effectively, with the orrery serving as both physical object and thematic device. Sensory details like "Lightning illuminated the gondola interior like flashbulbs" integrate well, though some descriptions tend toward the ornamental ("planets revolving in choreographed orbits of regret").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from curiosity to moral reckoning, with the floodgate revelation forcing a choice between family loyalty and justice. The cost is concrete (estate sale, reputation risk), and Amelia's agency drives the resolution through her declaration and the physical act of scratching the orrery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the orrery's headline-planets and the central question of inherited guilt versus personal responsibility. The ending's image of "telephones...startling dust into dances of accountability" resonates without moralizing, though Felix's "proof by contradiction" speech edges toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive perceptual signature ("catalogued sensations the way editors catalogued typos"). Dialogue carries appropriate formality and subtext, though Felix's explanatory mode occasionally feels authorial rather than character-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful figurative language, though density occasionally tips toward overwriting ("planets revolving in choreographed orbits of regret"). Some passages exhibit mild template cadence ("She asked...Felix answered...He explained") that dulls momentum in the middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The orrery as news-archive is inventive, transforming the inheritance metaphor into physical space. The "proof by contradiction" logic offers a fresh angle on whistleblower narratives, though execution occasionally defaults to expected beats within the confrontation-revelation structure.</comment>
