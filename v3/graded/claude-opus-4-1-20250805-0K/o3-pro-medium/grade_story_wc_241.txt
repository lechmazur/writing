<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Celeste's contradictory impulses—seeking pattern in chaos while knowing its futility—manifest concretely through her notebook methodology and the final heel-crushing of glass. The father's gambling compulsion and her statistical rigor create genuine tension that drives her subway quest. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("clover melancholy," "theoretically rebellious") that occasionally replaces embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as Celeste gathers city scrawls that culminate in the lantern discovery and glass-breaking moment—a Resonant Reconfiguration where "uncertainty...sat beside her like a quiet friend." Cost is visible in the shards she gathers and the question she'll carry to the hospital. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (library location unclear until line 26) and some causality softness around how the lantern appears.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rainwashed library, subway graffiti, and wet city streets create atmospheric pressure that mirrors Celeste's search for meaning. The lantern's mica pane constrains the final choice beautifully. However, some settings remain generic (hospital, subway car interiors lack specific texture beyond functional description).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes center on Celeste's need to "forgive chaos" after her father's heart attack, with the subway data-gathering intensifying toward the lantern discovery. The glass-breaking creates visible cost and forecloses her pattern-seeking path. Missing stronger mid-story tightening—the subway observations accumulate without significantly narrowing options until the library arrival.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the lantern metaphor—"Perspective widens only where glass yields"—without heavy-handed moralizing. The final realization that "contradictions stay lucid, neither rationalized nor denied" resonates through accumulated particulars. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract "bloom and loss" phrasing that edges toward thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in how Celeste reads the city as "murmuring dataset" and sees "dice pips in the flicker." The prose rhythm accelerates during subway observations and slows for the library revelation effectively. Minor filter verb clustering ("She believed," "She wondered," "she knew") slightly dulls immediacy in places.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information-dense prose with lines doing multiple jobs ("turning pages the way a card shark flips decks"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("afternoon light dripped like diluted jade") and abstract constructions ("clover melancholy which hovers"). Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of reading city graffiti as probability data offers a fresh angle on grief processing. The lantern's dual appearance—memory object becoming literal artifact—creates non-obvious synthesis. However, the gambling daughter/professor tension is somewhat familiar territory, preventing higher scoring.</comment>
