I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through layered imagery and pattern rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper's oath creates genuine tension between witnessing and intervention, embodied in concrete choices (laying down journals, choosing to drift rather than warn). The character's "loosely gripping reality" manifests through the origami's reality-bending properties and mirror reflections, though some interiority relies on abstract declarations ("neutrality became effortless") rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator accepts their witnessing role while acknowledging its cost ("learning to stand on shards"). The origami swan's transformation from map to boat creates coherent accumulative pressure. Minor orientation delay (who/where unclear until line 5) but pays off through the disorienting catacomb setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The obsidian refuge functions as transformative setting—its "regenerative silence" actively changes the narrator by drinking their words and stitching reality. Environment consistently constrains choice (glass walls yielding, river rising, corridors unfolding with the swan). Sensory hierarchy reflects the narrator's archival perspective ("dust choked torchlight," "pages crisp with mildew").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Central tension between witnessing and intervention escalates through rising floodwater forcing a choice. The obsidian refuge sequence deepens stakes by showing the cost of neutrality ("watching the water gnaw the bank"). Agency manifests through renunciation—choosing to witness rather than warn—with visible cost in the "failing sky."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "regenerative silence" that births "calmer echoes" from digested pain. The final image of continuing "beneath a failing sky" offers a non-literal answer about bearing witness amid collapse. The swan's transformation from map to boat embodies adaptation without intervention, though some passages edge toward explicit thesis ("that is the price of peace").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive perceptual signature filters everything through archival metaphors ("chronicle keeper," "pages," "atlas of my mind"). Voice modulates effectively from contemplative opening to urgent river escape. The experimental compression ("Seasons lost their names") and patterned repetition of witnessing language serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("walls of glass parted like curtains surrendering a stage"). Some overwriting in metaphor density ("startled pigeons," "molting serpent," "caged heart" clustered too tightly). Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("Some replicas wept, some laughed, some carried") but serves intentional mirror-effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archive-keeper confronting physical dissolution transforms the witness-narrator trope through concrete magical realism (origami that reshapes corridors). The obsidian refuge as memory-digesting entity offers genuine originality. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and reality-slippage pays off, though some metaphors lean familiar ("failing sky").</comment>
