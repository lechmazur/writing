<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhaun's guilt-driven journey from celebrated tutor to exile achieves strong characterization through concrete embodied details like "fidgets productively" and his methodical decoding of the tapestry. The internal contradiction between his need for forgiveness and his persistent chess-mind creates genuine complexity. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of his self-forgiveness moment lacking more visceral embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with escalating symbolic work through tapestry, labyrinth, and final forgiveness achieving Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost is visible in "embraced the single path he actually walked" and the prince's ghost's approval. Strong causality from guilt through puzzle-solving to village revival, though the mechanism linking Rhaun's forgiveness to the village's awakening could be more explicit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen village with "clock faces frozen in mid-chime" and "platinum labyrinth" creates vivid, purposeful setting that directly constrains Rhaun's choices. The mirrored hedges reflecting "guilt back at him in a thousand warped shards" excellently integrates environment with internal state. Slight deduction for some abstract descriptions like "woven hush" that could be more sensory-specific.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal guilt through village restoration with clear deepening as Rhaun realizes "the last piece missing was neither tapestry nor maze but the self he had entombed in remorse." The cost manifests in his acceptance of the irreversible past. However, the village's stake feels somewhat disconnected from Rhaun's personal journey until late.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic emergence through the chess metaphor extending to life choices, with the tapestry's crimson/silver beads mapping fatal versus prudent moves. The ending achieves resonance without stating a moral through "determined never to teach brilliance without mercy." The prince's ghost making "its final move" provides excellent non-literal closure to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive chess-inflected perception ("cataloguing streets as if they were chess files"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains against the character's voice ("fierce repose," "winnow truth from regret"). The narrative maintains good psychic distance but lacks distinctive rhythmic modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. However, several instances of elevated register drift ("winnow truth from regret," "fierce repose") and some abstract phrasing ("woven hush," "braided, taut") that could be more concrete. The "fidgets productively" construction feels forced. Information density is good but inconsistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess mastery, time-frozen village, and guilt/forgiveness creates an original angle on redemption narrative. The platinum labyrinth reflecting multiple possible selves is particularly inventive. The specific detail of using chess-flag repair tools for the tapestry shows strong particularity. Slight deduction for somewhat familiar exile-seeks-redemption arc.</comment>
