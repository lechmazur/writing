<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysandra's motivation to capture beauty before oblivion drives concrete micro-choices through the emerald infusion ritual, with embodied tension between precision and the hovering threat of failure. The character's professional specificity and ritualistic patience create believable expertise, though the admiral remains more vessel than pressure-source.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the admiral's preserved vigilance and Lysandra's return to waiting crystallize with visible cost—the emerald's willing imprisonment and her promise to the void. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details (aurora, static, emerald light) build toward the final charged state where death itself seems to acknowledge victory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dirigible monastery and aurora-lit grotto create immediate atmospheric pressure, with the emerald's properties and radio static serving as functional constraints that shape Lysandra's method. Setting details like "bone-lined vaults" and "curtains of light folded like lungs" actively participate in the ritual's success.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Lysandra navigates the "threshold of stillness," with stakes tightening when she must balance between fracturing the spark and alerting oblivion. The cost manifests in the emerald's dimming sacrifice and her bargain with the void, though conflict remains primarily internal/atmospheric.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central question of beauty outliving breath, answered not through declaration but through the admiral's transformed state—"ready to issue orders to any star brave enough to pass." The final aurora rearrangement acknowledges a victory "too small for history, yet infinite to the heart it saved," avoiding moral summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout—Lysandra experiences the world through beautician-mortician precision ("patience of a glacier," "3.7 megacycles"). Voice maintains lyric control under pressure with purposeful compression and taught patterns like the radio-tuning sequence paying off in the emerald infusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The gem dimmed, its fire willingly imprisoned" conveys action, cost, and personification simultaneously. Some elevated diction ("radiant hush," "lattice") fits the ceremonial context, though occasional abstract phrases like "threshold of stillness inside herself" could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The beautician-mortician premise offers genuine freshness, combining professional specificity with metaphysical resonance through the radio-frequency soul-catching method. The risk of lyric accumulation over traditional plot pays off through the emerald-infusion ritual's precise, original mechanics. +0.3 for unconventional structural choices that heighten meaning.</comment>
