I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly for publishability in elite venues.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Hybrid (Causal dominant with Accumulative elements). The story follows causal linkage (organ music → spatial transformation → key retrieval) while accumulating atmospheric pressure through the narrowing passages and mounting claustrophobia.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aveline's claustrophobia creates genuine internal conflict against her mission need, with embodied panic ("scratching at her lungs," "trembling palm"). The contradiction between her prudent nature and necessary risk-taking drives credible choices. Minor deduction for some abstract emotional labeling ("wistful yet determined") rather than fully embodied states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear causal chain from organ activation through spatial transformation to key retrieval, with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Aveline accepts the burden of guarding the key's use. Cost is visible in her understanding that "doors invited war as easily as relief." Deduction for slightly convenient world-logic where architecture responds to negotiation without sufficient grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shifting architecture functions as dynamic setting that constrains choices—passages narrow, walls pulse with chords, the dome opens to stars. The drafting compass point inherited from her mother adds specificity. Strong sensory work with "night air tasted of iron" and "stale incense." Setting actively shapes the protagonist's tactics through spatial negotiation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Central stake (retrieving the key to prevent starvation) drives consistent pressure through architectural obstacles. The spatial mutiny creates escalating challenges requiring negotiation rather than force. However, the resolution feels slightly too neat—the architecture's compliance with geometric diplomacy lacks sufficient cost or trade-off to fully earn the high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of negotiation versus conquest emerges organically through Aveline's interaction with rebellious space. The final understanding that "doors invited war as easily as relief" reweights the entire quest. Strong subtext in the hidden maps "builders dared not ink on parchment." Minor deduction for slightly overt thematic statement about "spatial mutiny" respecting negotiation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with controlled metaphor ("stone throat," "spider-silken pipes") and consistent POV. Strong perceptual signature in how Aveline notices architectural details and measures spaces. The prose modulates effectively with pressure, tightening during claustrophobic moments. Minor repetition in some descriptive patterns ("mournful arches," "shadowed nexus").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some overwrought phrases ("star-choked sky," "centuries of cold duty") and occasional register elevation beyond the POV's natural voice. Template cadence appears briefly in the middle section with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of exploration narrative with sentient architecture that must be negotiated rather than conquered. The specific use of a drafting compass as diplomatic tool shows originality. The concept of spatial mutiny responding to music transforms familiar church-organ imagery. Risk-taking in the abstract architectural descriptions heightens stakes while maintaining clarity.</comment>
