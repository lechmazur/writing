I'll evaluate this story under a **Hybrid lens** (primarily Accumulative/Textural with Causal elements at closure), as the piece builds through layered imagery and ritual repetition before resolving into a causal breakthrough.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Griffin's pacifist conviction and gravitational buoyancy create a distinctive character physics, with internal shadow work dramatized through concrete ritual. The final choice to share liberation rather than hoard it demonstrates earned values under pressure. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing around "shadow work" that occasionally drifts toward therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly—the frost gate opening into an impossible corridor crystallizes Griffin's shadow work success with visible transformation of space itself. Cost is legible in "forgives himself for surviving" and the dissolution of soldier-ghosts. The hybrid lens holds as accumulative ritual triggers causal breakthrough.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship setting constrains and enables—its patchwork hull mirrors Griffin's internal stitching, while the airlock becomes the literal threshold for transformation. Sensory details like "scent of rain on soil untouched by boots or bombs" charge the dimensional shift. Some early description tends toward the abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: ventilation hum→temple bells→frost gate formation→dimensional opening. Griffin's increasing buoyancy tracks emotional state physically. The final gesture of inclusion over solitary escape demonstrates agency with clear cost—sharing dilutes individual power.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the integration of violence and peace—Griffin absorbing historical soldiers' violence to neutralize it. The ending reweights survival guilt as necessary preparation for collective liberation. The tear-as-key metaphor occasionally veers toward the explicit but recovers through embodied ritual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with phrases like "bones whispering like flutes carved from dandelion stems" creates a lyrical-spiritual register. Some moments drift into elevated diction that strains against the intimate POV ("jury-rigged like a quilt to carry the remnants of memory"). Perceptual signature remains consistent—Griffin experiences emotion as physical weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong figurative language mostly lands ("griffin floated...like an errant feather," "grief to drown a star") but occasionally overreaches. Some abstract scaffolding around "shadow work" and "the Action, capital A" could be more concrete. Information density is high, with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The conceit of gravitational response to emotion offers fresh physics for internal state. Shadow work as literal stitching of light and dark, performed through photographs of warriors, transforms a therapeutic concept into concrete ritual. The recycled warship setting adds specificity to post-extinction scenarios.</comment>
