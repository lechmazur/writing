<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cressida's choice to scatter the colors rather than bottle presence shows earned renunciation with visible cost. The contradictory impulses between mastery and surrender act simultaneously in scene, particularly when she sees both healing and weaponization paths. However, Roan remains somewhat functional rather than applying genuine pressure, and the internal conflict resolves too smoothly without sufficient struggle at the decisive moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration - Cressida's renunciation of mastery reweights "returning differently" from failure to wisdom. The cost is legible when she scatters the unresolved colors, choosing uncertainty over control. The orientation anchors (alchemist, ember nexus, twilight) establish clearly by line 3, and the shell's properties constrain choices throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ember nexus functions as active setting - its "curling acoustics" make the paradox feel "precise," while basalt slabs provide staging and slagglass pools reflect character states. The nautilus shell operates as micro-setting, its temperature dips and spiral equations constraining experimentation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "tasting salt and star-dust" links discovery to embodied perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake - capturing "density of presence" - evolves from technical challenge to ethical choice when Cressida sees the dual paths of healing/weaponization. The tightening occurs when colors shatter under "old arithmetic," forcing the revaluation. However, the resolution comes too easily; Cressida's renunciation lacks sufficient internal resistance, and Roan's burn feels convenient rather than consequential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of "returning differently" - progress through apparent retreat. The shell drinking Roan's pain and returning "warmth elsewise" embodies this revaluation concretely. The final image of walking "sideways" rather than forward resonates without stating a moral, and "every detour would tint their palette of resolve a shade truer" avoids tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevation with purposeful compression ("ember nexus," "pocket-sun threads") that suits the alchemical frame. Perceptual signature shows in selective details like "fractured arch where heat shimmered" and space that "thickens as if listening." However, dialogue between Cressida and Roan lacks distinction - both speak in similar registers despite their different roles.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "vials that glowed like held sunsets, eager to be uncorked" combines description, metaphor, and personification efficiently. Rhythm varies naturally from short declarations ("The words were simple") to complex accumulations. Minor weakness in occasional abstraction ("density of presence") that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy with emotional philosophy feels fresh - bottling not light but "the weight of now." The reversal where returning means "not arriving at all" transforms the quest narrative unexpectedly. "Pocket-sun alchemist" and "scientifically romantic collaborator" create specific character types beyond archetypes, and the shell that "drank pain, returning warmth elsewise" offers genuine conceptual originality.</comment>
