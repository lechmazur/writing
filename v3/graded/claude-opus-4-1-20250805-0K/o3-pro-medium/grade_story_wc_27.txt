<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maris's barefoot vulnerability and awkward confidence create consistent embodied tension, particularly in her descent to the stone circle where "heartbeat echoed like distant artillery." The shift from searching for wreckage to carrying "music, not weapons" earns its resonance through concrete sensory details and micro-choices, though the final soldier interaction feels slightly underdeveloped for full cost visibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through sensory layers (crickets, oil, humming stones) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Maris's vision transforms from debris to constellation patterns. The closure lands with felt cost as she chooses vulnerability ("accidentally laughing") over safety, though the exact stakes of her "impossible plan" could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport and underground stone circle create vivid constraints—"oily dust," "stalactites of frozen lubricant," "ink-black pillars"—that shape Maris's barefoot navigation and discovery. The opera glasses' transformation of the cavern walls into constellation maps directly enables her final choice, earning the setting's causal weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from surface searching to descent, from individual hum to "choir buried alive," culminating in the satellite's answering thruster-flick. The cost manifests in Maris's exposed position ("soldier barked a question") and her commitment to an "impossible plan" that risks the fragile truce.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The theme of finding "meaning in the mess" emerges through concrete particulars—opera glasses amid wreckage, ancient stones beneath war machinery—without explicit moralizing. The final image of "discovering constellations within" the mess resonantly reweights the opening search, though the vision of "metal beating into plows" edges toward familiar territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Maris's perceptual signature—noticing "crickets whispered," feeling objects "throb," experiencing the hum "sluicing through bones"—creates distinct sensory authority. The prose modulates effectively from contemplative opening to visceral descent, though occasional elevated diction ("condemned angels," "prehistoric night") slightly strains the barefoot stargazer's lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Thunder rolled somewhere topside, maybe a collapsing girder, maybe the sky itself remembering its voice"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("condemned angels," "petrified snakes," "captive nebulae") and occasional register elevation, but propulsion remains clear through varied syntax and purposeful repetition of "hum."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of opera glasses with stone circles—high culture meeting ancient technology in a war-torn spaceport—creates unexpected resonance. The "barefoot stargazer" navigating by touch and sound offers a fresh sensory angle on post-conflict discovery, though the seeds-not-fire satellite vision feels somewhat expected.</comment>
