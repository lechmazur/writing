<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marlo's motivation to negotiate with his ghost and reclaim lost ambitions is clear and drives consistent choices throughout. The internal conflict between regret and forward movement manifests concretely through his scavenging actions and the physical surrender of stolen story fragments. The final choice to carry stories rather than steal them represents earned transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with surreal logic that coheres internally. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Marlo fills the ghost's cavity with stolen fragments, transforming from thief to carrier of stories—a clear before/after with felt cost. The kinetic lagoon's time-distorting mechanics and the camera wheel's role are established early and pay off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon above clouds with its revolving lily pads and carousel horse pier creates a distinctive surreal environment that actively constrains choices through memory-erasing rotations. Sensory details like "mist slaps into sky" and "shadows gallop beneath boards" are selective and purposeful. The setting's time-distortion mechanics directly shape Marlo's navigation and final negotiation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—negotiating with one's ghost for direction—is signaled early and tightens through accumulating pressure as Marlo crosses memory-erasing lily pads and confronts his hollow double. The cost manifests visibly when he must surrender his stolen story fragments to fill the ghost's cavity. Agency drives the resolution through Marlo's choice to release the sounds rather than hoard them.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of transformation from taking to carrying emerges organically through Marlo's journey from "resolute scavenger" who steals stories to one who must learn to carry them responsibly. The final image of the ghost "no longer hollow" and Marlo launched toward dawn resonates without stating a moral. The recurring motif of fragments/stories accumulates meaning and directly shapes the closure choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyrical register with distinctive constructions like "chronologically confused but painfully aware" and "regret is a currency accepted by ghosts." POV remains stable in third-limited with controlled psychic distance. The prose texture supports the surreal atmosphere while remaining comprehensible, though some elevated diction occasionally strains.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful compression. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "Legend says a person can bargain for direction if they confront the echo of what they could have been." Some elevated register moments ("kinetic lagoon," "fractured stillness") occasionally feel forced but don't obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of negotiating with one's ghost through surrendering stolen story fragments offers a fresh angle on redemption narratives. The surreal world-building with time-distorting lagoons and carousel horse piers creates memorable specificity. The transformation from scavenger to story-carrier feels earned and non-obvious, avoiding typical ghost story resolutions.</comment>
