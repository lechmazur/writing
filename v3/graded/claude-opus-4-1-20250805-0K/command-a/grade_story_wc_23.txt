I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal - the story follows clear because/therefore linkages from the broken hydraulics through cryptic calls to building the beacon and attracting travelers.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear but remains largely external and functional. The "geography of loss" metaphor lacks embodied emotional specificity, and her internal experience reads as stated rather than felt. The arrival of travelers provides external validation but no genuine internal contradiction or cost to her choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story achieves basic causal coherence with the beacon-building leading to travelers arriving, but the closure lacks visible cost - Mara gains community without sacrificing anything meaningful. The "geography of loss" and "reverse migration" concepts remain abstract metaphors rather than dramatized stakes. The Resonant Reconfiguration attempt (station becoming refuge) occurs without the required felt price or trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The signal station setting provides functional constraints through the broken hydraulics and cliff-edge isolation. The censer foot's moon-phase glow creates a workable temporal rhythm. However, sensory detail remains predominantly visual, and the station's transformation from prison to refuge could use more tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract despite the "reverse migration" framing - we never see what concrete loss Mara or the travelers face. The beacon-building provides activity but minimal tension since success comes without meaningful obstacles. The cryptic calls create mild pressure but resolve too easily into straightforward instructions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The navigation/loss metaphor and patchwork/weaving imagery provide surface coherence but lack depth. "Raw solace" appears twice as a label without embodied demonstration. The ending's community-building resolution feels thematically convenient rather than earned through specific struggle - the complexity of loss gets simplified into connection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains basic consistency, though Mara's perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness beyond functional observation. Prose rhythms remain steady without modulation for emotional intensity. The narrative voice tends toward explanatory distance ("she felt a sense of purpose") rather than immediate experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "sanctuary and her prison" / "isolation...solitary"; "grueling...raw from hours of labor." Template cadence appears in "She had found...She believed...She began to suspect." The "patchwork" metaphor gets overworked without earning its centrality. Information density is moderate but could be tightened.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The reverse migration concept offers potential but executes as generic displacement without specific cultural or geographical grounding. The cryptic midnight calls and moon-phase artifact feel like assembled genre elements rather than organic story logic. The resolution into simple community-building lacks the promised complexity of navigating loss.</comment>
