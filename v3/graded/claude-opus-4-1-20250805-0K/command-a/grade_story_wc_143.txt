Looking at this story through a **Causal lens** - the narrative follows clear because/therefore linkages from Elara's mission to document, through discovering her mentor's message, to her decision to complete the documentation despite pressure to leave.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driven by professional duty deepening into personal memorial. The mentor relationship provides earned emotional weight. However, internal conflict remains somewhat surface-level - she feels urgency but never truly wrestles with leaving versus staying, reducing complexity at the crucial choice point.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Earned Stasis - Elara completes documentation despite pressure, with emotional cost visible in "heavy heart" and the preservation/loss tension. Causal chain holds: mission → discovery → determination → completion. Deduction for cost being somewhat told rather than viscerally felt in the final beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lunar environment actively constrains choices through harsh conditions, limited time, and the ticking clock of terraforming arrival. Setting details like "regolith," the module's "dulled metallic surface," and dawn's approach create genuine pressure. The summit location and its "eerie stillness" enhance atmosphere while driving urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional duty to personal memorial to defying mission control, with time pressure mounting. However, the tightening lacks genuine trade-offs - Elara never faces a real cost for staying longer. The "outlast the dawn" directive creates urgency but resolution comes without meaningful sacrifice beyond emotional weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus progress emerges organically through the concrete situation. The sand grain memento and mentor's message create resonance without explicit moralizing. Final image of "stories etched into lunar soil" effectively reweights earlier material, though the mentor's "smile" edges toward sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent technical precision appropriate to Elara's role, with selective perception focused on mission details. Phrases like "dawning hush" and "dawnlit melancholy" create atmospheric texture. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("universe whispered secrets") that doesn't fully align with the practical POV established elsewhere.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong sensory detail and varied sentence structure. Information density is good - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deductions for redundancy ("documenting every detail...meticulously documented"), some filter verb clustering ("caught her eye," "formed in her throat"), and the somewhat purple "universe whispered secrets."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The lunar preservation angle provides a fresh frame for familiar space exploration themes. The timed chemical message is inventive. However, the emotional arc follows predictable beats (discovery of mentor's message → renewed determination), and the resolution doesn't transform or subvert expectations in meaningful ways.</comment>
