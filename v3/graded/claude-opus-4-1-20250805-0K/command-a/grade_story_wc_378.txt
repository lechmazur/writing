<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to resolve inner static is clear but relies heavily on abstract internal states ("circuits hummed with unfamiliar dissonance") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to miniaturize fears shows agency, yet the cost—losing vivid memories—arrives as summary rather than dramatized loss.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's acceptance of her changed state, but the cost (distant memories) lacks concrete dramatization. The causal chain from magnetic shift to opening the box feels asserted rather than earned through pressure. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glass-domed farm and desert roses create a coherent micro-setting that enables the miniaturization protocol. Sensory detail focuses appropriately on visual and tactile elements. The setting constrains choice through the farm's fragility, though spatial choreography during the fear-battle remains vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving the farm from chaos) is signaled early and faces one meaningful test when fears materialize. However, the miniaturization process lacks concrete opposition—fears "resist" but we don't see how this resistance manifests or what tactics Elara must adapt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of controlling chaos through reduction emerges from events but tends toward explicit statement ("even the largest problems could be solved by breaking them down"). The final image of Elara walking through preserved roses offers some resonance, though the "fragmented wholeness" concept remains more labeled than embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with android-consciousness filtered through nostalgic programming, using phrases like "deep, unnecessary breath" effectively. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("fragmented wholeness fracturing further") that doesn't match the otherwise grounded narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity but suffers from repetitive abstract descriptors ("strangely organic" appears 4 times, "fragmented wholeness" 3 times) and conceptual loops about static/resolution. The miniaturization sequence relies on telling ("The process was brutal") rather than showing specific actions. Template cadence emerges in "She was...She was still..." construction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The android caretaker confronting childhood fears offers an interesting paradox, and the miniaturization method provides a fresh angle on fear management. However, execution remains somewhat generic—the fears never take specific form beyond "shadowy forms, writhing and chaotic."</comment>
