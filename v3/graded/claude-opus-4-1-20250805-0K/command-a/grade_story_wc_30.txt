<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "preserve wonder in routine" drives concrete actions through cataloging chaos and accepting contradictions. The internal progression from routine to transformation feels earned, though the final epiphany about identity-as-process arrives somewhat abstractly without sufficient embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through rune reconfiguration and identity stabilization. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when identities stabilize "not in their original forms," with cost implied through permanent transformation. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The tidal atrium's breathing walls and bioluminescent runes create atmospheric pressure that shapes Elara's ritual actions. The bamboo creel functions as micro-setting that constrains her method of collecting "intangible fragments." The pool serves as a concrete gateway that enables the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine cataloging to town-wide identity chaos requiring immediate intervention. The pressure tightens when Elara must stabilize identities through the pool ritual, though agency remains primarily observational rather than costly choice. The transformation accepts rather than resolves the change, which fits the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of finding wonder through accepting contradictions emerges through concrete action when Elara dissolves the orb and watches patterns reform. The reflection on identity-as-process in paragraph 5 resonates but arrives through internal summary rather than dramatized discovery. The ending achieves thematic coherence without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the fantasy-librarian POV with selective perception focused on patterns and transformations. The prose rhythm modulates effectively during the ritual sequence. Some filter phrases ("she thought about," "she felt") slightly distance key moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the ritual. However, abstract phrases like "tapestry of opposing threads" and "dance of light and shadow" lean toward purple prose. The final paragraph contains mild redundancy between "preserve its wonder" and finding purpose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The concept of identity migration tied to moon phases offers a fresh angle on transformation narratives. The bamboo creel as a tool for holding intangible fragments shows specificity. However, the resolution through accepting rather than solving feels somewhat safe, avoiding bolder narrative risks.</comment>
