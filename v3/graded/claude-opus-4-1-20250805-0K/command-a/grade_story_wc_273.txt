<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through her brother's death driving her search, with contradictory impulses of serene surface anger and deep burning rage acting simultaneously. The final choice to accept understanding over control is earned through the ink's revelation scene. However, the transformation feels slightly rushed, and the secondary character lacks dimension beyond wisdom-dispenser role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara shifts from seeking control to accepting understanding) with emotional cost visible in her tears and transformation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the story builds through imagery and pattern toward the ink's revelation. However, the cost could be more concrete—we see emotional release but limited practical consequence of choosing understanding over control.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment and desert setting are vivid early, with good sensory detail of "wind-sculpted sand" and eclipse lighting. However, the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain choices—Elara could have this revelation anywhere. The tent interior with diagrams provides atmosphere but doesn't shape the confrontation's outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding her brother's death through time manipulation) is signaled early and maintains coherence. The ink's revelation provides one meaningful deepening that changes Elara's knowledge and forecloses her path of seeking control. However, escalation is minimal—the confrontation lacks tangible opposition or cost beyond emotional acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the control/understanding dichotomy, with the ink serving as mirror rather than tool. The ending offers a non-literal answer about confronting rather than escaping the past. However, the woman's dialogue edges toward explicit theme statement ("It's about understanding it"), and the final paragraph's "power of understanding over control" veers into moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception filtered through Elara's tracker expertise and grief. The prose has distinct texture in phrases like "consciously wild intensity." Dialogue between Elara and the woman carries subtext and advances the revelation naturally, though the woman's wisdom-voice lacks individual character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and good momentum through most beats. However, the final paragraph contains scaffold phrases ("testament to the power of") and abstract summary that dulls the closure. Some filter verbs ("seemed to glow," "seemed to bend") dilute immediacy without clear voice motivation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The albino tracker with technological tools offers some freshness, and the disappearing ink as emotional mirror rather than time-control device provides a modest twist on the premise. However, the grief-driven quest and wise mentor revelation follow familiar patterns without significant transformation. The resolution's understanding-over-control message is competent but not distinctive.</comment>
