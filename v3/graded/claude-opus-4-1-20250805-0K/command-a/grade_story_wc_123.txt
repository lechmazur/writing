<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and his curiosity drives action, but interiority relies on telling ("credibly curious nature") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to act has some earned causality but lacks visceral cost—we're told about burden and promise without feeling the weight of what he's giving up.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage but the closure lacks decisive cost on the page—Elias finds "new purpose" but we don't see what he sacrifices or how his life actually changes. The quarantine revelation provides information but doesn't force a choice that forecloses options with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The courtyard and industrial wasteland are adequately anchored with selective detail ("damp earth," "rusted factories"), but setting functions mainly as backdrop rather than constraining choices. The tower laboratory could be any mysterious location without affecting the story's mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to larger threat, but the tightening lacks agency—Elias discovers information rather than making choices that narrow options. The "storms are not natural" revelation raises stakes abstractly without forcing a concrete trade-off or visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the integrity/solitude tension but resolves into explicit statement: "integrity demanded action." The final paragraph tells us about new purpose rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable with consistent focalization through Elias, and some perceptual signature emerges ("fingers brushed," "mind raced"). However, dialogue lacks subtext—the masked figure delivers exposition ("The storms… they're not natural") rather than pursuing goals through indirection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Prose is functional but relies on telling phrases ("credibly curious," "resolve hardening") and generic descriptors ("eerily empty," "lingering unease"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "sanctuary"/"refuge," "burden"/"promise" without added pressure. The final paragraph summarizes rather than crystallizing in image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The storm recorder investigating unnatural weather patterns offers a logical premise but follows familiar conspiracy-thriller beats without transformation. The mysterious message leading to secret compound discovery lacks specific inflection that would distinguish this from template plotting.</comment>
