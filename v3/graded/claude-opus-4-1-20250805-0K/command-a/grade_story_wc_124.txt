<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's grief-driven caution and eventual acceptance show clear motivation with embodied emotion (fingers brushing the vial, allowing tears). The transformation from avoidance to acceptance is earned through specific memory sequences. Internal conflict between fear and longing acts simultaneously throughout, though some moments lean toward emotional summary ("thick with sorrow").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure as Elias moves from fearful avoidance to acceptance of grief, with visible emotional cost in his tears. The vial's revelation sequence drives causal progression through memory scenes that reweight his understanding. Orientation anchors (lantern shop, city setting) establish early and the accumulative lens holds throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting details effectively constrain choice (the vial's ultraviolet glow, greenhouse's extinct blooms, jasmine/rain scent anchoring memory). The shop's "crystal shadows" and "flickering warmth" create coherent atmosphere. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's scent-avoidance through selective attention, though some descriptions edge toward the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confronting suppressed grief) signals early through "aromatically cautious choices." The vial creates meaningful escalation as Elias moves from hesitation to purchase to use, with each memory scene tightening emotional pressure. Final acceptance carries visible cost in tears, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: scents as "anchors to moments both beautiful and painful." The jasmine motif accumulates meaning from childhood to hospital to final acceptance. The ending offers resonant non-literal answer about memory's dual nature without moralizing, though Elias's realization edges toward articulated insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with controlled psychic distance, particularly effective in memory sequences. Perceptual signature clear in scent-focused attention and avoidance patterns. Some register elevation in emotional peaks ("fragile threads of his memories") doesn't quite match Elias's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts between present and memory scenes. Information density good in descriptive passages. Minor loops appear ("thick with sorrow"/"voice thick with sorrow," "crystal shadows" repeated) and some elevated diction in peak moments ("indescribably familiar") dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The perfume vial as memory-revealer offers fresh angle on grief exploration, avoiding typical flashback mechanics. Specific synthesis of scent-memory-grief feels earned through particular details. The extinct plant greenhouse adds originality, though the grief-to-acceptance arc follows familiar emotional territory.</comment>
