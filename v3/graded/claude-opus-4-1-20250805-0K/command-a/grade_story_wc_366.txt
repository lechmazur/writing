I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rigorous standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This story operates under a **Hybrid** lens, beginning with Accumulative/Textural elements (sea glass fascination, atmospheric lighthouse details) and shifting to Causal in the middle section (stones as code, hidden compartment mechanism). The ending returns to Accumulative with the resolution of "bottling safety" through accumulated symbolic actions.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's characterization succeeds through embodied habit (sea glass in pocket) and the contradiction between reticence and warm observation. The closure choice to "protect the light" feels earned through accumulated detail, though his acceptance of the mysterious mission lacks sufficient internal resistance for higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's transformation from passive keeper to active guardian, with visible cost in accepting unknown responsibility. However, the causal mechanics (stone code suddenly opening wall compartment) strain credibility, and the shift from textural to puzzle-solving mode creates lens ambiguity that weakens structural coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting effectively constrains action and provides tactile detail (oil, wicks, stone floor). The sea glass's luminescence and the lamp's flickering create atmospheric pressure that shapes Elias's choices, though the hidden compartment feels conveniently placed rather than organically discovered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from routine maintenance to mysterious threat through the lamp failure and cryptic messages. The pressure coheres around "protecting the light," though the actual threat remains too abstract—we never learn what specifically endangers the lighthouse or why Elias alone can protect it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of safety as active guardianship emerges through accumulated details and pays off in the final image of Elias as protector. The sea glass metaphor effectively links physical and emotional illumination, though the letter's philosophical statement ("To bottle the feeling of safety...") veers toward explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and captures Elias's quiet observation effectively ("warmly observant eyes missed nothing"). However, register drift appears in elevated moments ("luminescent ache," "quiet resolve") that clash with the established working-class maritime perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity but suffers from repetitive structures ("He knew... He turned... He sat...") and occasional overwriting ("luminescent ache that reminded him of something he couldn't quite name"). The final paragraph contains three instances of abstract telling ("quiet resolve," "bottle the feeling of safety") that dilute the closing impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-guardian metaphor offers a serviceable fresh angle on the keeper tradition. However, the mysterious message system and hidden compartment feel derivative of puzzle-box narratives, and the transformation lacks the specific lived detail that would elevate beyond competent genre execution.</comment>
