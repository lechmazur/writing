<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias has clear motivation and embodied emotion (the "screaming tenderness" that makes his chest ache), but the encounter with the mysterious woman lacks sufficient causal grounding for her appearance and disappearance. The internal shift from doubt to certainty happens too smoothly without genuine struggle or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's understanding that "intentions, when pure and quiet, had a power that shouts could never match," but the cost remains abstract rather than visceral. The mysterious woman's appearance and guidance lack causal linkage—she materializes without setup and vanishes without consequence beyond thematic validation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong sensory work with the jasmine/damp earth scent threading through as both literal and metaphorical guide. The lighthouse setting constrains movement and creates atmosphere, though it doesn't meaningfully pressure Elias's choices until he leaves it to follow the woman.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is declared early but faces no genuine opposition or test. The vial cork creates curiosity but no real pressure; the woman's appearance provides validation rather than challenge. Missing the friction that would make the resolution feel earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The central metaphor of whispers versus shouts emerges organically through the vial's vibrations and Elias's quiet nature, avoiding explicit moralizing until the woman states it directly. The theme would resonate more strongly if the insight were earned through concrete struggle rather than mystical confirmation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with appropriate psychic distance and clean free indirect style ("It was absurd, he knew"). The prose has distinct texture in moments like "vibrations of intent" and maintains coherent focalization throughout, though dialogue is minimal and the woman's voice lacks distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum, but several instances of abstract telling ("a stirring of hope, a sense that change was coming") and some redundancy in describing the vial's properties. The phrase "screaming tenderness" stands out as fresh, though some passages rely on generic descriptors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The concept of a humming vial cork containing "vibrations of intent" offers originality, but the resolution through a mystical guide who appears to validate the protagonist's beliefs follows a familiar template. The specific combination of lighthouse keeper and garden scents provides some freshness.</comment>
