<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" drives consistent choices through tending the garden and allowing Kai's presence, with concrete embodiment in her hand touching the pendant as shield. The vulnerability-protection dynamic creates genuine internal tension, though the resolution toward "beginning" feels slightly unearned given the brief interaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as moss patterns, icicle traces, and amber light build toward a resonant reconfiguration where "vulnerability, when protected, could bloom." Cost appears in Elara's exposed confession and careful trust, though the shift from "refuge" to "beginning" needs stronger causal grounding beyond shared notebooks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned data center as moss garden constrains choices—Elara must lead Kai through specific paths, point to icicle patterns, stop at the fern cluster. Sensory hierarchy reflects her watchful nature: "soft and emerald," "dappled patterns," "delicate latticework" all filter through her aesthetic lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake of protected vulnerability faces one meaningful test when Kai arrives knowing her confession, forcing Elara to choose between isolation and guided sharing. The notebook exchange deepens options but lacks sufficient pressure to fully transform the refuge-to-beginning shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "honeyed hush" concept elegantly bridges preservation instinct with shared language for healing, emerging through concrete details rather than declaration. The final image of sitting "side by side, the notebook open between them" offers resonant answer to vulnerability's potential, though "graft new meaning onto old wounds" arrives too explicitly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges in Elara's attention to patterns and preservation: "beauty in decay," "stories hidden in silence." Dialogue carries natural subtext—"I wanted to see where you found peace" pursues understanding without intrusion, while shared vocabulary ("watching") reveals alignment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose maintains strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "amber pendant, a gift from her grandmother, hung heavy around her neck" establishes object, backstory, and emotional weight simultaneously. Minor template cadence appears in "She was..." constructions but doesn't touch closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The data center as sanctuary for digital-age vulnerability offers fresh angle, though "viral confession" and healing-through-nature feel familiar. The specific synthesis of icicle patterns as shared artistic language between strangers provides modest transformation of the wounded-artist-finds-connection template.</comment>
