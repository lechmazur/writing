I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through pattern accumulation and gradual transformation rather than causal plot mechanics.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her transformation from celestial researcher to earthbound experimenter tracks well. The internal journey from scientific observation to "kindled humility" lands with earned resonance. However, interiority relies on abstract statements ("quiet architect," "bridge between microscopic and macroscopic") rather than embodied perception, and the butterfly's emergence feels convenient rather than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration closure (butterfly emergence as transformation symbol) lands effectively under the Accumulative lens. The piece teaches its pattern of dust accumulation early and pays it off. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two. The cost—Elara's shift from "needless drama" to humble acceptance—reads more conceptually than viscerally, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively shapes the narrative as both decay site and transformation canvas. Sensory detail ("thin fabric barely insulating," "brackish water," "long shadows through broken glass") grounds the atmosphere. The micro-setting of dust patterns constrains and enables Elara's experiments throughout, earning the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on Elara's personal transformation from drama-stripping to meaning-finding. The dust experiments provide gradual deepening rather than reversals, appropriate for the Accumulative lens. While the butterfly emergence reweights prior material, the lack of visible trade-offs or foreclosed paths limits the score—Elara gains insight without sacrificing anything tangible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the dust-to-butterfly transformation arc, avoiding explicit moralizing. The parallel between neutron star decay and greenhouse decay creates resonant layers. The final image offers a non-literal answer about resilience through gradual change. Some abstraction ("bridge between microscopic and macroscopic") weakens embodiment but doesn't break thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with scientific precision bleeding into wonder. POV control is stable throughout. However, register drift into academic abstraction ("preprocessing reality," "accumulated patterns") creates distance during emotional peaks. The prose lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices like a generic scientist rather than this particular character with her specific losses.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose clarity suffers from abstract phrasing and conceptual loops. "Gradual change" and variants appear five times; "decay" six times. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("It was as if..." appears twice; "She had begun to..." twice). The butterfly emergence paragraph contains three filter constructions in succession, dulling immediacy during the climactic moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dust-as-consciousness concept offers modest freshness, though the scientist-finds-meaning-in-nature arc follows familiar templates. The neutron star researcher angle provides specificity but doesn't transform the core premise. The butterfly metamorphosis metaphor, while competently executed, lacks the unexpected synthesis that would elevate originality.</comment>
