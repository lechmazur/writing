I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—decoding signals to protect humanity from cosmic deception—with concrete embodied details like "fingers tracing constellations" and tactical choices (counter-frequency deployment). The cautious hope manifests through specific actions and internal consistency holds, though the cosmic trickster concept lacks the visceral immediacy that would elevate characterization further.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: signal disrupts → Elara decodes → deploys counter-frequency → temporary victory while community divides. Closure achieves Earned Stasis as Elara commits to vigilance with visible cost (isolation in her "small bastion"), though the cosmic stakes remain somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The radio station setting constrains choices effectively—outdated equipment limits options, the subwoofer becomes the crucial tool for counter-attack. Sensory detail like "air thick with the hum" and "boots echoing on concrete" creates atmosphere while the astronomical charts and spectrograph serve as active tools rather than mere props.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from technical disruption to community division with Elara's counter-frequency as the decisive intervention. The dominant stake (preventing cosmic manipulation) drives action with visible cost in her isolation, though the trickster antagonists remain too abstract to generate maximum pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between human ingenuity and cosmic forces, with subtext in Elara's grit against vast unknowable powers. The final image of the "small bastion" resonates as humanity's fragile position, though the power play concept could be more concretely dramatized rather than asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with technical precision ("spectrograph," "subsonic frequencies") appropriate to Elara's expertise, and perceptual signature shows in how she reads patterns others miss. Dialogue between Elara and Hank efficiently advances conflict with natural speech patterns and clear subtext about priorities.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm shifts from technical description to action, though some phrases edge toward the generic ("vast, unforgiving arena"). Information density is solid with most sentences advancing multiple story elements, particularly in the signal analysis sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The concept of using subsonic counter-frequencies to combat cosmic signals shows originality, and the specific university radio station setting grounds the cosmic conflict. However, the "cosmic trickster" antagonist and some phrasing ("bastion of human ingenuity") lean toward familiar SF tropes without sufficient transformation.</comment>
