<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli's determination reads consistently through deliberate forge work and the choice to risk the mines, with visible cost in surrendering his "awakening." The internal shift at closure—"both more and less himself"—lacks embodied specificity, relying on abstract phrasing rather than concrete perception shifts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore linkage from stranger's arrival through mine descent to planet healing. The "awakening" cost remains conceptually vague—we see Eli changed but the precise nature and price of this transformation lacks concrete dramatization, weakening closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The floating rock arches and molten core create vivid anchors, but the setting rarely constrains choices—Eli simply walks through dangerous mines without specific obstacles forcing tactical decisions. The "orchard planet" detail emerges late and doesn't shape action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal forge work to planetary salvation, with the "awakening" trade creating tension. However, the mine descent summarizes danger ("walls crumbling") without dramatizing specific obstacles or near-failures that would heighten pressure through concrete choice points.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of resilience from rubble emerges through Eli's journey and the planet's renewal, with the silk as vessel for restoration. The "awakening" concept needed more concrete exploration—what exactly did Eli trade, and how does his confusion/understanding duality manifest beyond abstract statement?</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with measured prose matching Eli's quiet determination. Some passages drift into elevated register ("liquid light," "otherworldly cadence") that feels less grounded than the forge-worker perspective, and dialogue lacks subtext—the stranger states intentions directly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose flows cleanly but tends toward tell-heavy summary, particularly in the mine descent ("Hours turned into days") and the healing sequence. Figurative language occasionally strains ("floating rock arches pierced the sky like jagged teeth") without earning its density through payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The magical silk restoring a planet through weaving into runes follows familiar fantasy patterns without distinctive transformation. Eli as meek blacksmith-savior and the mysterious stranger with magical objects are genre staples executed competently but without fresh inflection.</comment>
