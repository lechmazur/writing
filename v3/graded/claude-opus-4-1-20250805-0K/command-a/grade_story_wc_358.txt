<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her investigative mindset consistent, but her internal experience lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final realization about predictability arrives through deduction rather than embodied struggle with cost. Her competence dominates without genuine vulnerability or blind spots that would compound pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage as Elara pieces together the crash, but closure lacks visible cost on the page—her mission continues unchanged. The revelation about the flight engineer's attempted landing provides knowledge change but no decisive alteration to Elara's options or stance. The "silence of the town" remains abstract rather than a concrete consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail (saltwater, metal, creaking containers) and the wind-funnel effect directly causes the crash. However, the environment doesn't constrain Elara's choices in the present investigation—she moves through it unimpeded. The port functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active pressure on her decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the disaster to prevent future ones—is signaled early but faces no meaningful tightening or opposition. Elara's investigation proceeds without obstacles, reversals, or competing pressures that would force trade-offs. The discovered truth about wind patterns doesn't alter her tactics or require sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of foresight versus hindsight emerges through the investigation but resolves into explicit statement: "cultivating foresight in action was not just a job—it was a mission." The patch functions as a symbol but doesn't constrain choices or accumulate meaning beyond its initial memorial value. The ending tells rather than resonates through image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and Elara's investigative lens shapes perception effectively. However, dialogue is absent where it might have added texture, and some phrases drift toward corporate register ("singular convergence," "rapidly adapting mind") that feel prompt-derived rather than voice-organic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and effective atmospheric description. However, several template phrases appear ("moved with hazy precision," "rapidly adapting mind," "singular convergence") that read as prompt artifacts. The phrase "cultivating foresight in action" repeats verbatim, creating a loop. Information density is moderate but some passages summarize rather than dramatize.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The accident investigation framework is competently executed but follows predictable beats without transformation. The reveal about wind patterns amplifying the storm is logical but not surprising. The story doesn't risk bold choices or offer fresh angles on the investigator-at-disaster-site template.</comment>
