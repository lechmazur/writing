<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's blindness and unique gift of absorbing languages through skin create a distinctive character with clear motivation to map emotional depths. The internal journey from seeking external depths to finding them within shows genuine transformation with visible cost. However, the epiphany feels slightly rushed and could benefit from more embodied contradiction during the pivotal stillpoint moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's realization that the uncharted depths lie within, with the compass ring's eternal stillness serving as tangible cost/change. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and emotional languages build toward the stillpoint revelation. The closure lands cleanly with "the greatest maps are those of the heart," though the final third tends toward summary rather than scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest and liquid silence pool create vivid, constraining settings that shape Elara's journey. The synesthetic detail of "liquid silence" rippling with unspoken words effectively charges the climactic moment. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, though some descriptions lean ornamental rather than pressure-driving.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping one's own emotional depths—signals early and deepens when Elara discovers the stillpoint reflects internal rather than external terrain. The musical trail provides coherent escalation under the accumulative lens. However, the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off or foreclosed option that would elevate the cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between external navigation and internal discovery, with the compass ring's shift from endless spinning to stillness providing concrete embodiment. The final image of Elara mapping feelings rather than lands resonates without explicit moralizing. The stillpoint-as-internal-beacon metaphor effectively reweights earlier material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Elara's synesthetic perception, with phrases like "frequencies beyond human hearing" and "liquid silence" creating distinctive texture. POV remains stable throughout. However, some passages drift into elevated diction ("testament to her journey") that feels less character-grounded than the sensory-rich opening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Opening and closing lines effectively bookend the piece with the ultrasonic forest frame. Several phrases show strong compression ("constellation paused in their eternal shifting"). However, repetitive structures appear ("Elara smiled...Elara's story became legend") and the final third contains summary loops that reduce momentum, particularly "a tale of a blind mapmaker who found her way not by sight, but by sound, by touch, by the languages absorbed through her skin."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a blind mapmaker who absorbs languages through skin offers genuine freshness, avoiding disability-as-superpower tropes through specific sensory grounding. The stillpoint as liquid silence containing crystallized emotions provides an original take on internal discovery. The synthesis feels organic rather than assembled from prompt elements.</comment>
