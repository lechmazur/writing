<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "cultivate lightness in grief" through ritualistic whittling and private narration shows consistent internal contradiction, though the brother's death feels told rather than embodied. The carved heart as final gesture lands with some emotional weight but lacks the visceral cost of true renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through whittling, dried flowers, and turbines, culminating in Earned Stasis as Elara continues her resistance ritual. However, the happiness mandate's mechanics remain vague exposition, and the cost—while conceptually present in the brother's fate—doesn't viscerally land in the final image of the carved heart.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The turbines-as-sentinels and farmhouse-as-sanctuary create effective spatial pressure, with shadow imagery constraining Elara's world. The whittled wood and dried flowers function as micro-settings that shape her choices, though the broader mandate world lacks tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—maintaining authentic grief under enforced happiness—is clear but static; Elara's whittling ritual doesn't escalate or tighten options, merely continues. The brother's loss provides backstory cost but no present-tense pressure that forces new tactics or trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of private resistance through cultivated grief emerges through concrete objects (flowers, carved heart) rather than statement. The final image of the heart "pulsing faintly" beside dried flowers offers resonance, though the piece edges toward explicit thematic narration with "honor her grief, to cultivate lightness."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The POV maintains consistent distance with controlled interiority like "The knife cuts, the wood yields, and yet, nothing changes" that captures Elara's performative mindset. Some register elevation ("microcosm of her inner world") slightly strains the voice but doesn't break it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with purposeful repetition of "whittled" and "dried flowers" that builds texture, though phrases like "emotional void" and "morally ambiguous figure" lean abstract. The final paragraph's "quiet resolve hardened" and thematic summary dulls momentum slightly. Filter verbs ("seemed to echo," "seemed to pulse") weaken key images.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The happiness mandate dystopia offers a workable premise, and the private whittling-as-resistance has specificity. However, the emotional territory of grief-under-surveillance feels familiar, and the resolution into continued quiet resistance takes few risks.</comment>
