<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to belong drives consistent choices throughout, with her sympathy opening connections and her dedication to finding Echo creating concrete stakes. The transformation from outsider to belonging is earned through accumulated acts of understanding, though internal contradictions could be more embodied in scene rather than summarized ("craved connection").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure - Lira's recognition and belonging achieved through Echo's tag on her sculpture, reweighting her journey. The cost is felt in the "luminescent ache" softening and months of searching, though the Echo encounter itself lacks concrete dramatization, relying on summary ("revealed no face, only a voice").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor with shifting patterns effectively mirror themes of connection and belonging. Setting constrains choices through the crater's geography and the arbor as beacon, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("hues of violet and gold").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on belonging, with escalation through Lira's expanding search from orchard to settlements. The final recognition provides closure but lacks a decisive trade-off or visible price beyond time invested - the resolution comes too easily through Echo's appearance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of kinship as something woven rather than grasped emerges beautifully through concrete actions - sculptures incorporating others' tales, the search creating bridges. The final image of the tagged sculpture as recognition resonates without moralizing, reweighting Lira's entire journey.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent distance with selective perception reflecting Lira's artistic focus ("fingers, calloused from years"). However, the Echo encounter shifts into vague omniscient territory ("a voice that seemed to come from everywhere"), and some passages drift into explanatory mode rather than embodied experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose flows adequately but suffers from abstract summarizing ("boldly sympathetic nature," "quiet warmth") and repetitive structures. The Echo scene particularly lacks concrete detail, defaulting to telling over showing. Some elegant moments ("where the sky bled into the earth") are undermined by scaffolding phrases.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of street art, marsh-reed sculpture, and community-building offers fresh angle on belonging narratives. The obsidian arbor as living beacon and Echo as absence-presence show originality, though the resolution's convenience (Echo simply appearing) reduces risk-taking impact.</comment>
