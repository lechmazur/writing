<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "thresh meaning from chaos" drives consistent choices through following rain trails, exploring ruins, and accepting the exchange. Her insomnia and artistic restlessness embody internal conflict concretely. The final transformation to "keeper of stories" feels slightly unearned—the exchange happens too easily without sufficient internal resistance or cost to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: density builds through rain trails→ruins→brooch→map→exchange→painting with new purpose. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara shifts from failed artist to story-keeper, with the cost being her previous identity. The exchange beat lands but lacks visceral price—the old woman appears conveniently without Elara facing real obstacles or sacrifices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Post-water-wars world with tidal islands, bioluminescent algae, and sunken ruins creates vivid, specific atmosphere. The amber brooch's warmth and the geometry-defying chamber add texture. Setting constrains choices through rain trails guiding movement and the cove's natural archway framing the exchange—environment actively shapes the narrative path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on Elara's search for artistic meaning, which escalates through discovery (brooch→map→exchange location) but lacks genuine obstacles. The old woman's appearance feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle. While the exchange reweights Elara's purpose, no competing force tests her commitment or extracts meaningful cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of art as preservation/transmission emerges through the island-as-archive concept and Elara becoming story-keeper. The exchange of brooch for book literalizes passing knowledge across time. However, the wisdom arrives too easily through the old woman's explanation rather than Elara earning insight through struggle—thematic resolution feels slightly gifted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with phrases like "tapestry of parched lands" and "haggard aftermath." POV stays cleanly with Elara throughout. The old woman's dialogue ("These are the stories of the island") veers toward exposition, and some descriptions edge purple ("eyes like storm clouds"), but overall texture remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery ("droplets formed trails that seemed to lead somewhere"). Some overwriting appears ("tapestry of parched lands and reclaimed seas," "ancient sentinels") but doesn't obscure meaning. The ending paragraph maintains momentum while landing the transformation, though "haggard awe" feels forced as a callback.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Post-water-wars setting with mystical rain trails and island-as-living-archive offers fresh worldbuilding. The convergence of past/present through ruins and the exchange mechanism show originality. However, the wise-crone-with-ancient-knowledge trope and artist-finds-purpose arc follow familiar patterns without sufficient transformation to reach higher bands.</comment>
