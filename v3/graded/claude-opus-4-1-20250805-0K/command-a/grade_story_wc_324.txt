<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to protect vulnerable voices drives her actions consistently, and her curiosity propels the search forward with clear internal stakes. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat linear without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—she moves from curiosity to resolution without significant internal conflict or cost visible in her choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara accepting the photograph and its implied responsibility, with the cost being her ongoing commitment to finding more lost stories. The accumulative/textural lens holds as atmospheric details and whispers build toward the final image of the "reeling hush" as her companion. Minor deduction for the relatively abstract nature of the cost—while emotionally resonant, the specific price Elara pays remains somewhat conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium creates genuine atmosphere that constrains movement and perception, with the hearing aid's pulses serving as a micro-setting element that guides action. The environment actively shapes Elara's search path and the thickening mist mirrors emotional weight effectively. The setting achieves the 9+ gate requirement as the atrium and hearing aid constrain choices throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting a vulnerable voice from being lost—is clear and maintains coherent pressure through the accumulative lens. The escalation from faint whispers to clearer communication provides one meaningful deepening. However, the resolution lacks a visceral trade-off or foreclosed option that would elevate the cost beyond the conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of preserving forgotten stories emerges organically through concrete action rather than statement, with the photograph serving as a resonant particular. The ending reweights the opening's "contact tracer for hearts" metaphor effectively. Limited by relatively straightforward thematic development without significant complexity or counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the Gothic atmosphere, with controlled psychic distance and no POV slippage. Perceptual signature shows in how Elara processes the supernatural through technical/professional lens ("contact tracer," "pulses," "tracking"). Minor repetition in emotional descriptors ("curiosity" appears four times) prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with atmospheric momentum and varied sentence structures. However, several instances of telling over showing ("Her curiosity drove her forward," "her incidental heroism") and some redundancy in describing the mist and whispers. The phrase "reeling hush" appears three times without evolving meaning, creating mild repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of a "contact tracer for hearts" investigating calls from the dead offers a fresh synthesis of detective and supernatural elements. The specific combination of modern professional role with Gothic atmosphere creates originality. The execution remains somewhat safe, following expected beats without significant risk-taking that would access the bonus range.</comment>
