<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like fingers tracing the journal spine and her breath catching at the code. The final choice to parley shows agency, though the guardian figure's emergence and immediate dissolution lacks the contradictory impulses or visible cost needed for higher bands. Her internal state remains somewhat static through the encounter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the lagoon encounter. Closure occurs as Charged Poise—Elara's parley creates a crystallized moment where "the sands themselves were holding their breath" with promise of truth's release. However, the cost remains abstract ("no matter how painful") rather than viscerally felt on-page, and the guardian's immediate dissolution deflates potential pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The zeppelin library and obsidian lagoon create distinctive settings that shape Elara's choices—the aerial perspective enables her journey, while the lagoon's dark waters become the site of contact. Sensory details like "shadow stretching like a dark whisper" and boots sinking in sand ground the action. The beach debris arrangement constrains her communication method effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering buried truth—is signaled early through the encrypted diary. Pressure builds modestly through Elara's descent, ritual arrangement, and waiting, but the guardian's appearance and quick dissolution prevents meaningful escalation. The encounter lacks the tightening or trade-off that would foreclose options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete tension between silence and revelation, with the diary's "voices long silenced" demanding to be told. The beach debris messages and the guardian's ancient knowing create resonance without explicit moralizing. However, the ending's promise that "truth would finally be set free" tends toward abstraction rather than earned specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with elevated diction appropriate to Elara's archivist profession ("solemn," "cryptic entries," "retrocognitively trapped"). The narrative distance remains stable, and perceptual signature shows in her specific attention to texts and codes. The guardian's dialogue "Why have you come?" carries appropriate weight, though limited dialogue prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. Some overwriting appears ("shadow stretching like a dark whisper," "burned like a torch") without pattern-teaching. The phrase "retrocognitively trapped" feels forced, and abstract declarations like "truth would finally be set free" lack concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The floating library on a zeppelin offers fresh setting, and arranging beach debris as messages provides an inventive communication method. However, the core premise of discovering encrypted historical secrets follows familiar patterns. The guardian figure's emergence and cryptic exchange doesn't transform the expected arc of truth-seeking narratives.</comment>
