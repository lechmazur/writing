I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This reads as Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through atmospheric details, ghost appearances, and symbolic objects toward a resonant reconfiguration where Marcus heals both building and spirits through the clock repair.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to "discover what ceilings hide" drives consistent action, and his gift creates genuine tension between ordinary work and supernatural calling. The character shows competent progression but lacks deeper contradiction - his choices feel predetermined rather than conflicted. The ghosts function more as guides than pressure points.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the clock repair heals both building and ghosts, with emotional warmth as the felt cost of Marcus's "weightless burden." However, the accumulative progression feels mechanical - each discovery leads too smoothly to the next without genuine resistance. The mainspring-to-clock connection reads as convenient rather than earned through pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus setting effectively pressures choices through its decay and hidden spaces, with strong sensory work ("scent of sawdust and popcorn"). The ceiling as concealment space directly enables the closure. Details like dust patterns and facade cracks serve both atmosphere and plot function.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake of discovering hidden truths progresses steadily but lacks meaningful tightening. Marcus faces no real opposition or cost - the ghosts help rather than hinder, the barrel fits perfectly, the clock works immediately. The "weightless burden" never manifests as actual weight or resistance that would force difficult choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of hidden truths and healing through discovery emerges organically from events. The facade metaphor works both literally and symbolically. However, the resolution feels too neat - "The facade was whole again" - without exploring the complexity suggested by "cracks always reappeared."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited with Marcus's technical perspective coloring descriptions ("methodical approach," "diagnosing"). Some effective moments like "weightless burden" capture paradox well. However, dialogue absence removes a key tool for voice distinction, and several phrases feel workshop-generic ("felt most alive," "sense of closure he hadn't known he needed").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and decent momentum. However, multiple template phrases weaken impact: "chill ran down his spine," "heart pounding," "warmth spread through him." The paraphrase loop around Marcus's gift (paragraph 1 and 4) and some filter-heavy passages ("he felt a pull," "he noticed") dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The elevator technician who sees ghosts offers mild freshness, but the execution follows predictable beats - mysterious object leads to hidden treasure that solves everything. The circus setting and horologist elements feel grafted rather than organically synthesized. No real transformation of the ghost-story template occurs.</comment>
