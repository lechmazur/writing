<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to catch the goddess's echo is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like "calloused hands" and the "pull in his chest." The final choice to use the rail spike as a tether shows earned agency. However, internal conflict remains mostly stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the emotional progression toward acceptance feels somewhat smooth rather than layered with genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the garden is restored with the goddess's echo woven into its fabric. The cost is legible in Kael's transformation from fisher to keeper of the echo. However, the middle section lacks sufficient density increase before the goddess appears, and the causality of why the rail spike becomes a "key" feels asserted rather than earned through prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vivid and constrains choice—Kael must navigate by listening to silence and following vibrations. Sensory details like "the air hummed with vibrations" and "silence had a voice" create a specific, lived-in environment. The setting directly enables the resolution when "the garden erupted into sound." Minor deduction for some abstract descriptions that could be more concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—catching the goddess's echo—is signaled early and maintained. Escalation occurs through the constellations freezing and the goddess appearing, with cost visible in Kael's role transformation. However, the conflict lacks genuine pressure points where Kael must make difficult choices; his zigzag walk and the goddess's appearance feel more like progression than earned escalation under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "voicing silence" and finding harmony between wild and still. The final image of the restored garden with Kael as keeper resonates without stating a moral. The rail spike's transformation from found object to tether creates meaningful reconfiguration. Slight deduction for the goddess's dialogue veering toward explicit theme statement: "to be both wild and still."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with lyrical descriptions fitting the mystical setting. Perceptual signature shows in how Kael experiences the garden through sound and vibration. Dialogue between Kael and goddess carries appropriate register. However, some passages drift into elevated diction ("transliterating emotions") that doesn't fully align with a fisher's POV, and filter phrases occasionally dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition of key phrases like "feral lullaby." Most sentences advance story or atmosphere effectively. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("transliterating into the language of the cosmos") and near-paraphrase loops ("The garden itself was alive with sound...It was a place where silence had a voice") reduce momentum. The phrase "transliterating emotions" appears three times without sufficient variation or deepening.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept of a sound wave garden where silence has voice offers fresh specificity, and the paradox of catching an echo through stillness provides non-obvious synthesis. The transformation of a rail spike into a mystical tether shows creative risk. Deduction for the somewhat familiar fantasy template of mortal meeting goddess and the resolution feeling slightly predetermined rather than discovered through struggle.</comment>
