<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's internal state carries specificity through his stained hands and magnetic pull toward stories, with the donor heart providing concrete motivation. The widow's arc from guarded to vulnerable lands authentically. However, the resolution relies on abstract wisdom-speak ("holding on...allows us to fly") rather than embodied struggle, and Kael's "quietly explosive" mind gets labeled but never dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Kael's gift drawing him to the widow's story, culminating in shared understanding. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as both characters reach new awareness about carrying stories. However, cost remains conceptual rather than visceral—we see emotional exchange but no concrete price paid or path foreclosed, weakening the before/after legibility required for higher scores.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating tea house creates atmospheric pressure through its "cloud-kissed plateau" and transforms mundane space into sanctuary. The blue morpho wing functions as micro-setting, its iridescence casting kaleidoscope colors that halt conversation and enable connection. Setting constrains choice when Kael uses the wing's light-play to track story-threads, though the "misty valley" ending feels generic after such specific earlier detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why people magnetize stories—gets explored through Kael's encounter with the widow. Pressure accumulates as her grief surfaces ("My husband died a year ago"), but escalation remains conversational without forcing trade-offs. The resolution offers philosophical comfort without requiring either character to sacrifice or choose between competing goods, limiting the felt cost needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the blue morpho's dual nature (beauty/fragility) and the metaphor of stories as magnetic threads. The widow's dilemma about holding versus releasing grief creates genuine complexity. Yet the ending slides into explicit moralizing ("stories that magnetize us...meant to be shared, to illuminate"), replacing earned resonance with stated thesis, particularly in Kael's speech about illuminating paths for others.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Kael's perception filters effectively through dye-master specificity ("stained with hues of indigo and saffron") and his synesthetic gift of feeling stories as "magnetic pulls." Dialogue carries naturalistic rhythm and subtext, particularly the widow's careful questions. However, both characters converge into wisdom-speak register during emotional peaks ("Sometimes, holding on is what keeps us afloat"), losing distinct voices when differentiation matters most.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of sensory precision ("wooden beams groaning softly," "tea-stained lips") and varies rhythm effectively. Major deductions for repetitive abstract phrasing around "stories" and "illuminate" without concrete grounding, plus template constructions ("He could feel...He focused on...He approached"). The philosophical dialogue exchanges read as position statements rather than embodied speech, creating momentum drag in the central scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The donor heart creating story-magnetism offers a fresh angle on empathic connection, and the blue morpho wing as divination tool shows originality. The floating tea house sanctuary creates distinctive atmosphere. However, the grief-counseling arc follows familiar templates, and the resolution's wisdom about sharing stories to illuminate others' paths lands as therapeutic commonplace rather than earned insight.</comment>
