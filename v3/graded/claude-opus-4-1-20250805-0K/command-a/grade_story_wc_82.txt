<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's grief-driven craftsmanship creates genuine internal conflict between his need to transform pain and Lira's challenge to simply feel it. The realization that his detached shadow was a protective shield rather than lost soul demonstrates earned psychological insight. Minor deduction for some therapy-speak ("grief is meant to be felt") in dialogue, though the embodied unfolding of the crane pays this off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration: Kael shifts from trying to craft away grief to honoring it through his work, with visible cost in the unfolding crane scene. The basilica revelation about his shadow-as-shield reweights earlier material effectively. Slight opacity in the "descending while ascending" paradox and its narrative function prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The floating tea garden and glass basilica create atmospheric pressure, with the basilica functioning as both setting and catalyst for transformation. The lanterns as dream-recording vessels add specificity. However, the setting doesn't sufficiently constrain choices until the basilica scene, and some elements (tea garden specifics) remain ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Internal conflict escalates from hollow craft to Lira's intervention to basilica revelation, with the unfolding crane as decisive action carrying emotional cost. The protagonist drives the resolution through his choice to honor rather than escape grief. Missing sharper external pressure or stakes that would create more urgent trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the craft/grief metaphor: attempting to polish sorrow versus accepting its rawness. The origami crane's transformation from plea to memory-holder resonates without stating a moral. The final image of crafting to honor rather than escape grief reweights the opening's "luminous torment" effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third POV with poetic register appropriate to the lantern maker's artistic sensibility. Lira's dialogue carries gentle authority distinct from Kael's rougher voice. Some elevated diction ("luminous torment," "lover's whisper") occasionally feels overwrought, and filter phrases like "he felt a shift" reduce immediacy in key moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and evocative imagery. However, abstract phrases like "hollow craft," "luminous torment," and "paradoxical motion" lack concrete grounding. The opening's "lover's whisper" simile feels forced. Some redundancy in grief descriptions across paragraphs reduces momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dream-recording lanterns offer a fresh angle on grief processing, avoiding simple catharsis narrative. The shadow-as-shield reversal provides genuine insight about protective mechanisms. The transformation from crafting away grief to crafting to honor it feels earned through specific detail rather than generic resolution.</comment>
