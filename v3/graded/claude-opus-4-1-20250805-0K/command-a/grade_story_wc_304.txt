<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve beauty before oblivion is clear and consistent, with her internal shift from capturing sparks to embracing stillness earned through the traveler's intervention. The piece lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—her transformation feels too smooth. The final choice to embrace stillness shows visible cost ("tremor in her soul") but could deepen the internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's shift from seeking movement/sparks to embracing stillness, with the emerald chip serving as catalyst. The accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns build toward the final reweighting. Cost is present but somewhat abstract—"tremor in her soul" and letting go of her previous method—though the closure lands with "newfound understanding."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto with aurora provides atmospheric grounding, and the emerald chip functions as micro-setting that constrains choice when pressed to the traveler's forehead. Setting details like "crystalline walls" and "radiant hush" create mood but don't actively pressure decisions. The grotto transforms from sanctuary to gateway, though this shift could be more tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on Elara's need to capture essence before "oblivion claimed all," with one meaningful deepening when the traveler awakens and reframes her understanding. The shift from seeking sparks to embracing stillness narrows her options and forces a trade-off of her previous method. Cost appears in her trembling hands and the "tremor in her soul," though pressure could intensify.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the spark/stillness dichotomy, with the traveler's words—"sparks are fleeting. It is the stillness that endures"—reweighting all prior imagery. The final image of Elara stepping forward with the steady-lit chip offers a non-literal answer to her quest. Some philosophical articulation ("stillness that held them") edges toward abstraction but remains grounded in scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the fantastical setting, with controlled rhythm that shifts from methodical description to quickened pace during the awakening. Perceptual signature shows in how Elara reads the grotto's walls "as if they held secrets only she could decipher." Some phrases like "beautician mortician" feel forced, and dialogue lacks naturalistic rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the awakening sequence. Information density is moderate—most lines advance atmosphere or character state. Some redundancy appears in repeated descriptions of stillness/movement concepts, and phrases like "ancient and new" or "lucidly watchful" feel like template literary language rather than organic voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The beautician mortician concept offers a fresh angle on death-work, and the reversal of valuing stillness over sparks provides genuine surprise. However, the philosophical resolution feels somewhat familiar—accepting death/stillness as wisdom is well-trodden territory. The emerald chip as life-giving relic doesn't transform its archetypal function enough to feel distinctive.</comment>
