I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, applying the rigorous standards outlined.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered discoveries and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where the lens's completion transforms meaning.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's weariness and stubbornness manifest through concrete actions (searching fragments, piecing the lens), and his motivation to "give rest a permanent address" drives coherent choices. However, his internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously - he proceeds with steady determination without genuine struggle or cost until the abstract ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the lens's completion and light spreading, but the cost remains abstract ("weariness lifting like a tide receding"). The accumulative structure coheres as Elias gathers fragments, yet the final transformation - water parting to reveal stars - introduces unmotivated physics that undermines the established underwater reality without earning this rule change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The underwater library setting pressures choices effectively - Elias must navigate "aisles choked with seaweed," search "behind a waterfall of algae," and work within the drowned city's constraints. Sensory details like "breath fogging the cracked glass" and the water's constant pressure against windows create atmospheric tension that shapes his quest.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake - completing the lens to send a final distress signal - progresses through fragment collection, but escalation remains mechanical rather than costly. Each discovered piece brings Elias "closer to understanding" without forcing trade-offs or narrowing options; the resolution arrives through completion rather than sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of giving voice to the forgotten emerges through the lens reconstruction and final signal, avoiding explicit moralizing. The concept of "rest" evolves from burial to acknowledgment, and the distress signal motif accumulates meaning, though the final paragraph's "impossible spaces are the ones that bring us home" veers toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited with appropriate lexicon for an undertaker ("unburyable," "giving rest to the restless"). However, register drift appears in elevated moments ("ethereal light," "testament to the city's resilience") that clash with Elias's established perspective, and some constructions feel writerly rather than experiential.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose suffers from repetitive constructions ("Elias had come...," "Elias had no idea...," "Elias opened it...") and abstract descriptors replace concrete detail in crucial moments. The phrase "chased stillness" appears without clear meaning, and the final transformation sequence relies on telling ("water above began to part") rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The underwater library as repository of a sunken city's final moments offers a fresh angle, and the lighthouse lens as both broken relic and soul conduit provides originality. However, the undertaker-giving-rest metaphor feels somewhat forced, and the resolution's magical realism (water parting) arrives without sufficient groundwork.</comment>
