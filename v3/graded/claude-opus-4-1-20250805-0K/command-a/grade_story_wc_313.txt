<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve the town's memory is clear and consistent, but lacks internal contradiction or complexity during the discovery sequence. The final act of creating the exhibit shows agency with implied emotional cost, though the transformation feels somewhat mechanical without deeper character-specific struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias discovering photographs that build toward the exhibit's creation. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the town emotionally resurfaces through shared memory, with cost implied in years of collective amnesia. However, the discovery sequence lacks sufficient pressure or complication to fully earn the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The reservoir, ridgeway, and town square are adequately anchored with selective details like "damp earth" and "stars...like pinholes." The setting provides the trail structure but doesn't actively constrain choices or create pressure beyond serving as a backdrop for discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering the town's forgotten identity—is signaled early through the "mirrored hush" and empty reservoir. However, escalation remains gentle as Elias faces no meaningful opposition or cost during his discovery, and the resolution arrives without sufficient pressure to test his commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of collective memory versus amnesia emerges organically through the photographs and liqueur label, with "L'Oubliée—The Forgotten" serving as a concrete anchor. The final image of the framed label as beacon resonates thematically, though the piece could explore more complexity in what deserves remembering versus forgetting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The voice maintains consistent distance with moments of effective imagery ("stars...like pinholes in a dark cloth"). However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature for Elias beyond generic observation, and occasionally drifts into elevated register ("expunge the town's amnesia") that doesn't fully match a levee warden's likely lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates competent clarity with varied sentence structure, though several instances of overwriting appear ("vigilant levee warden," "precisely humane," "mirrored hush"). The phrase "resurfacing" appears four times, creating mild repetition, and some passages tend toward abstract summary rather than concrete detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The concept of memory artifacts leading to communal healing offers a fresh angle on small-town restoration narratives. The liqueur label as catalyst for recovery shows specificity, though the execution follows predictable beats without surprising turns or deeper complexity in the town's relationship to its past.</comment>
