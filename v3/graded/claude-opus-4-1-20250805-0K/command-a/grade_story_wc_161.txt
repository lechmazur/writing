<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve lost songs drives consistent action throughout, with concrete embodiment in her pigeon training and dust-mapping rituals. The final moment of self-preservation alongside song preservation shows earned transformation with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("blooming and withering parts of her soul") and the somewhat convenient resolution of internal fragmentation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (dust motes, songs, messages) leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara achieves integration. The mysterious letter provides the key turn that reframes the dust as meaningful pattern rather than chaos. Closure lands with earned stasis as she preserves herself alongside the songs, though the cost could be more visceral—it's felt but somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The attic setting functions as more than backdrop—its dust motes become the central discovery mechanism, the skylight frames the observational space, and the "musty air and crumbling books" create atmospheric pressure. The Mars meteorite chip serves as a grounding object that constrains choice and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout with selective, purposeful detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving lost songs while managing personal fragmentation—intensifies through the letter's arrival and subsequent discovery that "the songs are in the dust." This revelation narrows Elara's options and forces focused action. The escalation follows the accumulative lens appropriately, though the resolution feels slightly too neat without sufficient visible struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of preservation versus reinvention emerges through concrete particulars: the meteorite chip representing possibility/loss, the dust patterns as hidden order, the pigeons carrying fragments of truth. The final synthesis of self-preservation alongside song preservation offers resonance without explicit moralizing. Some thematic statements ("blooming and withering") edge toward abstraction rather than remaining fully embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on patterns, fragments, and atmospheric detail that reflects Elara's fragmented state. Free indirect style works cleanly throughout. Minor register elevation in places ("extraterrestrial origin could ground her") slightly exceeds the established voice's natural lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose generally maintains clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is adequate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "blooming and withering" (appears 3 times), some abstract constructions ("paper trail of half-truths"), and occasional overwriting in figurative language ("symphony of blooming and withering").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of mapping dust motes to recover lost songs offers a fresh angle on memory and preservation. The synthesis of pigeon training with attic scholarship creates specificity. However, the resolution mechanism feels somewhat convenient, and the "lost songs of childhood" trope is familiar without sufficient transformation through lived detail.</comment>
