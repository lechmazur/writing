I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as the piece builds through layered imagery and symbolic resonance rather than strict causal chains, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the archive's divergence creates new possibilities.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to cultivate sparks is clear and embodied through concrete actions (carrying the clock, using the charm), and her final understanding that she must "protect their divergence" shows earned growth. However, interiority relies on abstract phrases like "felt its weight as a reminder" without specific embodied emotion, and the character lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the archive transforms and Mara understands her expanded role, with the clock's restarted time marking genuine change. The accumulative progression from dune to archive to divergent futures coheres well. Deducting for slight ambiguity in the cost—while hope and renewal are present, the specific price Mara pays remains somewhat abstract ("knowing she had done what she came to do").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glowing dune and divergent archive create vivid, purposeful settings that directly enable choices—the dune guides Mara's path, the archive responds to the clock. Strong sensory work with "luminescent sand," "vortex of light," and "floating orbs." The environment constrains and shapes the entire narrative arc, particularly how the sand "shifted beneath her feet, guiding her path."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from finding the archive to discovering it's dying to enabling its divergent renewal. The charm's activation creates a clear turning point that deepens pressure. However, the resolution comes too easily—the clock simply works when held aloft without struggle or trade-off, missing the opportunity for a more costly choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete interplay of frozen time/renewal and singular preservation/divergent possibility. The final image of "sparks diverging, creating new possibilities" resonates without stating a moral. The clock's transformation from frozen relic to active timekeeper effectively embodies the thematic arc of stasis to generative change.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent mythic-poetic register with controlled rhythm, particularly strong in "The dune whispered to her, its voice a fractured lullaby." Some filter-heavy passages ("Mara felt a surge of hope, knowing she had done") and abstract constructions ("its purpose long forgotten") dilute immediacy during key moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("glowing sands swirling around her in a vortex of light") but suffers from abstract tell-phrases: "felt its weight as a reminder," "felt important," "strange pull." Several paraphrase loops appear: "divergent archive, a place where memories and dreams converged" followed immediately by restatement about "sparks of the unlit corners."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting with mystical archive and time-manipulation creates fresh ground. The concept of sparks that diverge rather than simply reignite offers genuine originality. However, some elements feel templated—the mysterious inherited object, the chosen-one journey structure—without sufficient transformation.</comment>
