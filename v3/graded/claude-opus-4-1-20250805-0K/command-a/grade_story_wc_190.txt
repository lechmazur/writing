<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his method of curating silence for passengers. Mira's internal turmoil resolves through earned experience, though her initial restlessness could be more specifically embodied. The storm glass vial effectively externalizes emotional states, creating visible stakes for the central conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the storm glass vial's reactions building to Mira's transformation. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira finds peace through silence, with cost visible in her weeks of prior anxiety now released. Orientation anchors (gondola, terrace, Elias/Mira) establish cleanly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace with its "vaulting hush" and fractured light creates atmospheric pressure that shapes the entire journey. The floating garden's absolute silence becomes the crucible for Mira's transformation. Sensory details (jasmine scent, light/shadow interplay) are selective and support the dominant stake of finding comfort in silence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on Mira's need for refuge from chaos, with the storm glass vial tracking emotional turbulence as visible pressure. The gondola's course adjustment and arrival at the floating garden create meaningful deepening that enables her transformation. Cost is legible in her weeks of unraveling anxiety finally released.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the storm glass vial as "mirror for the soul" and the concept that silence is "the space where everything can be heard." The final image of Mira departing with lighter steps while the vial glows with inner light resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent philosophical calm through Elias's POV with selective perception focused on silence and emotional currents. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("Isn't silence just… nothing?"). Some register elevation in philosophical passages ("the transit of their own emotions") slightly strains the gondola operator's lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose flows with purposeful rhythm matching the serene journey, though several abstract passages lack concrete grounding ("curate those moments," "emotional currents"). Template phrasing appears in transitions ("As they approached," "As they resumed"). The "fluidly logical" descriptor feels forced rather than organic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The storm glass vial as sound-reactive emotional mirror offers a fresh device for externalizing internal states. However, the wise ferryman archetype and journey-to-enlightenment structure follow familiar patterns without sufficient transformation through specific detail.</comment>
