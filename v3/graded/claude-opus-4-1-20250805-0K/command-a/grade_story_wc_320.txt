<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "find the beginning in every ending" drives consistent action through tuning the shard, though her internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—she proceeds with steady confidence rather than genuine struggle. The progression from discarding assumptions about silence to understanding it as "space where all possibilities began" shows earned insight, but emotional complexity remains thin with phrases like "strange sense of peace" lacking specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the city's rebirth and Elara's self-discovery, with visible cost in letting go of assumptions. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the piece builds through layered discoveries about the shard's nature, though the transformation from "abandoned" to "reborn" city feels somewhat abrupt without intermediate stakes or resistance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The suspended city over the gorge and skeletal radio towers create atmospheric setting, with the lunar perigee providing temporal pressure. However, the environment doesn't meaningfully constrain Elara's choices—she simply stands and tunes without the tower's precarious position or the gorge creating actual obstacles or forcing tactical decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake of unlocking the shard's power escalates through two realizations about silence and the shard's nature, with the lunar perigee deadline adding urgency. The cost of "discarding assumptions" manifests in Elara's methodical letting go, though the lack of genuine resistance or competing options limits the pressure—success feels assured rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of beginnings within endings emerges through the shard's transformation from relic to "promise of the future" and the city's rebirth. The insight that "silence was not the absence of sound but the space where all possibilities began" resonates conceptually, though the final paragraph's explicit articulation ("She had found the beginning in every ending") edges toward direct moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and atmospheric word choices like "skeletal fingers" and "serenely electric." However, Elara's perceptual signature lacks distinction—her observations of static, melody, and light could belong to any technician rather than revealing her specific way of noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and atmospheric details, though several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "The shard of hush was not just a relic; it was a key" followed immediately by "not just a relic of the past; it was a promise of the future" recycles the same construction. Template phrasing appears in "She smiled faintly, her heart steady" and similar emotional summaries that tell rather than embody states.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of a "celestial signal interpreter" tuning a "shard of hush" during lunar perigee offers a fresh synthesis of elements, and the idea that silence contains possibilities rather than emptiness provides genuine insight. However, the execution follows predictable beats—discovery, setback, deeper understanding, triumph—without surprising turns or complications that would elevate beyond competent genre work.</comment>
