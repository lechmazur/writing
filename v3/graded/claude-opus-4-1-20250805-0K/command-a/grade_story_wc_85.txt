I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This is primarily an **Accumulative/Textural** piece, building density through imagery (cobalt terrace, driftwood carvings, watch hand) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elias acknowledges his complicity and the fractured nature of his soul.

<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's guilt manifests through embodied details like the watch "biting into his palm" and his methodical examination of driftwood. His internal conflict between professional detachment and moral awareness drives credible choices, though the epiphany about the erased heir feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of fractured tiles reflecting Elias's fractured soul, with visible cost in his "trembling legs" and carried truth. However, the revelation about the client's father feels inserted rather than organically discovered, and the accumulative pattern could tighten more decisively toward closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore create atmospheric pressure, with driftwood carvings serving as both setting and metaphorical device. The "sieved hush" and salt/decay sensory details ground the piece, though the setting could more actively constrain Elias's choices rather than serving primarily as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Internal conflict escalates from unease to crushing guilt as Elias moves through the driftwood pieces, with the watch hand serving as tangible pressure. The stakes deepen when he aligns the watch with the clock carving, though the resolution lacks a decisive external test that would fully crystallize the cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of fractured surfaces reflecting fractured truths, avoiding explicit moralizing. The driftwood carvings (face, reaching hand, broken clock) build thematic resonance, though the connection between genealogical forgery and personal redemption could develop more subtly through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, particularly in passages like "the sieved hush deepening into silence." The perceptual signature focuses on surfaces and fragments appropriately for a forger, though some phrases like "tempered regret" feel slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("cobalt terrace seemed to shimmer, its tiles reflecting the fading sky like a fractured mirror") but suffers from overwriting in places. Phrases like "the weight of unspoken words pressing down on him like a physical force" and "gnawing at him like a relentless tide" pile on similes where one would suffice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The genealogist-as-forger premise offers fresh angle on identity and truth, with the driftwood divination adding originality. However, the resolution follows predictable redemption arc, and the "fractured mirror/fractured soul" metaphor, while effective, isn't particularly innovative.</comment>
