<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The arsonist's motivation remains abstract ("rescue a forgotten promise") without embodied emotional stakes or internal contradiction during the quest. The character functions more as a vehicle for plot mechanics than a person with conflicting impulses, though the final tears suggest unexplored depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal chain (clues lead to discovery) but lacks a decisive change with visible cost—finding and reading the scroll produces tears but no altered options or foreclosed paths. The "closure" is discovery without transformation, missing the required on-page cost that would make a before/after legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The archive setting provides atmosphere and houses the quest objects effectively, with selective details like "stone floors" and "ethereal glow" supporting the mood. However, the environment never constrains choices or forces adaptation—the arsonist moves through spaces without the setting affecting tactics or creating obstacles.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract throughout ("rescue a forgotten promise") without concrete pressure that narrows options or forces trade-offs. The trail of clues provides momentum but no meaningful escalation—each discovery leads smoothly to the next without cost or complication that would test commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of preserving legacy emerges through concrete images (tapestry, portrait, mural) rather than statement, and the final scroll provides thematic resonance about love and sacrifice. However, the theme arrives fully formed in the final revelation without being tested through the protagonist's choices or struggles.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled distance and some distinctive touches like "volcanic tenderness." However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—the arsonist notices things any competent investigator would notice, without character-specific bias or selectivity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and clear progression, though it suffers from repetitive constructions ("The arsonist's..." appears frequently) and some purple patches ("ethereal glow"). Information density is moderate—most sentences advance the plot but rarely do double work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The concept of an arsonist who preserves rather than destroys offers an interesting reversal, and the archaeological mystery provides engagement. However, the execution follows familiar quest-narrative patterns without transforming them through specific character complexity or unexpected turns.</comment>
