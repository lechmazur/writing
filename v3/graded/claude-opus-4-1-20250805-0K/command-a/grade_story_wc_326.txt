<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand her death certificate error is clear and consistent, but internal contradiction remains largely conceptual rather than embodied in scene. The heartbeat counting habit provides texture without meaningful constraint on choices. The final realization about the ghost being her "lost self" feels unearned by prior causality, lacking the concrete struggle that would justify this epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with data fragments coalescing into understanding, but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara gains wisdom without losing anything concrete. The death certificate error creates intrigue but never faces a dramatized test. The resolution that she's "a survivor of the system" arrives through assertion rather than earned transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting with its "frosted dome" and "aged wood" creates atmosphere, and the porcelain shard functions as micro-setting that triggers the ghost's manifestation. However, the environment doesn't constrain choices—the cold, the snow, the isolation could all be removed without affecting Elara's actions or the story's resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding her existence after the death certificate error—remains static throughout as Elara performs technical tasks without facing opposition or making difficult choices. The "digital ghost" provides information but no resistance. No meaningful tightening occurs; the defragmentation process proceeds smoothly to revelation without cost or foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of "fetching wisdom from failure" emerges through the death certificate error and lost timeline concept, with the porcelain shard serving as a physical anchor for loss. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("She had fetched wisdom from failure") rather than letting it resonate through image and action. The ghost's wisdom about "paths untaken" remains abstract without concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with atmospheric touches like "breath visible in the cold," but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices everything with equal clarity. Filter-heavy constructions ("she realized," "she could feel") distance the reader from immediacy. The ghost's dialogue sounds identical to the narration, missing an opportunity for voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "fragments of something larger" followed immediately by "the message was fragmented, scattered." Template phrasing appears throughout ("She traced...," "She leaned...," "She worked..."). The metaphor mixing of "digital ghost" with "whisper in the code" and "presence" creates conceptual muddle. Abstract descriptors like "forgotten secrets" and "forgotten relic" in the opening provide atmosphere without specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept of a death certificate error creating a "digital ghost" of an unlived timeline offers an intriguing premise, but execution relies on familiar mystical-technology fusion without fresh inflection. The transformation from data patterns to self-discovery follows predictable beats. The porcelain shard as conduit between physical and digital feels arbitrary rather than inevitable.</comment>
