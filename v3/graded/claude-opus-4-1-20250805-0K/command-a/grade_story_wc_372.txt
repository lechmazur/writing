<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve and find meaning is clear and consistent, with concrete embodiment through misted breath and gloved hands. The transformation from "gently meticulous" archivist to someone with "newfound urgency" follows causal logic through the slide encounter. However, the epiphany ("she understood that the library was not merely a repository but a conduit") arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient internal contradiction or struggle, and emotions remain primarily told ("her heart alight with purpose") rather than embodied in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara transforms from passive preserver to active connector, with visible cost in her shifted role and the weight of carrying forward the vows. The slide's transformation provides clear causality, and the Drive Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently. Orientation anchors effectively (frozen library, Elara's role established immediately). Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient timing of the slide's message being "meant for her" without earned build-up.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frozen library's crystalline shelves and biting cold effectively constrain Elara's work (gloved handling, misted breath), and the magic lantern acts as essential tool. The "quartz hush" and ethereal prisms create strong atmosphere that supports the preservation theme. Setting evolves meaningfully when "the very clouds acknowledged her efforts." Lacks deeper sensory variety beyond visual/cold, but the library-as-conduit revelation makes setting integral to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Central stake of preserving meaning against oblivion is clear from opening and deepens when Elara discovers the slides are "keys to something greater." The slide transformation creates genuine escalation with visible change (figure now holds lantern). However, the conflict lacks concrete opposition or cost—the transformation happens without struggle or sacrifice, and no clear price is paid for the new understanding beyond accepting responsibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus connection emerges organically through the slide's transformation and Elara's role shift. The recurring light/darkness imagery (lantern bridging void) resonates without heavy-handedness. The final image of Elara "heart alight with purpose" offers a non-literal answer about carrying meaning forward. Slight deduction for the overly neat resolution where all vows gain "new vitality" without exploring complexity or ambiguity in what gets preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and clean focalization through Elara. Voice maintains formal, reverent tone matching the archival setting ("luminous vows etched," "ethereal glow"). Some effective perceptual signature in how she notices light frequencies and slide integrity. However, prose occasionally drifts into elevated register beyond Elara's established voice ("The inscription had shifted as well"), and syntactic variety is limited with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm in descriptive passages. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance story or atmosphere. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("Her motivation was singular: to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" repeats the prompt element without adding pressure). Template cadence in "Elara began to work... She understood... She realized" sequence. The phrase "gently meticulous" appears three times unchanged, suggesting synonym difficulty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of a library preserving vows as lantern slides offers modest freshness, and the transformation of static preservation into active connection provides a meaningful turn. The slide's message changing based on interaction is conceptually interesting. However, the execution relies on familiar tropes (chosen one narrative, magical transformation without cost) and the resolution lacks specificity—we never see what particular vows mean or why they matter beyond abstraction.</comment>
