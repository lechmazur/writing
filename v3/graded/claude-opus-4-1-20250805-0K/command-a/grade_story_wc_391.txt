<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from impatience to patience provides clear motivation that drives the narrative, though the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction in scene. The "sculpting patience from impatience" works as consistent trait-based motivation, but emotional states read more as declared than felt through specific embodied details.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's transformation and the spreading "patient revolution," with visible cost in her deliberate renunciation of urgency. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as moon observations and viaduct encounters build toward change, though the transformation mechanism ("understanding" atop the viaduct) lacks concrete dramatization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake create atmospheric setting that frames the narrative, with the viaduct serving as a focal point for transformation. Sensory details like "air crackled with restrained wildness" and "silver light upon the frozen lake" establish mood, though the setting could more directly constrain choices beyond providing meditation space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of achieving patience through moon-tracking methodology remains consistent, with one meaningful deepening when Elara realizes the viaduct represents needed connections. Cost appears in her renunciation of urgency, though the escalation relies on internal realization rather than external pressure testing her commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The patience/impatience theme emerges organically through Elara's actions and the gradual transformation of visitors, avoiding explicit moralizing. The viaduct-as-connection metaphor and moon-path tracking create thematic coherence, though the "patient revolution" concept trends toward abstraction rather than embodied particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and purposeful rhythm in phrases like "softly purposeful." Voice occasionally drifts into elevated register ("testament to the connections she had forged") that exceeds the established naturalistic tone, but perceptual signature remains distinct in moon observations.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Prose suffers from abstract phrasing ("restrained wildness," "unyoke the chaos") and conceptual redundancy, particularly in explaining the viaduct's significance multiple times. Template cadence appears in "She began to..." constructions, and several paragraphs could be cut without losing story knowledge, though the writing avoids major clarity issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The horizon mapper profession and moon-path tracking method offer modest freshness, but the transformation-through-meditation arc follows familiar templates. The story commits to its patience-revolution premise but doesn't transform the concept through specific lived detail that would distinguish it from similar spiritual journey narratives.</comment>
