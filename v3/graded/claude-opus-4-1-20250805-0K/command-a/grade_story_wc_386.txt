I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through layered dream fragments and symbolic resonance rather than strict causality.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "salvage something pure from the wreckage" drives concrete actions through dream analysis, and her method of "weaving truth carefully" manifests in specific note-taking and whispered names. However, the character lacks internal contradiction or struggle during her discovery process—she moves through revelations without embodied resistance or cost, making the emotional progression feel predetermined rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the globe clears to reveal the untouched village, reweighting the family's story from loss to preservation. The accumulative structure through dream fragments coheres well, building toward Elara's promise to "keep their story alive." However, the cost remains primarily conceptual—while the family's tragedy is clear, Elara pays no visible price for her connection, limiting the closure's full impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Arctic shrine carved into glacier ice functions as more than setting—its "crystalline walls" and "borrowed starlight" create a liminal space where boundaries blur, directly enabling Elara's ghost-whispering work. The melted snow globe's physical transformation from frozen to "murky liquid" mirrors the story's thematic movement from obscured to revealed truth, with tactile details like "cracked glass" grounding the mystical elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the snow globe's story—develops through accumulating dream visions that progressively reveal the family's tragedy. The escalation from child's laughter to mother's tears to final revelation follows the textural lens appropriately. However, Elara encounters no resistance or complication; the visions arrive without struggle, and she faces no difficult choices about whether to continue or what to do with the knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of salvaging meaning from wreckage emerges organically through the snow globe's physical state—"melted and distort over time, its beauty warped but not erased"—which mirrors how stories survive catastrophe. The final clearing of the globe's murky liquid offers a non-literal answer about preservation through witness, though the resolution feels slightly neat given the complexity of the loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains an appropriately mystical register with phrases like "tapestry woven from fragments" and "window of connection," fitting Elara's ghost-whisperer role. However, the prose occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("hushed stillness...world seemed to hold its breath") without earning the elevation through specific perception, and lacks the distinct perceptual signature that would fully embody Elara's unique way of seeing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Several passages suffer from redundancy, particularly "The shrine was a place of borrowed starlight, where the boundary between the living and the dead blurred like the edges of a dream" followed immediately by similar mystical description. Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("her heart quickened," "eyes snapped open," "tremor in her chest"), and the metaphor density in the opening creates opacity without advancing story pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept of accessing truth through "cameo appearances in strangers' dreams" offers a fresh angle on ghost communication, avoiding typical séance tropes. The specific detail of the baker who "had never seen the ocean" dreaming of a ship deck adds authentic strangeness. However, the execution plays safely within the ghost-whisperer genre without taking risks that might heighten the stakes or complicate Elara's method.</comment>
