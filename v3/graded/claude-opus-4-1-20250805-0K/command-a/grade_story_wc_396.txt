<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with her shadow-laced peacekeeper identity driving choices throughout. The internal journey from fragmented understanding to unified purpose works, though the transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than struggled for. Her calm intuitive nature guides without sufficient internal contradiction or cost during the mirror revelations.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the crystal ball's reconstitution and the lighthouse beacon's activation, with visible cost in Elara's merging with the anomaly's courage. The accumulative/textural lens holds as mirror glimpses build toward the final synthesis. However, the mechanics of fragment gathering feel convenient—hidden pieces rising "from their corners" by "unseen force" undermines earned causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above ice floes creates a vivid, unique setting that frames the story's tension between isolation and connection. The vintage store's mirrors function as active setting elements that constrain and enable Elara's quest. Minor deduction for the orchard being "precariously perched" without this precariousness affecting any choices or creating pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—bridging fractured souls through empathy—is signaled early and maintains focus. Each mirror revelation deepens understanding, though these accumulate without true resistance or complication. The final reconstitution carries weight but arrives through magical convenience rather than earned struggle, limiting the sense of genuine escalation under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of mapping empathy onto action emerges organically through the mirror visions and crystallizes in the final beacon image. The warrior fighting "not for victory but for understanding" effectively embodies the thematic question. However, the resolution tends toward the overtly symbolic with the crystal ball as "beacon of unity" spreading light "across the world."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency with appropriate distance for Elara's contemplative nature. Phrases like "shadow-laced peacekeeper" and "weighted breath before reply" create distinctive texture. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("reconstitute the crystal ball, not just physically but symbolically") that feels more authorial than character-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and some evocative imagery. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("mapping empathy onto action"), repetitive constructions ("She saw...She moved...She needed"), and overreliance on telling ("The process was not easy"). The final paragraph's sweeping abstractions ("a reminder that empathy, when mapped onto action, could mend even the deepest fractures") replace scene pressure with theme summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of mirrors revealing past moments rather than reflections offers a fresh angle on the quest narrative. The shadow-laced peacekeeper identity and lighthouse orchard setting create distinctive atmosphere. However, the resolution mechanism—fragments magnetically assembling themselves—feels templated, and the warrior anomaly visions lack surprising specificity.</comment>
