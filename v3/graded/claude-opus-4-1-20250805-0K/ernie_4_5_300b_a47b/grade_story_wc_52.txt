I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - The story builds through layered imagery and reflection toward a resonant reconfiguration where Clara transforms grief into creation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is grounded in specific grief and the tangible act of carving. The internal contradiction between holding on and letting go plays out through concrete action. However, the "lion tamer's widow" identity feels more like a label than lived experience - we never see how this specific loss differs from any other widowhood.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Clara's carved lion becoming a vessel for transformation. The accumulative lens holds as density increases toward the final image of "carving the void into something that could hold the light." Cost is visible in the months of avoidance and the acceptance that loss is transformation, not ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The loft setting provides atmospheric coherence with its "rust-hued peace" and rain-streaked glass. The ash wood blank constrains and enables Clara's choice to process grief through creation. Yet the setting could be any artist's studio - nothing uniquely ties this space to the widow's specific loss.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake - transforming grief into something tangible - deepens through the carving process. The tightening occurs as Clara moves from avoidance to tentative cuts to completed lion. However, there's minimal resistance or complication; the carving proceeds too smoothly without struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of carving void into form. The concept of "here and gone" resonates through multiple registers without explicit moralizing. The final insight that "even in absence, there was shape" reweights the entire piece effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent close-third with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature shows in details like "threads that blurred the city's skyline into a watercolor haze." Some phrases drift toward writerly abstraction ("crystallized time," "harvest lessons") that feel imposed rather than character-authentic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor issues include occasional overwriting ("the color of dried blood and autumn leaves") and one instance of telling what's shown ("Clara smiled...and thought").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The widow-processing-grief-through-art premise is well-worn territory. The specific transformation through wood carving offers some freshness, and the "crystallized time" concept provides a non-obvious angle. However, the emotional arc follows predictable beats without surprising inflection.</comment>
