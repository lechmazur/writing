<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's progression from doubt to clarity is earned through concrete discovery, with contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. curiosity) acting simultaneously. The final choice to become a conduit shows visible cost through physical transformation ("vibration beneath his skin"). However, internal conflict could be more embodied during the middle beats, relying too heavily on abstract processing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and symbolic objects build toward Kael's transformation into a universal conduit. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael accepting his role with the universe "answering" through him. Cost is visible in the irreversible transformation, though the stakes could be sharpened earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ambered observatory functions as more than setting—its crystalline walls "preserving final moments" constrains Kael's choices to this specific space and time. The coins become active tools that unlock understanding. The final image of Kael raising hands in the amber glow charges the space with transformation, making environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: static bursts → fractured timelines → coherent vision → wavelength alignment. The dominant stake (deciphering the prophecy before contraction completes) tightens as understanding deepens. However, the pressure lacks a concrete deadline or visible consequence for failure until the final beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of wavelength alignment—moving from noise to signal, chaos to coherence. The coins' transformation from dead artifacts to living circuit embodies this without stating it. The ending reweights the prophecy from warning to mirror, though some philosophical passages ("desire to harmonize") edge toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature: Kael experiences the cosmos through tactile interaction with coins and console, not visual sweep. Voice maintains consistency through technical-mystical register appropriate to the character. Minor slip: "quietly enthusiastic" appears twice verbatim, suggesting template insertion rather than organic variation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs ("fingers traced the grooves"—physical action + emotional state + world-building). Strong rhythm variation supports the accumulative structure. Deductions for repetitive constructions ("Kael + verb" pattern in paragraphs 2-3) and the phrase "quietly enthusiastic" appearing twice identically.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of entropy cosmology with human agency—the universe seeking consciousness to guide its rebirth. The backwards prophecy concept genuinely transforms the chosen-one trope. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure pays off, though some elements (coins from dead worlds) echo familiar SF imagery.</comment>
