<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her contemplative nature fits the glazier profession, with concrete embodied details like "hands, calloused from years" and physical sensations in the water. The internal journey from seeking to finding illumination in the mundane is earned through specific experience with the prism and ripples. However, the transformation lacks visible cost—she finds peace without sacrificing anything tangible, and no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's crystallized understanding that "illumination was not about grand revelations, but about the quiet moments," with the prism atrium serving as both literal and metaphorical lens. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward this reweighting of perspective. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than felt—no path is foreclosed, no opportunity lost, just a gentle affirmation of existing beliefs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting functions beyond decoration: the misty atrium creates a natural "prismatic chamber" that enables Elara's contemplation, while specific details like "Harbor glazier," "Pearl Bay," and lighthouse glass repair ground the world. The interplay of light, water, and mist constrains her method of seeking clarity through the ripples. Minor deduction for some generic dawn imagery ("horizon bled gold and violet") that could describe any sunrise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding value in the mundane—is signaled early and maintained throughout, with the stone-throwing creating a minor deepening as patterns emerge. However, escalation is minimal; there's no tightening of options or meaningful pressure that forces choice. The resolution arrives through contemplation rather than earned struggle, lacking the visible price or foreclosed path that would elevate the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the prism metaphor and Elara's profession of "reading between lines" in glass, avoiding explicit moralizing until the notebook entry. The concept of finding extraordinary potential in ordinary things develops through concrete images—ripples, fractured light, rainbows in fog. The final paragraph's "clear complexity" and explicit theme statement ("illumination was not about grand revelations") costs 0.5 for directness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent contemplative register appropriate to Elara's reflective nature, with perceptual signature evident in how she notices light patterns and glass-like qualities in water. Prose rhythm modulates effectively between longer descriptive passages and shorter sensory moments. Some filter verb clusters ("she believed," "she thought," "she felt") slightly dull immediacy in middle sections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variation and strong sensory specificity ("cold biting her ankles," "breath visible in the mist"). Information density is moderate—most sentences advance atmosphere or character state. Deductions for repetitive "She [verb]" openings across five consecutive paragraphs mid-story (-0.4) and some redundancy between "illuminate value in the mundane" stated twice with minimal variation (-0.2).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The glazier profession reading light through glass offers a moderately fresh angle on perception metaphors, and the prism atrium as natural phenomenon shows some invention. However, the core concept—finding beauty in ordinary moments through careful observation—follows a well-worn contemplative template without significant transformation. The resolution into peaceful acceptance represents the safety middle, avoiding risk or complication.</comment>
