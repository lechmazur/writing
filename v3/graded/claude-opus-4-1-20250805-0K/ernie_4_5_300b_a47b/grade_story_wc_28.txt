<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and his internal conflict between gentleness and radical action manifests through concrete choices, particularly in the symbolic act of placing the tessera. The retrocognitive episodes effectively embody his emotional state and create genuine tension. However, the character transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than discovered through struggle, and the "aberrant mercy" mantra borders on diagnostic self-awareness that weakens authenticity in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's symbolic act of placing the tessera, with visible cost in the destroyed city and implied emotional weight. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and retrocognitive episodes build toward the final image of promise. However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—we see aftermath but not the price Elias personally pays for his stance, weakening the closure's impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shattered sky and ruined plaza create vivid atmosphere through selective sensory detail, particularly the "air tasted of ash and ozone" and the fractured glass stars. The tessera functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image effectively. Setting details mirror internal states without overt symbolism, though some descriptions edge toward the ornamental rather than actively pressuring choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rebuilding meaning from destruction—is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation or tightening. Elias's placement of the tessera represents agency through symbolic action, but no opposing force or internal resistance creates genuine conflict. The story presents aftermath without active pressure, making the resolution feel predetermined rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tessera's journey from creation to destruction to renewal, avoiding explicit moralizing. The concept of "aberrant mercy" integrates with concrete action, and the final image of the single tessera holding "the promise of tomorrow" resonates without stating a moral. However, phrases like "erasure was not destruction. It was transformation" edge toward thematic summary rather than earned insight through dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, particularly in passages like "vendors laughing, children chasing pigeons." The retrocognitive shifts are handled cleanly without confusion. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from Elias's established voice ("testament to the aberrant mercy that had become his creed"), and some constructions feel written rather than perceived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence variety and rhythm generally support the contemplative tone, with effective variation in length and structure. Information density is moderate, with most lines advancing atmosphere or character state. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("He had renamed the world, one chipped stone at a time" restates the prior paragraph's content), and phrases like "warm coldness" and "gentle radical" feel forced rather than organic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The retrocognitive trap offers a fresh angle on post-disaster narrative, avoiding simple reconstruction plots. The synthesis of destruction and creation through the tessera metaphor shows originality. However, the "gentle radical" archetype and the symbolic mosaic restoration feel somewhat familiar from literary fiction templates, lacking the specific transformation that would elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>
