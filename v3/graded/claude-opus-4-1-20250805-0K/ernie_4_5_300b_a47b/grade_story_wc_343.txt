I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens**: Causal - the story follows a clear because/therefore chain from curiosity to discovery to transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's curiosity drives consistent choices through discovery, though her leap feels slightly undermotivated despite the setup. The transformation from apprentice to discoverer lands with some cost ("You're mad," but grinning acceptance). Internal conflict between following orders and pursuing discovery plays out in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Decisive Change (Lira charts "not just a place, but a truth") with visible transformation. The causal chain from hopscotch discovery to portal leap holds, though the "stranded luminance" mechanics remain vague. Cost is implied through risk ("You're not seriously going out there?") but could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The airship setting constrains choices effectively - Lira must work in secret, the cargo hold provides discovery space, and the ship's edge enables the leap. Starling murmurations guide navigation meaningfully. Sensory detail ("copper hull creaking like a sigh") serves atmosphere without overwhelming.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from mapping floors to discovering cosmic truth, with the leap as decisive risk. Pressure builds through Jax's discovery, captain's orders, and the narrowing window ("The gap between them widened"). Cost could be more tangible - we see risk but not price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity-as-compass emerges through action, culminating in "not just a place, but a truth." The stranded luminance metaphor for hidden knowledge works without overstatement. Subtext operates well in Jax's shift from skepticism to complicity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent apprentice perspective with appropriate lexicon ("ink-stained fingers," "mind that hummed"). Dialogue differentiates characters effectively - Jax's gruffness versus Lira's precision. The narrative stance holds through the fantastical leap without breaking POV bounds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and strong momentum. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor repetition in "starlings screamed" but serves pattern. The final image lands with resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hopscotch-as-star-map concept offers genuine freshness, transforming a children's game into cosmic navigation. The synthesis of antique airship and portal discovery feels earned. Risk-taking in the leap sequence heightens stakes while maintaining coherence.</comment>
