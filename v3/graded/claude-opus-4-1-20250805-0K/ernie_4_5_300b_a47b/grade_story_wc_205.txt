<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation burns consistently through archaeological obsession replacing revolutionary fervor, with his plan to cover mirrors embodying both poetic logic and desperate ingenuity. The fungal revelation creates genuine discovery under pressure. However, internal contradiction could be more embodied during peak moments rather than summarized ("his voice burnished with sorrow").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the mirror-covering accumulating toward fungal revelation that reweights the Luminari myth. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "planted a seed of doubt, a fungus of revolution" with visible cost in Kael's transformation from revolutionary to archaeologist. The vase shard's evolution from destruction to promise anchors the reconfiguration effectively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid with "time visible as cobalt haze" and temporal storms creates distinctive atmosphere that constrains Kael's tactics (covering mirrors to stabilize timelines). The bioluminescent fungi beneath the crust provides crucial counter-history. Setting actively shapes the archaeological dispute and enables the final revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on proving Luminari fraudulence versus Council's myth-making, with escalation through mirror-covering during temporal storm to fungal bloom revelation. The cost is visible in Kael's heretic status and the societal upheaval beginning. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the Council's opposition could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly through the mirror metaphor—obscuring distorted reflections to reveal unpolished truth. The fungi as living archive versus Luminari's erased histories creates resonant contrast. Final image of the shard as "promise: to reimagine, to remember, to grow" reweights the entire archaeological pursuit without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinctive voice with baroque register matching the asteroid setting ("burnished sorrow," "palimpsest of erased voices"). POV remains stable with Kael's archaeological-poetic perception filtering everything. Some moments edge toward overwriting but generally the elevated diction serves the story's ambitions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("time had only recently become visible as a shimmering cobalt haze") but occasionally tips into purple territory. Some metaphor density in non-peak beats ("burnished with sorrow," "seed of doubt, a fungus of revolution") without clear pattern-teaching. Information density generally high with purposeful imagery.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The temporal storms as windows to alternate timelines and mirrors as conduits offers fresh inflection on archaeological discovery. The bioluminescent fungi as DNA-encoded history beneath imperial architecture transforms the "lost civilization" trope. Kael as "defunct revolutionary turned poetically inclined archaeologist" creates memorable specificity.</comment>
