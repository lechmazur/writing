<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's contradictory impulses—professional detachment versus personal ache—act simultaneously through her translation choices ("He loved the silence between waves"). The final choice to bring coral to negotiations is earned through prior causality, though the general's response feels slightly convenient. Strong embodied emotion through the "lotus-hearted ache" and concrete micro-choices reveal values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira's act crystallizes hope from fragments. Cost is visible in the "lotus-hearted ache" and the coral's sharp edges as metaphor for difficult peace. The closure lands with felt weight, though the general's receptiveness arrives somewhat easily.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The coral fragment and cast function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image effectively. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("mist curled around...like ghost's fingers"). The atrium setting provides atmosphere but could pressure choices more directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridging impossible gaps) signals early and deepens through the child's cast translations. The coral placement at negotiations represents meaningful escalation under the textural lens. Cost is legible but the resolution's ease slightly undermines the established difficulty of peace talks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the coral/cast mirror—both holding "fragments of loss" yearning for regrowth. The ending offers a non-literal answer through "sharp things can carve new paths" without moralizing. Subtext operates effectively in Lira's translations that transform anxiety into hope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through Lira's translator lens shapes what she notices ("frayed words into bridges"). Voice modulates appropriately with emotional intensity. Minor register elevation in "lotus-hearted ache" fits the lyrical mode but occasionally distances from immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction ("atrium's twilight," "alchemy") occasionally slows momentum. Clear propulsion through varied sentence structures, though a few abstract phrases ("bridges gaps," "frayed metaphors") could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The translator-as-alchemist angle offers fresh perspective on conflict resolution. "Lotus-hearted ache" as coined term for grief/tenderness creates memorable specificity. The coral-as-peace-catalyst feels slightly convenient but the emotional truth of fragments becoming wholes resonates authentically.</comment>
