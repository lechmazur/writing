I'll evaluate this story through the lens of an Accumulative/Textural drive, as the piece builds through pattern, repetition, and density toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mara's connection to lost routes transforms from absence to presence.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—building the antenna with hair, scrap metal, and the censer foot. Her internal conflict between loss and hope manifests in physical labor and tears. The "patchwork navigator" identity effectively merges role with character, though some emotional beats rely on abstract declarations ("geography of loss") rather than embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the reverse migration succeeds—lost routes return through the antenna's signal, transforming absence into presence with clear emotional cost (tears, trembling). The accumulative structure coheres through the moon's phases, midnight calls, and building sequences. Minor deduction for some causality softness around how exactly the censer foot's weight fluctuations enable navigation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The signal station setting actively constrains choices through its broken hydraulics and limited materials, forcing Mara to improvise. Strong sensory work with "salt air," "burning insulation," and the ocean's roar. The censer foot functions as micro-setting that directly shapes the final antenna construction, though some spatial choreography remains vague during the building sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating midnight calls that provide cryptic instructions, each deepening Mara's commitment and physical investment. The cost is visible in her exhaustion ("sweat dripping") and emotional release. The moon's fluctuating influence on the censer foot creates natural pressure that tightens toward the noon climax when signals finally return.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concept of reverse migration—not just navigating forward but recovering what's lost. The grandmother's voice bridging past and present creates resonance without explicit moralizing. The final image of "the lost were waiting" reweights the entire journey from solitary labor to communal reconnection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with evocative phrases like "skeletal fingers" and "moon's breath," though some sections drift toward overwrought metaphor ("geography of loss"). The cryptic phone dialogue effectively uses indirection and subtext. Minor register drift in places where poetic diction overwhelms the character's practical navigator identity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic control, particularly in the building sequence. Some overwriting appears in metaphorical density ("tide dragging pebbles," "silver sliver") that occasionally obscures clarity. The repeated "geography of loss" phrase borders on becoming a loop, and filter constructions ("she felt," "she knew") occasionally dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fusion of technological decay with ancestral wisdom offers fresh perspective on connection and loss. The censer foot as navigation tool tied to lunar cycles provides original specificity. The midnight phone calls from the static-preserved grandmother voice transforms the ghost story trope through concrete technical details.</comment>
