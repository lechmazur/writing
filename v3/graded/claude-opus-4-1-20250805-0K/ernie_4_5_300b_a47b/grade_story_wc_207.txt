<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's obsessive collecting and psychometry abilities create genuine internal tension between scientific curiosity and confronting the unknowable, with her final hunger for more mysteries showing earned character evolution. The "sensibly eccentric" trait drives actual choices rather than existing as a label, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("she understood now").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with petrichor samples building toward the lagoon's ancient sentience, culminating in Lira's acceptance of unknowability as she labels her final jars—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (the expedition's fate). The compass's progression from discovery to guide to "talisman" creates coherent pressure, though the expedition's disappearance explanation feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lagoon's "resonant hush" and gravity-defying water constrain Lira's understanding and force her confrontation with limits of knowledge. Sensory details like "air thick with petrichor, richer than any she'd ever collected" and the tactile compass vibration ground the supernatural elements effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from collecting curiosity through the compass's intensifying behavior to the lagoon's indifferent presence, with Lira's realization that "human logic didn't apply" forcing her retreat. The cost—accepting mysteries must stay unsolved—lands clearly, though the expedition's fate resolution feels slightly deflated by explanation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of knowledge's limits emerges organically through Lira's collecting obsession meeting the lagoon's incomprehensibility, with the final image of her hunger for more mysteries resonating without moralizing. "The place where explanations fail" drives the entire arc without becoming abstract philosophy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinctive voice through specialized vocabulary ("petrichor collector," "psychometry reading") and Lira's particular way of perceiving ("hinged awakenings"), maintaining consistency through pressure. Some filter phrases ("Lira felt," "she realized") slightly dull immediacy in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative phrases like "shadows stretching like ancient fingers," though several filter-verb clusters appear in high-pressure beats ("Lira felt a prickle," "she felt the expedition's fear"). Some explanatory redundancy in the lagoon discovery sequence slightly slows momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The petrichor collector premise offers fresh specificity, and the intersection of scientific collecting with supernatural threshold creates non-obvious synthesis. The lagoon as a place where "human logic didn't apply" transforms the lost expedition trope effectively, though the resolution edges toward expected territory.</comment>
