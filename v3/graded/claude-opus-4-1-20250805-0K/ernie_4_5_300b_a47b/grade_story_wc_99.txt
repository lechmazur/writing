I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** This is a Causal lens story - events follow because/therefore linkage as Yorick's lace-weaving instructions enable Lira to reconcile with her father's ghost.

<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters are well-motivated with clear desires - Lira seeking closure about her father, Yorick as patient guide. The reconciliation feels earned through the lace-weaving ritual. Minor deduction for the ghost's too-convenient appearance and immediate resolution without more complex emotional friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands clearly as a Decisive Change - father and daughter reconcile, transforming their relationship from severance to peace. The causal chain from compass to lace to reconciliation holds. Deduction for the somewhat mechanical resolution where the lace-weaving immediately solves the central conflict without complications.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric setting with the islet, post-rain dampness, and bonsai studio creating a contemplative space. The lace becomes micro-setting that constrains choice through its specific stitches. The shipwreck and translucent ghost effectively merge setting with emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake - finding what the father "never said" - drives the action and resolves with visible emotional cost. However, escalation is limited; once the lace-weaving begins, the path to resolution is straightforward without meaningful reversals or complications that would deepen pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lace metaphor - acknowledgment, admission, forgiveness as stitches that bind relationships. The final image of hearts at peace resonates without moralizing. Slight deduction for the somewhat neat thematic resolution that doesn't embrace fuller complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Yorick's voice is distinctive - "slow and deliberate as the drip of melting snow" - with controlled, contemplative diction. Dialogue carries subtext effectively. Minor issues with occasional purple prose ("bruise of cerulean") and some filter verbs that could be stronger.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good rhythm. Some overwriting in metaphors ("bruise of cerulean," "translucent as sea foam") and occasional redundancy. The lace-as-language conceit occasionally strains clarity but mostly works.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lace-as-emotional-map concept offers fresh perspective on grief and reconciliation. The specific stitching instructions tied to emotional states show originality. However, the ghost reconciliation plot itself follows familiar patterns without major transformation.</comment>
