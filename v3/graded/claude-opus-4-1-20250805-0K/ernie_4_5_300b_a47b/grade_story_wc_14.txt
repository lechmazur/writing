<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Althea's motivation to "collect textures of different times" remains abstract throughout; her internal state during the lamp's pulsing moment lacks embodied contradiction beyond trembling hands. The character functions more as a vessel for lyrical description than a person facing genuine internal conflict with stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story lacks a decisive change or meaningful reconfiguration—Althea simply continues her routine of dawn writing sessions. No visible cost manifests from her actions; the ending declaration that she "persisted" offers continuity rather than closure. The Accumulative/Textural lens could apply but no density shift or pattern break reweights the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth and its "miniature worlds" create vivid atmosphere with sensory precision—the "mineral-rich soil" affecting leaf shimmer, the moss-cushioned stones. The fluorescent lamp becomes a constraining tool that shapes Althea's method, though its specific properties could drive more concrete choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation occurs—the lamp pulsing represents the story's only pressure point, but it resolves without consequence or cost. Althea experiences no opposition to her collecting, no trade-offs in her choices. The story maintains stasis rather than building toward any decisive moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of preserving "invented histories" emerges through Althea's actions but remains unexplored in its implications. The final paragraph's explicit moralizing about her role as "guardian of memories" and "weaver of tales" replaces earned resonance with direct statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the contemplative tone, with controlled rhythm in passages like "each page a portal to a time that never was but could have been." However, the narrative voice lacks distinctive perceptual signature—Althea notices things generically rather than through her specific stationer's lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing patterns emerge ("She was here to...", "Althea was not just...") and abstract descriptors proliferate ("quiet energy," "magical glow"). The prose achieves moments of precision but relies heavily on telling through labels like "earnestly studious" and "incandescent restraint" rather than embodied demonstration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The concept of a stationer documenting fictional histories offers mild novelty, but execution remains safely literary without risk. The story follows predictable artistic-observer templates without transforming them through specific lived detail or unexpected moral calculus.</comment>
