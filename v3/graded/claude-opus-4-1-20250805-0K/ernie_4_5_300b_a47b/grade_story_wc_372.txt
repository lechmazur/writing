<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her meticulous nature drives concrete actions (sampling frequencies, matching pitches), but her emotional progression feels somewhat linear—frustration to determination to satisfaction—without the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the score. The final moment of exhaustion melting away lacks the visible cost that her dedication should exact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with frequency sampling building toward restoration, and achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration as the library's magic brightens. However, the cost remains abstract—"exhaustion melting away" contradicts rather than confirms sacrifice, and the resolution feels too neat given the established stakes of the library potentially crumbling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frozen library setting is vividly rendered with selective details (frost on glass panes, sagging shelves, ice prism) that reflect Elara's precise perspective. The environment actively constrains her work through fading illusions and provides tools (lantern, prism, tuning fork) that shape her tactics, though it could pressure choices more forcefully.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—saving the library's knowledge—is signaled early and pressure escalates through fading vows and time constraints ("Not yet"). However, the resolution arrives too easily after one successful reconstruction, without the meaningful tightening or foreclosed option that would demonstrate real cost under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of preserving meaning against entropy emerges organically through Elara's work with luminous vows, and the specific image of reconstructing promises "piece by piece" resonates. Yet the ending's sudden success undercuts complexity—the theme would strengthen if partial failure or irretrievable loss complicated the resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent, controlled voice with distinctive perceptual signature ("quartz hush," "bleaching like old ink") that reflects Elara's orderly precision. Focalization remains stable throughout, and the narrative modulates effectively between technical description and emotional beats, though some filter phrases ("Elara frowned," "Elara smiled") slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in technical passages about frequency sampling. Some repetitive constructions appear ("Elara's motivation was clear," "Elara's gently meticulous nature") and the phrase "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" repeats verbatim, creating minor loops that prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The concept of reconstructing vows through light frequencies offers a fresh angle on memory preservation, and the specific method of matching frequencies to colors shows originality. However, the resolution follows predictable beats without transformation—the story could work unchanged in many magical library settings, limiting its distinctiveness.</comment>
