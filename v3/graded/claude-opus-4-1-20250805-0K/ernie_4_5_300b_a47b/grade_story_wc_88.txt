<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between lost identity and emerging empathy works well. The final choice to embrace understanding over erasure feels earned through the lake's revelations. However, J.T.'s characterization remains thin beyond her function as guide, and some emotional transitions happen too smoothly without sufficient friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's shift from seeking erasure to embracing understanding, with visible cost in accepting the weight of her past. The accumulative/textural lens holds as memories and reflections build toward the final reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early, and the baseball-to-lake-to-revelation causality tracks, though the time-travel element strains credibility without sufficient grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake functions brilliantly as both literal setting and metaphorical space where choices manifest visually. Sensory details like "moss that pulsed faintly blue" and "liquid light where bioluminescent algae swirled like drowned stars" create vivid atmosphere. The underground descent and water imagery constrain movement and force Mara's confrontation with her past.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering empathy after neural reset—is clear, and pressure builds through the descent and lake immersion. The revelation of alternate lives provides meaningful deepening that changes Mara's understanding. However, J.T.'s appearance lacks sufficient resistance, and the resolution comes too easily without forcing harder choices or visible struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The labyrinth-as-choices theme emerges organically through the lake's reflections of paths not taken. The baseball as compass and the final image of Mara carrying it as "a secret between her and the dark" resonates without overstatement. Some thematic articulation by J.T. ("That's what empathy is—holding the pain of others") edges toward explicit but remains grounded in scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency with phrases like "fragments of guilt that surfaced like ink in water" showing Mara's fragmented state. Dialogue between Mara and J.T. carries appropriate weight though J.T.'s voice ("a rustle of autumn leaves") relies on stock description. The POV stays controlled without head-hopping, though some filter phrases could be cut.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments like "liquid light where bioluminescent algae swirled like drowned stars" but suffers from repetitive structures and some overwriting. Filter verbs appear frequently ("she realized," "she felt"), and phrases like "delicately robust woman" feel forced. The final paragraph's momentum is good, but earlier sections have density issues with near-duplicate concepts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The bioluminescent lake of regret offers a fresh take on memory exploration, and the image of alternate lives as reflections in glowing water is compelling. The time-traveler element feels less integrated and more convenient. The synthesis of neural reset, corporate spy past, and empathy recovery shows originality but doesn't fully escape familiar redemption arc patterns.</comment>
