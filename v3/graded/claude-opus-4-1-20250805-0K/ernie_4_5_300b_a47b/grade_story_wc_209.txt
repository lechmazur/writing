I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the strict rubric for a 600-800 word piece.

**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered discoveries and pattern recognition, with density increase toward the final revelation about communion rather than defiance.

<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's obsession with her grandmother's cryptic legacy drives consistent motivation throughout. The internal contradiction between her public art and private quest creates genuine tension. However, the revelation lacks full embodied cost - we see intellectual understanding but limited emotional price for this knowledge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres well as Mara decodes the window's layers across seasons, building to the resonant reconfiguration of understanding flowers' nocturnal blooming. The closure lands conceptually but the cost remains more intellectual than felt - "Mara smiled" suggests satisfaction without visible sacrifice or foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cathedral window's etched glass constrains and enables Mara's quest beautifully - its shifting patterns in different lights reveal progressive truths. The amber pavilion and seasonal transitions support the temporal arc. Setting actively shapes discovery through the window's physical properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes build through Mara's deepening obsession and the window's progressive revelations, but escalation plateaus after finding the violet glass inscription. The final understanding arrives without sufficient pressure or trade-off - the "communion" insight lacks dramatized opposition or cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of hidden knowledge and "reckoning with the hush" emerges organically through Mara's discoveries. The final insight about communion versus defiance reweights the entire quest meaningfully. The recurring motif of darkness nourishing what light scorches creates genuine thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled metaphorical density ("amber pavilion," "fiery confetti," "umbral tenderness"). The perceptual signature of an artist noticing light patterns and visual details remains strong. Minor register elevation in places ("liminal space between night and day") but largely coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high without overwriting. Some mild template patterns in the middle section ("She noticed how," "Mara found," "She'd started") but momentum remains strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of botanical mystery with stained glass artistry offers fresh angle on the discovery narrative. The specific detail about nocturnal flora "outracing the sun's tyranny" and the window as "map to the hush" creates memorable particularity. The reversal that flowers bloom in communion rather than defiance provides genuine insight.</comment>
