<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation to prove time moves sideways drives clear choices, particularly in the crisis recalibration sequence. The "obliging" trait manifests through competent action rather than deeper characterization. Internal conflict remains minimal—she experiences tension but no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: nexus activation causes flora awakening, overcompensation causes destabilization, recalibration restores control. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Veyra reaching for the lever again with newfound drive—though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The director's "we're not done yet" crystallizes future stakes without a decisive change occurring on-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The nexus and its holographic grids constrain Veyra's choices during the crisis, forcing specific recalibration moves. Sensory details like "metallic joints clicking" and "blue light cascade" are selective and purposeful. The station's "icy warmth" paradox charges the final image when it "seeps into her bones."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from calibration to crisis when the nexus destabilizes, forcing urgent recalibration. The tightening narrows options—Veyra must act immediately or lose control—but resolution comes too easily through technical adjustment. Cost remains abstract ("glimpse the unseen") rather than showing what Veyra sacrifices or risks beyond momentary danger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of bending reality/time emerges through the nexus's function and the "subdued awakenings" of flora. The director's "time moves sideways" gains resonance through demonstrated magnetic manipulation. However, the ending smile and reach for the lever don't offer a non-literal answer to the central question—instead suggesting simple continuation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Technical vocabulary ("magnetic nexus," "holographic grids," "secondary coils") maintains consistency with Veyra's mechanic expertise. Brief dialogue from LUX and the director serves functional purposes. POV remains stable, though perceptual signature could be more distinct—Veyra notices equipment but her unique way of seeing doesn't fully emerge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose maintains clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures. Information density is solid—most lines advance plot or atmosphere. Minor redundancy appears in "subdued awakenings" explanation and some filter constructions ("Veyra watched," "Veyra thought"), but these don't touch closure or create loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The xenobiology station above ammonia clouds offers a fresh setting, and "subdued awakenings" as electromagnetic flora response shows creativity. However, the crisis-recalibration-success arc follows familiar patterns. The magnetic field manipulation concept doesn't transform into something unexpected—it functions exactly as explained.</comment>
