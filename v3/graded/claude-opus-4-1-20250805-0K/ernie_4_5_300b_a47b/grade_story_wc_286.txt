I'll evaluate this story through the lens of Accumulative/Textural design, as the piece builds through layered imagery and pattern recognition rather than strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's zen-minded potter identity manifests through her methodical approach and "mind like still water," with clear motivation driving exploration. The vision sequence effectively embodies contradictory impulses—her younger self's fierce well-digging versus current contemplative stance. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient self-recognition in shadows.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara carries the oasis's lesson forward, with cost visible in the fractured timelines she witnesses. The accumulative lens holds as patterns build through sun-following, lantern response, and sunflower discovery. Deduction for cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland and beekeeping oasis create immediate contrast, with skeletal hives as tombstones establishing tone. Sunflowers' impossible survival and the lantern glass's phototropic response constrain Mara's method and charge the final understanding. The setting actively shapes her investigation approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from understanding resistance to witnessing fractured timelines, with the sunflowers' endurance forcing Mara's realization about nurturing chosen timelines. The vision sequence provides meaningful deepening rather than reversal. Cost becomes legible in the "stubborn hive of memory" she leaves behind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the sunflowers' phototropism to kindness/hope, avoiding explicit moralizing until the subtle "tend to the light within it" lesson. The fractured timelines concept integrates naturally with preservation versus entropy. Final image of Mara at her wheel with the pulsing lantern resonates without stating conclusions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains zen-potter perspective through phrases like "mind like still water" and methodical observation patterns. Some elevated diction ("scorched wasteland," "skeletal hives") fits the contemplative tone but occasionally drifts toward writerly. The perceptual signature of tracing light patterns is distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("horizon bled orange," "whisper of wind through barbed wire") but suffers from occasional overwriting in the vision sequence. Some template phrasing appears ("Mara realized," "Mara understood"). Information density is generally good with most sentences doing multiple jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The phototropic lantern glass responding to kindness offers a fresh take on post-apocalyptic exploration. Fractured timelines as memory anchors transforms the wasteland resistance trope. The sunflowers as prayer rather than crop shows specific character history, though the resolution feels slightly safe.</comment>
