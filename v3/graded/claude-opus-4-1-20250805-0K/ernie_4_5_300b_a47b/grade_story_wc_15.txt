<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to restore through thread rather than chisel is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied actions (raw fingers, humming to make thread glow). The sleepwalker encounter and final transformation show earned change through accumulating particulars. Minor deduction for the sleepwalker's underutilization and some abstract phrasing ("ghost of hope").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural closure with the labyrinth's restoration as Resonant Reconfiguration—the "hymn" and "promise of what could be remade" reweight all prior weaving with visible cost (empty plates, raw fingers). The overlapping paths cohere into wholeness with clear before/after. Slight deduction for the sleepwalker thread not fully integrating into the closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The labyrinth functions as both setting and constraint, with murals, junction symbols, and the cavernous heart chamber directly shaping Lira's path choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (damp stone scent, iridescent thread glow). The tide pools' transformation from empty to filling charges the final image perfectly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulation—each sewn thread builds toward the labyrinth's restoration, with the twin plates' alignment as the decisive deepening moment. Cost is visible in raw fingers and empty plates. The sleepwalker moment could have added more pressure but the overall accumulative tightening lands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of weaving fragments into wholeness—"carve a path from ruin to reverence" manifests literally in the sewn threads. The final image of filling tide pools offers resonant answer without moralizing. The "hauntingly optimistic" heart and transformation from monument to promise elevate the thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent lyric voice with controlled diction ("exhausted eyes," "nervous system" corridors) and strong perceptual signature in how Lira notices thread luminescence and wall grooves. Some register elevation in places ("residual magic," "silent pact") slightly exceeds the character's established voice. Rhythm modulates effectively with the accumulative structure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good sentence variety and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("ghost of hope," "memories, perhaps"), some abstract phrasing ("devotion through endurance"), and minor redundancy in describing the weaving process.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "overlapping sleepwalking paths" technique and thread-weaving as restoration method offer fresh angles on the labyrinth/quest structure. The synthesis of physical mending with metaphysical restoration through dream-logic feels specific. Some derivative elements (labyrinth setting, quest structure) are transformed but not fully transcended.</comment>
