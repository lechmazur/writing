<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and grounded in her identity as a myth-buster confronting an unsolvable riddle. Her internal conflict between logic and wonder plays out through concrete actions (playing the cello, interpreting the shell) with embodied tension. The final choice to embrace feeling over decoding shows earned transformation, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("gloomy cheerfulness," "bittersweet thrill") rather than fully embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Conceptual Repricing through Lira's realization that the riddle "wasn't meant to be decoded. It was meant to be felt," with visible cost in her abandoning her myth-busting identity. The Accumulative/Textural lens coheres as resonant details (shell, cello, observatory) build toward this reconfiguration. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay regarding the astronomer's relationship to the space.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned observatory functions as more than backdrop—its control panel, frozen dials, and dome constrain and enable Lira's investigation. Sensory details effectively narrow during the cello-playing sequence ("The note echoed, brittle and sad"). The painted shell and half-finished cello serve as micro-settings that directly shape choices and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solving the astronomer's riddle—escalates through Lira's cello experiment, with the shell's vibration and dial movement marking genuine deepening. The cost appears in her abandoning her analytical approach ("For the first time in years, Lira didn't rush to explain them away"). However, the resolution feels slightly abrupt; more resistance before the final acceptance would strengthen the earned quality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between logic and intuition, with the shell and cello serving as concrete vehicles for this abstract question. The final insight about harmony bridging "life and death, logic and wonder" resonates without moralizing. The "gloomy cheerfulness" concept and the astronomer's belief that stars are "out of tune" create thematic texture through specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with controlled shifts in psychic distance, particularly effective when channeling the astronomer's voice in italics. Some register elevation appears in peak moments ("fossilized question," "universal riddle") that slightly exceeds Lira's established lexicon. The perceptual signature of a skeptic encountering wonder comes through, though occasional abstract phrasing ("dismantling legends with logic") weakens immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("dust motes swirled in the slanting light of a dying sun") but suffers from occasional abstraction and mild overwriting. Several metaphors feel strained ("fossilized question," "memory trying to reform"). Information density is generally good, though some passages loop conceptually (the explanation of what the shell does appears multiple times in slightly different forms).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise of a myth-buster using music to solve an astronomical riddle offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of scientific investigation with artistic intuition, embodied in the shell-cello resonance, creates an organic fusion. The specific detail of dials frozen at 11:59 PM and the "ephemeral compass" concept show imaginative particularity, though some elements feel slightly derivative of mystery-investigation templates.</comment>
