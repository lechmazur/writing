<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to rediscover time's texture after clocks fail is clear and drives concrete action. His internal conflict between banker-past and timekeeper-present manifests through specific gestures (adjusting frayed cufflinks) and the carried urn fragment. The final renunciation of numerical time for mosaic-time shows earned change, though some interiority veers toward abstract philosophizing ("timelessness wasn't an absence of time—it was a layering") rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's shift from numerical to textural time-keeping, with clear cost (leaving the urn fragment behind). The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through catalogued objects becoming characters in their own story. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the capsule discovery provides meaningful tightening. Deduction for occasional causality softness—the urn fragment's "suddenly" inscription triggering mercury stillness lacks prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The emerald silo functions as more than backdrop—its moss-streaked walls, metallic tang, and buried capsule constrain Elias's choices and enable his discovery. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (mercury "sloshing lazily, defying gravity"). The silo's shadows that "hold still" while time dissolves elsewhere creates environmental pressure on the central conflict. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("must of forgotten things").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rediscovering time's texture after clocks fail—is signaled early and tightens when Elias discovers the capsule's broken mechanisms require poetic cataloguing rather than repair. The mercury stilling and wife's face appearing provide escalation, though some transitions feel convenience-driven rather than earned through protagonist agency. The final cost (leaving the urn fragment) lands clearly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the contrast between mechanical time (banker's ledgers, clocks) and textural time (objects holding memories). The urn fragment's journey from thrift store to silo bridges grief and wonder without explicit moralizing. The final image of Elias listening at garage sales for other timekeepers' messages offers a non-literal answer to the central question about time's nature.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the concept-driven narrative, with selective perception reflecting Elias's banker-turned-timekeeper lens ("numbers had changed meaning"). The perceptual signature shows in how he reads objects as characters with choreography. Some passages drift toward academic abstraction ("entropy," "syntactic uniformity") that slightly distances from embodied POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("emerald silo stood like a sentinel") but suffers from density issues—abstract concepts pile up without breathing room. Template cadence appears in the cataloguing sequence ("The coil became...The mercury was...The urn fragment?"). Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "timelessness wasn't an absence of time—it was a layering" followed immediately by similar abstraction about the architect's intent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise of time losing syntax while a silo's shadows hold still offers genuine freshness. The synthesis of garage sale cataloguing as time-keeping method shows inventive thinking beyond template responses. The story commits to its conceptual premise without retreat, though some elements (mercury defying gravity) feel added for atmosphere rather than organic necessity.</comment>
