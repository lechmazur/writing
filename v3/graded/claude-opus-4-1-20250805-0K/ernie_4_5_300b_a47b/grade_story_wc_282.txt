I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory layering and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lira transforms from mapper to translator.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's transformation from physical cartographer to emotional translator is earned through concrete interaction with the fossil, though some interiority veers toward abstract ("translator, a bridge between the seen and the unseen"). The fossil dissolution creating physical change (spores entering pores) provides embodied transformation. Internal contradiction between scientific method and mystical openness works well.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Lira becomes "translator" and "voice" with visible transformation (spores merging with her body). The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward this reconfiguration. Cost is present but somewhat abstract - the fossil's dissolution and her physical change carry weight, though the stakes of "awakening the world's memory" remain conceptual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cave setting actively constrains and enables - darkness requires bioluminescent algae, tidal history preserves the fossil, salt air marks transitions. The fossil itself functions as micro-setting that transforms Lira. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("salt-laden air," "damp sand"), filtered through Lira's professional perception as mapper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative deepening: fossil reveals emotional history → projects timeline → floats → dissolves into spores → transforms Lira. Each stage narrows her path from observer to participant. However, the transformation lacks resistance or genuine struggle - Lira accepts each escalation without meaningful internal conflict about the cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of translation between tangible/intangible emerges through concrete action with the fossil rather than assertion. The concept of "transitional objects" as portals gains specificity through the elm leaf's journey. Final image of Lira as bridge/translator resonates, though "the unknown had found its voice" edges toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent blend of scientific precision ("pendant-sized heat-mapper") with lyrical perception ("liminal silence where the ocean's breath replaced"). POV remains stable in close third. Some elevated diction in emotional peaks ("palimpsest of emotions") fits Lira's educated perspective, though occasionally strains naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("The fossil wasn't just ancient; it pulsed with a factually mystical aura") but suffers from abstract scaffolding ("She was no longer just a map maker. She was a translator, a bridge"). Some template constructions appear ("She'd been... But after... Now, she mapped"). Information density varies - strong in fossil interaction scenes, thinner in conceptual passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory mapping with emotional archaeology offers fresh angle on post-apocalyptic discovery narrative. "Factually mystical" creates productive tension. The heat-mapper translating emotions into color gradients is inventive. However, the "humans hibernate" worldbuilding remains vague, and the ending's uplift feels somewhat safe.</comment>
