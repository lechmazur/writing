<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's philosophical nature and patient hands are embodied through concrete actions (examining fulgurite, coaxing rope), and his motivation to preserve ancient methods drives clear choices. The internal conflict between skepticism and belief plays out through micro-choices, though the final renunciation/acceptance could carry more visible personal cost beyond intellectual revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through knot revelations, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where "the act of preservation itself" becomes the weavers' true legacy. The cost is primarily conceptual—Elias must abandon his search for a physical loom—though the emotional price could be more viscerally felt at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The golden dock, snow, and fog create atmospheric pressure that mirrors Elias's journey from clarity to mystery. The fulgurite glass functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (needed to read the rope), and sensory details like "salt-stiffened strands" and "oceanic hush" are filtered through Elias's patient, observant POV.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from decoding knots to understanding the weavers' true nature, with the fulgurite glass enabling progression through each knot's revelation. The woman's appearance provides external pressure, though the resolution lands more as philosophical acceptance than a choice with tangible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the rope-as-library metaphor and the preservation of ancient wisdom in everyday objects. The final realization that preservation is "the refusal to let ancient wisdom die" resonates without moralizing, though the woman's dialogue edges toward explicit theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elias's perceptual signature shows through selective attention to natural forms and patient observation ("infinitely patient hands," focus on patterns). Dialogue carries appropriate subtext, though the woman's speech occasionally drifts toward abstract pronouncement rather than naturalistic exchange.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose maintains strong rhythm and varies sentence structure effectively, with vivid specifics like "twisted tube of obsidian-black fused sand." Some filter verbs ("he realized," "he deduced") and occasional synonym churn ("ancient methods"/"ancient wisdom") slightly dull immediacy but don't obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The concept of knowledge encoded in rope knots viewed through fulgurite glass offers fresh specificity, transforming the treasure-hunt trope through concrete maritime details. The synthesis of natural phenomena (lightning-fused glass) with human craft (knotwork) creates an organic, non-obvious combination.</comment>
