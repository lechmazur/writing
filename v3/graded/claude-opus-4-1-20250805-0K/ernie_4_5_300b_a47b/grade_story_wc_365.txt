<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and embodied through the shard's physical pull ("throbbed like a second heartbeat") and his mother's disappearance drives authentic internal conflict. The final choice to throw away the shard shows meaningful change with visible cost ("his hands trembled"), though the emotional resolution feels slightly rushed in the denouement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Decisive Change occurs when Kael throws the shard into the portal, foreclosing his obsessive search with visible cost ("could still smell the ozone of that other world"). The causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkages from shard discovery to portal opening to confrontation with alternate mother. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract final insight about truth being "a thread, weaving through every choice."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The repair bay functions as more than backdrop—its "skeletal gantries" and "metal grid" constrain movement and the platform becomes quicksand during the portal opening. The parallel universe's "gleaming alloy" version creates meaningful contrast. Sensory details are vivid and POV-filtered through the visor's unique perception ("mosaic of colors only he could see").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to confronting the truth about his mother's disappearance, with the shard's pull "overriding his caution" creating genuine pressure. The choice between keeping or discarding the shard carries weight ("the truth was a knife that cut both ways"), though the alternate mother's appearance could have been more dramatically contested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action—the dangerous allure of seeking answers versus accepting ambiguity. The shard as both key and choice resonates, and the mother's warning "Some doors shouldn't be opened" gains meaning through dramatization. Final paragraph edges toward explicit moralizing ("The truth wasn't a thing to be found") which dulls the otherwise strong thematic work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature through the sensory map maker's visor creates a distinct way of seeing ("translated the echoes of a thousand universes into light"). Voice maintains consistency through technical precision and measured introspection. Dialogue feels natural with subtext ("Not exactly. But I've been waiting for you").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong moments ("Gravity reversed. Colors inverted.") and good syntactic variety. Some overwriting appears in metaphorical density ("the truth was a knife that cut both ways") and occasional redundancy ("cyclically spontaneous" used twice). The "murmur of half-remembered dreams" bookend feels slightly forced.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The sensory map maker's visor offers a fresh angle on portal fiction, translating universes into visual overlays. The parallel mother twist provides genuine surprise that feels earned. However, the core premise of dangerous knowledge and alternate realities follows familiar templates without sufficient transformation through lived detail.</comment>
