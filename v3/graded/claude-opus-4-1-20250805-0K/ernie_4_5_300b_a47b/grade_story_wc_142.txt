<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira's dual allegiance creates genuine internal tension, though her tactical shifts feel somewhat predictable. The stone chip functions as both tactile anchor and emotional weight, grounding her divided loyalty. Her final stance crystallizes with visible cost—the carnival's future remains uncertain but she's chosen her side.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as graffiti symbols layer into collective resistance, culminating in confrontation. The closure achieves Charged Poise—the Council withdraws but the threat persists, with cost visible in the "unwritten but possible" future. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words with Lira at the carnival's edge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The raft city's sensory details—"fried dough and diesel," graffiti-covered hulls—create lived-in texture that shapes choices. The Alley of Whispers constrains action and the stone chip grounds history in tactile form. Setting actively pressures through spatial organization and vendor resistance encoded in the environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal mediation to collective resistance as Lira transforms graffiti into organized opposition. The Council's arrival forces crystallization, though their withdrawal feels slightly convenient. Cost registers in the provisional victory—"The fight wasn't over"—with the carnival's soul preserved but future uncertain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The chaos/order paradox emerges through concrete details rather than assertion, with the stone chip anchoring authenticity against "sterilized charm." The graffiti-as-language conceit deepens from vandalism to encoded resistance. Final image of reorganized alleys "tempered by purpose" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception—Lira notices layout, patterns, encoded messages. Dialogue differentiates characters adequately (Jax's casual "madwoman" vs. Council's "ice" formality). Some filter verb accumulation ("told her," "felt") dulls immediacy in transition passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variation, though some scaffolding appears ("Over the next week," "For a moment"). Information density is solid—most sentences advance multiple elements. Minor template cadence in middle section ("She'd spent years...She'd begun...") but doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The graffiti-as-organized-resistance concept transforms a familiar gentrification narrative through specific invention. Using visual chaos to create systematic opposition shows genuine ingenuity. The culture shock absorber role and floating carnival setting avoid generic protest story templates through particular detail.</comment>
