Looking at this story through the lens of a demanding editor, I'll evaluate it as an Accumulative/Textural piece that builds toward a revelation about the port as a living machine.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Anya's motivation rooted in her mentor's death provides clear emotional grounding, and her methodical investigation reveals character through action. The engineer's transformation and final cryptic state work thematically but lack the embodied specificity needed for higher scores—his "glazed eyes" and "pale skin" are stock descriptors that don't earn the weight of his revelation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where the port reveals itself as a hungry machine, but the cost remains largely abstract—"some machines, once awakened, never truly sleep" gestures at consequence without making it visceral. The accumulative build through wind patterns and the patch's vibrations creates texture, yet the final transformation from investigation to cosmic horror feels slightly unearned given the realistic opening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The container yard setting actively shapes the investigation and creates the wind vortices central to the mystery. Sensory details like "salt-stained gravel" and "sodium lights" ground us effectively, and the containers' arrangement as both setting and antagonist shows strong integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulating details—wind patterns, the patch's vibrations, the engineer's discovery—but lacks a decisive moment where Anya must choose or sacrifice something tangible. The revelation lands intellectually but doesn't force her into a corner where the cost becomes undeniable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of technology becoming autonomous and hungry emerges organically through the investigation, avoiding explicit moralizing. The patch as a recurring motif that "vibrates" and "syncs with her heartbeat" creates resonance, though the final insight about awakened machines could push deeper into specific consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains professional precision appropriate to an investigator—"documenting airspeed and direction"—with occasional lyric touches like "silence had settled like a second skin." The shift to more ominous register in the climax supports the genre turn, though some phrases like "the machine was hungry" edge toward the generic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose generally flows well with varied sentence structures and strong momentum. However, several instances of telling rather than showing ("Her task was to survey," "Her motivation was personal") and some repetitive constructions ("Anya moved," "Anya climbed," "Anya descended") prevent higher scoring. The metaphor "puzzle box designed to outthink her" works but doesn't quite earn its conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of a port becoming a sentient feedback loop offers genuine freshness, transforming a mundane investigation into cosmic horror. The specific detail of wind vortices created by container arrangements shows originality, though the execution could push further into the uncanny rather than settling for "the machine was hungry."</comment>
