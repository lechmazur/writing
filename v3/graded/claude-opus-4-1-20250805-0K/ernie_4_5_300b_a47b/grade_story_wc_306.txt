<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias's "conscience for hire" profession creates a compelling contradiction between his role as doubt-merchant and his moment of genuine clarity-offering to Mira. The shift from "sincerely insincere" cynicism to authentic connection lands with earned cost. Minor deduction for some abstract interiority ("terrifying. And exhilarating") that could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira moves from paralyzed grief to active choice about "which chimes to keep," with the cost visible in removing the sharp/dissonant notes. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details (chimes, cloak weight) build toward meaning-shift. Slight opacity around the husband's actual fate prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse interior's "damp wood and old oil" smell and the tactile weight of the doubt-cloak effectively constrain perception and choice. The wind chimes as setting-objects that must be physically "unhooked" to achieve clarity elevates this beyond decoration. Missing a bit of spatial grounding in the tower scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Mira's initial grief through Elias experiencing the cloak's disorienting power to the decisive act of removing specific chimes. The cost manifests in what must be surrendered (the oak chime's "mournful whine") to achieve harmony. Could push harder on what Mira risks by choosing clarity over comfortable haunting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The metaphor of truth as "not a single note, but a chord, complex and dissonant" beautifully emerges from the concrete chime-work rather than being stated. The ending image of Elias carrying away the "ghost of Mira's husband's laughter" in the hollow mirror reweights the opening's "conscience for hire" with earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in how Elias processes through sound and texture ("hummed in his grip," parsing chime tones). Dialogue carries effective subtext, especially "Doubt doesn't keep a schedule." Minor convergence in voice when both characters use similar registers during emotional peaks weakens distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with evocative phrases like "the world had turned to shades of gray—a fitting canvas for a conscience for hire." Some redundancy in explaining the cloak's effect ("stripping away the noise of certainty to reveal the quiet chaos beneath") after showing it. Template phrasing in "frowned," "nodded," "stepped closer" action beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fresh concept of a "conscience for hire" who uses doubt as a tool transforms the typical ghost-story frame. The specific synthesis of wind chimes as truth-carriers that must be selectively edited creates an original metaphor for grief-work. Risk-taking in the ambiguous ending where resolution comes through subtraction rather than addition.</comment>
