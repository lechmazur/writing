<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kieran's motivation to "spark a silent revolution" drives consistent choices through decoding the sundial and descending to the cradle. The internal conflict between vigilance (his role) and revolution (his desire) creates productive tension, though emotional embodiment remains somewhat abstract during peak moments. The final choice to ignite revolution lands with conviction but lacks visceral cost beyond declaration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout creates urgency → sundial decoded via quill holder → hidden chamber revealed → revolution sparked. The Decisive Change from isolated dissent to organized network lands on-page with the cradle's discovery. Cost remains more conceptual than felt—"when the lights return, the Council will see" suggests future consequence rather than immediate price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The luminous fort at twilight anchors atmosphere effectively, with the blackout creating temporal pressure. The sundial's bronze angles and the hidden chamber provide concrete spatial choreography. However, setting functions more as backdrop than active constraint—the fort's architecture doesn't meaningfully limit choices or force specific tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal puzzle-solving to network activation as Kieran and Elara decode the sundial together. The blackout as "test" raises pressure, forcing action before lights return. The tightening from individual vigilance to collective revolution lands, though the Council remains abstract opposition without immediate counterforce.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "cradle of sparks" metaphor effectively bridges literal (hidden chamber) and thematic (revolutionary network) meanings. Theme emerges through action—decoding, descending, discovering—rather than declaration. The final image of "light flickered in the form of ideas" resonates but edges toward abstraction rather than concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains consistency through Kieran's perspective. Voice modulates between contemplative observation and urgent action, though diction occasionally elevates beyond the guard's plausible register ("luminous fort," "cryptic angles"). Dialogue between Kieran and Elara carries functional subtext but lacks distinctive character rhythms.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Some elevated diction strains ("winking hush of their footsteps," "glittering facade") without earning resonance. Information density stays reasonable though several passages restate concepts ("cradle of sparks" explained multiple times). The final paragraph slides into abstract declaration rather than concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sundial-as-cipher concept offers a fresh angle on revolution plotting, avoiding typical violence or confrontation. The astronomer's incomplete work adds intrigue. However, the revolution-through-knowledge premise follows familiar templates, and the Council-as-oppressor dynamic lacks specific transformation beyond archetype.</comment>
