<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation as a celestial interpreter seeking "the beginning in every ending" drives consistent choices through dismantling the tower's systems to access the hush. His mantra "discard assumptions" manifests in concrete actions, though internal conflict could be more embodied during the transformation sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration as the tower transforms from abandoned ruin to living network. The closure lands with visible transformation and conceptual cost (letting go enables rebirth), though the final "doorways" line edges toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The radio tower city's skeletal architecture and gorge setting create atmospheric pressure, with the Hollywood fragment's holographic projection effectively constraining Kael's choices. The transformation of the gorge into "liquid light" charges the final image, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("spectral fingers").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation builds through Kael's progressive dismantling of the tower's systems, with each discarded component bringing the hush into sharper focus. The cost manifests in the searing heat of the fragment and the tower's complete transformation, though agency could be tested more severely.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of finding beginnings in endings emerges through concrete action rather than statement, with the hush as potential rather than absence. However, the final paragraph's "endings were merely doorways, and silence was the key" veers into explicit moralizing that undermines the otherwise earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive perceptual signature in phrases like "serenely electric static" and "mosaic of shattered glass and circuitry." Some elevated diction ("spectral fingers," "labyrinth of steel") occasionally drifts from Kael's technical mindset.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong imagery like "liquid light winding through the rocks." Minor overwriting in metaphors ("skeletal hand," "spectral fingers") and the final paragraph's thematic summary weakens momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of radio technology with cosmic interpretation creates an original premise. The concept of "hush" as language/potential rather than absence offers genuine insight, though the execution occasionally relies on familiar post-apocalyptic imagery.</comment>
