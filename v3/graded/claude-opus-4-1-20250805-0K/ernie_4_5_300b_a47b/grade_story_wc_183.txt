<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong dual-protagonist characterization with Lira and Veyra's symbiotic tension driving choices throughout. The sisters' contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene (skepticism vs. belief), and their final choice to plant their own name carries visible cost—abandoning the ship and their past. Minor deduction for some expository interiority ("Aberrant was her middle name") that tells rather than embodies.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught progression through narrative threads, emerald card, and name-flowers building to Resonant Reconfiguration. The garden's transformation from myth to choice ("The garden isn't a place—it's a choice") lands with felt cost as the ship vanishes. Orientation anchors established early (abandoned carnival ship, foggy bay, chimera twins).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The carnival ship functions as micro-setting that constrains choices—hidden door, calliope key, sewn journal pages guide the search. Environmental details evolve causally (fog thickening/parting, ship vanishing). The emerald card's teeth marks and nameplates charge the final image of planting names in soil.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the garden) escalates through Veyra's skepticism, the hidden room discovery, and memory flooding that reweights the quest's meaning. The cost is legible—losing the ship as "trapped freedom" transforms to "just freedom." One meaningful deepening occurs when the garden reveals itself as choice rather than place.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the garden's conceptual shift from physical location to act of remembrance. The final image of the twin-petaled flower reweights "blissfully aberrant" and "trapped freedom" without moralizing. Subtext operates through Veyra's growl-to-smile transformation and the seamstress's buried story.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct voices for Lira (hopeful seeker) and Veyra (growl-hiss skeptic) with dialogue carrying subtext and goal pursuit. Some register drift in peak moments ("narrative threads," "symbiosis of chaos and order") that exceeds the POV's established lexicon. Clean free indirect style maintains consistent psychic distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Deductions for template cadence in descriptive passages ("She saw...She'd found...She'd pieced") and some overwriting in figurative language ("living contradiction, a symbiosis of chaos and order"). Information density is moderate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The chimera twin fusion and garden-as-choice concept offer fresh angles on memory and identity themes. Specific details (teeth marks on cards, names sewn into walls) avoid generic abstraction. The transformation of "trapped freedom" to "just freedom" provides a non-obvious resolution that feels earned.</comment>
