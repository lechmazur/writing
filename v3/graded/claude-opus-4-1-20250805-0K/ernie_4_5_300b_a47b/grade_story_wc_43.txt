<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong embodied emotion through Mira's physical interaction with the vinyl shard and her concrete professional actions. The father-daughter dynamic creates genuine pressure that forces Mira's choices. Minor deduction for slight therapy-speak ("reunification") and the convenience of Elias's sudden ability to sing after days of silence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase building to Elias's death and the vinyl shard's transfer to Clara. The closure lands with felt cost through death and legacy continuation. Orientation anchors establish clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of Elias finding his voice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hospice setting constrains choices through medical reality ("blood work came back, only hours"). Sensory detail like "lavender and hope" and the "radiant haven above the clouds" creates atmosphere. The vinyl shard functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when passed to Clara.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional duty to personal resonance as Elias reminds Mira of her mother. The tightening occurs through Elias's progression from silence to singing to death. Cost is visible through Clara's grief and Mira's emotional response. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the hymn's lyrics about "light persisting through darkness" and the vinyl shard's journey from mother to Mira to Clara. The "scent of hope" motif accumulates meaning. Minor deduction for slightly explicit thematic statement about "hymning the mundane" and the overwrought "labyrinth of grief."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("the sunrise flooding the radiant haven"). Dialogue carries subtext effectively in Elias's fragmented singing. Some register elevation ("alchemy of melody," "pulsing stillness") slightly mismatches the intimate hospice moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good momentum through varied sentence structures. Information density strong in moments like the vinyl playing sequence. Deductions for overwrought phrases ("alchemy of melody," "labyrinth of grief") and slight template cadence in "Mira nodded... Mira smiled... Mira straightened."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hospice music therapy angle offers specificity, and the vinyl shard as inherited talisman adds particularity. However, the dying-patient-finds-voice-through-music arc follows familiar templates. The ending's hope-through-legacy theme, while executed competently, doesn't transform the expected beats.</comment>
