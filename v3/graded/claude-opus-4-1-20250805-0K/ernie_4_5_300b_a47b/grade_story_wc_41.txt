<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's precognitive forgetfulness creates genuine internal contradiction between knowing and forgetting, with embodied details like "hands raw from handling wood" and "knees aching." The final choice to embrace the sound rather than chase visions shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Motivation stays consistent throughout, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("a curse he'd inherited").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks and density increases building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts present echoes over future visions. Cost is legible in "I was here. I heard it. I remembered" - the chalk line thicker and bolder signals acceptance of fragments over wholeness. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (Elias, sculpture garden, fog).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sculpture garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice - Elias must navigate specific sculptures to find echoes, with "twisted rebar and rusted car doors" creating tactile specificity. Driftwood markers physically shape his search pattern. The fog both muffles and reveals, charging the final image when it thins to allow the sound through.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing the sound of growing older) signals early and tightens through failed attempts and adjusted markers. The pressure coheres under accumulative lens as fog shifts, visions slip away, and physical exhaustion builds. Cost appears in accepting fragments over wholeness, though the middle section could show more distinct pressure points.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars - chalk as talisman, driftwood as futile markers, the sound as acceptance of aging's fragmentary nature. The final bold chalk line reweights earlier "faint lines" without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the gap between prophet and forgetfulness, though one instance of "tidal longing" feels slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature in "fog clung...like a second skin" and selective attention to echoes over visual clarity. Voice modulates effectively from contemplative opening to urgent searching to peaceful acceptance. Some filter phrases ("he felt the familiar tug") and one instance of elevated diction ("monument to forgotten things") slightly above POV's established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though "He'd heard it once...but it had slipped away" appears twice conceptually. Strong opening and closing lines that mirror each other purposefully. Information density high in descriptions like "twisted metal forms within" doing atmosphere and constraint work. Minor template cadence in "He knelt...he took...he drew...he began."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of precognitive gift with forgetfulness creates non-obvious tension. The specific detail of chalk as talisman for failed attempts and driftwood as physical manifestation of mental searching elevates beyond template. Risk in making protagonist's disability his strength pays off at closure.</comment>
