<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve forgotten stories is clear and consistent, driving concrete actions like probing the ashes and transcribing symbols. The internal tension between documenting vs. listening creates genuine complexity. However, the final transformation from passive collector to active listener feels slightly rushed, though the cost of his previous "ignoring" lands effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through layered discoveries (diaries, tapestry, symbols) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias shifts from collecting to acknowledging stories. The "displaced axis" concept effectively structures the narrative as a shift in attention rather than reality. Cost is legible in the recognition of humanity's collective indifference, though the magical realism of the unfurling dragons slightly weakens causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The silo library setting functions as both physical space and metaphorical repository, with walls literally holding memories. Sensory details like "bronze quiet" and "steel ribs rusting into the earth" create atmosphere while the fireplace and its contents provide concrete obstacles. The setting constrains choices effectively but doesn't quite reach the level where removal would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through discoveries that deepen understanding: Clara's diaries reveal the ritual, the tapestry contains hidden language, symbols match diary entries. The stakes shift from documenting to recognizing ignored stories, with the cost manifesting as humanity's collective failure to listen. The final acknowledgment carries weight, though the supernatural resolution slightly reduces earned agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of listening versus ignoring emerges organically through concrete discoveries rather than stated morals. The displaced axis metaphor works on multiple levels—perception, attention, interpretation—without becoming heavy-handed. The final image of voices rising from walls offers a resonant answer to why dreams ended: not from exhaustion but from indifference.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent intellectual curiosity with phrases like "whispers of inanimate things" and "bronze quiet" that feel particular to Elias's historian perspective. The free indirect style effectively modulates between observation and reflection. Minor weakness in the slightly elevated register during the final paragraph that doesn't quite match earlier diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm modulation. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some metaphorical density in the opening ("bones of a forgotten god") and occasional filter verbs ("he wondered," "he realized") create minor drag but don't obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of walls retaining memories and the "displaced axis" as perceptual shift offers fresh angle on post-apocalyptic tropes. Clara's ritual of burning diaries to embed stories in steel shows inventive world-building. The transformation feels earned through accumulated particulars, though the ending's magical realism is somewhat expected for this genre.</comment>
