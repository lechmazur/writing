I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through lyric density and pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elias releases his locked grief.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation coheres through concrete embodiment—the key burning against his thigh, his need to discover "the color of sound" rooted in Lila's final words. The internal contradiction between hiding behind duty and seeking ghosts plays out in action. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient epiphany about luminous vows, though the final renunciation lands with genuine cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias transforms from hiding behind truth to acknowledging his luminous vow, with the cost visible in years of denial now released. The accumulative structure builds through water imagery, light motifs, and the library discovery to the final "I see you now" moment. Orientation anchors cleanly establish pier/harbor/lantern festival setting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sunken ship library constrains choice perfectly—Elias must wade through cold water, the key must fit, the pristine interior contrasts the decay. Setting details like "planks groaned like old bones" and "meteor hush" create lived atmosphere. The library's magical preservation strains slightly but serves the conceptual frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes build from external quest (finding the library) to internal recognition (accepting his grief). The key fitting lock "13" creates meaningful coincidence that forces confrontation. Cost is visible in decades of denial, though the resolution comes somewhat easily once inside the library.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through the central metaphor: "Sound is the color of memory." The luminous vows concept integrates naturally with Elias's journey from hiding to acknowledgment. The final image of him walking home with "the color of sound humming in his veins" resonates without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled metaphor ("meteor hush," "skeleton finger"). POV stays grounded in Elias's perception. Some elevated diction ("coalescing into a swirl") slightly exceeds a lamplighter's natural lexicon but supports the magical realist tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("grotesque smiles," "jagged shadows"). Information density high—most sentences advance atmosphere and meaning simultaneously. Minor template cadence in "He reached...As he opened...Elias watched" sequence but doesn't pervade.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief, light, and sound into a quest for synesthetic understanding offers fresh angle on loss. The sunken library as pristine preserve of memory transforms the treasure-hunt trope. Risk-taking in the magical realist elements pays off through emotional specificity.</comment>
