I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Identification:** This story operates under a **Hybrid** lens, beginning with Accumulative/Textural elements (collecting fragments, layering stories) but shifting to Causal at closure when Kael discovers he is Marcus Hale and determines to find those who erased him.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation crystallizes effectively through the death certificate discovery and his compulsive fragment-collecting, with genuine internal contradiction between accepting erasure and seeking truth. The final determination to "make them remember" feels earned through accumulated pressure, though some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("filtered reality differently") rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story achieves Charged Poise closure when Kael/Marcus stands at the container's edge with newfound identity and purpose—options crystallized, cost implied through the skeleton discovery. The hybrid lens holds adequately, though the shift from accumulative collecting to causal conspiracy-solving could be smoother. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line three.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The shipping container labyrinth functions as more than backdrop—it conceals secrets, shifts with tides, and forces Kael's climbing/searching choices. Vivid sensory work ("salt tang biting his throat," "flaking paint, its surface cold and gritty") grounds the setting, and the tidal rhythm provides temporal structure that constrains his movements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal identity mystery to active conspiracy when the skeleton/locket discovery transforms Kael's understanding. The storm sequence provides physical pressure that leads to the crucial find, though the final conspiracy revelation arrives somewhat abruptly through "whisper on the wind" rather than earned discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The erasure/memory theme emerges organically through collected fragments building toward identity reconstruction. The poison label's inscription "For the rats. Not for the remembering" resonates as both literal object and thematic anchor, and the final determination to "make them remember" offers a non-literal answer to the identity question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with Kael seeing "the green of jealousy in a smuggler's coat, the violet of regret in a widow's veil" establishes unique filtering. Dialogue feels natural when present ("Disappeared into the tide, they say"), though the narrative occasionally drifts into elevated register ("labyrinth swallowed them whole") slightly beyond the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("containers loomed like steel mountains...clawed at the bruised sky"). Minor template cadence appears in "Kael's mind reeled. The fragments he'd collected...They were clues" sequence. Information density stays high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of identity erasure through bureaucratic fiction offers fresh angle on amnesia tropes. The synesthetic perception detail ("colors bled into hues only he saw") provides memorable specificity, and the fragment-collecting methodology creates organic mystery-solving distinct from typical detective work.</comment>
