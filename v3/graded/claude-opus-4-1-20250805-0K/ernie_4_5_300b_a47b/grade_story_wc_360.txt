<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's transformation from analytical detachment to emotional integration is earned through concrete embodied beats, particularly when the fragment merges his perspective with Veyra's. His habitual personality-borrowing trait actively drives the experiment and pays cost when his method fails catastrophically. Internal contradictions act simultaneously in scene when he experiences both the "cold thrill of a breakthrough" and raw emotional wildfire.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure: Elias shifts from believing emotions are variables to understanding them as "rhythms to be felt," with visible cost in his tears and the destruction of his analytical framework. The causal chain holds from his deliberate ambiguity method through the fragment's response to the final integration. Orientation anchors workshop/stars/fragment clearly by ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The workshop setting with "burnt sapphire and iron filings" creates specific atmosphere, and the halo fragment functions as both setting element and constraint that shapes Elias's choices. Stars "bleeding into horizon" and "vanishing constellations" establish temporal pressure. The letterpress machine's physical presence enables the central experiment, though some spatial choreography during the chaos could be clearer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Central stake of understanding emotion's mathematics escalates from theoretical experiment to visceral merger that destroys Elias's detachment. The fragment's resistance creates genuine opposition, and the cost is legible when his analytical framework crumbles. One meaningful deepening occurs when the fragment flares and forces empathic merger, though additional intermediate pressure points could strengthen escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete tension between analysis and feeling, with the fragment serving as mirror rather than tool. The final realization that emotions are "rhythms to be felt" reweights all prior analytical attempts without stating a moral. Subtext operates well through Veyra's cryptic warnings and the fragment's reactive light patterns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias's analytical nature, with distinctive phrases like "stars bled into the horizon" and "lucid turbulence." POV control stays clean through the merger sequence despite perspective shift. Some filter verbs ("he saw," "he felt") during peak pressure slightly dull immediacy, and dialogue could carry more subtext beyond direct statements.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong imagery with "halo fragment suspended...pulsed like a half-remembered heartbeat" and varied sentence structures. However, some paraphrase loops appear ("Emotions weren't variables; they were wildfires" followed by restatement), and filter verb clustering in the merger sequence ("He saw...felt...stumbled") reduces immediacy. The "lucid turbulence" phrase feels slightly forced as title-drop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of emotions as mathematical variables subverted by their wildfire nature offers a fresh angle on the empathy theme. Elias's personality-borrowing method creates an original approach to understanding others. The halo fragment from "cratered moon where angels fought" adds mythic specificity, though the core analytical-versus-feeling tension follows familiar patterns.</comment>
