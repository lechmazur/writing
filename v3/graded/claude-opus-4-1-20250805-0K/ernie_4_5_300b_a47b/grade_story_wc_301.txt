I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered discoveries of graffiti messages that reweight Mara's understanding of forgiveness, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict between mapping external rivers and navigating internal guilt creates genuine tension, with the medication cessation adding psychological complexity. The final choice to draw "a new kind of map: one of her heart" shows earned transformation through concrete action, though some interiority borders on therapy-speak ("festering beneath the surface").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure works well as Mara discovers graffiti messages that progressively reframe forgiveness from destination to current to surrender. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when she creates her emotional map and sees "Begin" - a Charged Poise moment with clear cost in abandoning her methodical external mapping for messy internal navigation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The disused station functions as more than backdrop - its liminal nature ("neither city nor wilderness") mirrors Mara's psychological state and the ivy preserves graffiti like "a green archive." The drainpipe leading to the tributary creates spatial progression that enables the accordion playing scene, making setting integral to character action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen through accumulation as each graffiti message forces Mara to confront her stagnant guilt, building to her decision to map her heart instead of rivers. The cost is visible when she abandons her "meticulous, daringly methodical sketches" for something "meandering and messy," though the escalation could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the graffiti's collective wisdom about forgiveness as flow rather than destination. The river metaphor deepens from physical to emotional mapping, and the final "Begin" avoids moralizing while offering resonant closure that reweights all prior searching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception filtered through Mara's chronicler lens ("patched with electrical tape and weather-stained"). The prose modulates effectively between clinical observation and raw emotion, though occasional phrases like "festering and bloomed" feel slightly overwrought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with strong moments like "ivy that clawed at the cracked brickwork like a thousand green fingers." Some redundancy appears ("festering" used twice, "methodical/meticulous" repetition) and occasional overwriting ("raw, unfiltered edge"), but momentum remains strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of bathroom graffiti as emotional map references shows genuine originality, transforming vandalism into "collective guide." The synthesis of river chronicling with self-forgiveness feels fresh, and the risk of using an unreliable narrator off medication pays off in the heightened perception.</comment>
