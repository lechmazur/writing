I'll evaluate this story under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's desperation and skepticism create genuine internal tension, particularly in "Ghosts don't eat rocks. They eat regrets." The final shift from jocularity-as-shield to jocularity-as-bridge shows earned character movement with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the conductor's reframing of loneliness as "a language" and Elias's chest no longer aching, showing felt cost. The accumulative progression from rumor to ritual to revelation coheres, though the mechanics of the "cure" remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The station operates as active setting—ivy that "pulsed like a second heartbeat," tracks vanishing into walls, the breathing chamber all constrain movement and choice. The bioluminescent graffiti and dissolving train mural charge the final transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from seeking a cure to confronting what loneliness actually is, with the moon rock's warming and pulsing marking progression. The conductor's challenge forces Elias to reconsider his entire premise, though the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the reciprocity concept—moon rock's untouched isolation versus the ghost's accumulated sorrow. The final reframing of loneliness as "the space between" that needs conversation, not curing, resonates without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct voices emerge—Elias's "desperate, jocular bark" versus Lira's sharp precision ("That's the catalyst"). The conductor's layered whispers and Lira's "Polite anarchy wins again" maintain character-specific registers throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid moments like "boots squelched in mud" and "shadows that danced like dervishes." Some overwriting appears ("pulsed like a second heartbeat," "sharp as glass shards") but doesn't obscure key beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise of feeding moon rock to a station ghost to cure loneliness through reciprocity offers genuine freshness. The transformation of loneliness from plague to language to "space between" provides non-obvious insight.</comment>
