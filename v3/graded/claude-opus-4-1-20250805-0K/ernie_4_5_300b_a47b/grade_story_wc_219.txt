I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's exacting standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant with Causal elements). The story builds through textural details (sculptures, amber dissolution, bronze quiet) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lirael's skepticism transforms into felt understanding.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lirael's skepticism-to-obsession arc lands with earned complexity through the amber catalyst moment. The contradictory impulses between academic rebellion and desperate searching for belonging play out in scene. Minor deduction for Kael's slightly convenient wisdom-dispensing role without sufficient pressure on her own stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through Lirael's chest-ache of "familiar longing" and breaking-glass laugh—a Charged Poise where understanding crystallizes. The amber-as-catalyst provides causal linkage while the accumulative sculpture path builds texture. Cost reads as the unraveling of her protective skepticism, though the emotional price could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sculpture path functions as micro-setting that constrains movement and charges the final convergence. "Bronze quiet" and "moss and memory" create distinctive atmosphere. The amber's dissolution into golden mist that envelops the tower provides strong sensory specificity that directly enables closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (exposing fraud vs. discovering truth) tightens when the amber dissolves and reality inverts. However, Kael's appearance reduces tension by providing explanations rather than forcing Lirael to discover through action. The "familiar longing" provides emotional cost but lacks the visceral price that would elevate further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of authentic vs. manufactured belonging emerges through the sculptures-as-mirrors metaphor and the chemistry/emotion dichotomy. The final revelation that homecoming is "collision—of memory, desire, and the unyielding present" reweights the entire artificial pilgrimage concept. Slight deduction for Kael's overly articulate thematic statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature in "luminous skeptic with a mind sharper than the storm's edge" and controlled shifts during the reality-inversion sequence. Dialogue between Lirael and Kael carries appropriate subtext but occasionally drifts toward exposition ("The Enclave believes it can be bottled. I believe it can't."). Voice maintains consistency through the pressure moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clean, purposeful prose with strong rhythm variation and selective detail. "The bronze quiet lingered" and "somewhere in the distance, a door creaked open" provide excellent closure cadence. Minor figurative excess in "dying star" glow and "liquid mercury" eyes that slightly clutters peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of chemical/spiritual journey offers a fresh angle on belonging narratives. The sculpture path as progressive revelation and the amber-as-catalyst concept show originality. However, the wise-guide-explains-the-mystery structure follows familiar patterns without sufficient transformation.</comment>
