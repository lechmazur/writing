<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in personal history (father's key, slum origins), with embodied stress ("breath fogged," "heart pounded"). The final choice to distribute evidence shows agency with implied cost, though internal contradiction could be more visceral during action beats. Her competence balances with genuine risk during the underwater escape.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore linkages from infiltration to evidence theft to distribution. Closure lands as Decisive Change when Mara hands off the drive, foreclosing her safety with visible cost (relay station destroyed, drones hunting). The "line has held" reprises the motivation with earned weight, though the explosion's convenience slightly softens the cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The auric lagoon's "molten gold" water and bioluminescent tunnel create vivid, purposeful atmosphere that enables the infiltration route. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from mangroves to underwater tunnel to relay station. The lagoon's color shift from gold to silver at closure subtly mirrors the transformation from hidden to revealed truth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal proof ("prove them wrong") to systemic exposure of erased dissent, with the three-minute drone window creating time pressure. The underwater escape with exploding station provides concrete cost. Agency drives the infiltration and evidence distribution, though the explosion's timing feels slightly convenient rather than earned through protagonist choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of resistance against erasure emerges through concrete action (stealing evidence, distributing truth) rather than declaration. The phone booth key as rebellion artifact and "indifference kills faster than bullets" avoid platitudes. The ending image of Mara alone with the key while stars "wink like secrets" offers resonance, though the thematic weight could deepen beyond resistance-versus-tyranny.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third with selective perception ("steel vultures," water holding secrets). Dialogue differentiates characters adequately ("You're late" versus "Carefully resourceful, as always"). Some filter phrases ("Mara's mind raced," "she saw") dull immediacy during action beats, and vocabulary occasionally drifts toward generic thriller register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is adequate with most lines advancing plot or atmosphere. However, some template phrasing appears ("burst into," "shower of sparks") and filter verbs cluster in action sequences. The opening and closing images connect effectively through the lagoon's transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The puddle-reflection navigation trick and phone booth key as rebellion node offer fresh angles on resistance thriller tropes. Mara's combination of lock-picking and constellation-reading specificity elevates the "underdog rebel" archetype. The concept of revised histories as erasure weapon is solid though not groundbreaking; execution relies somewhat on familiar dystopian elements.</comment>
