<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clara's internal conflict between safety and authenticity drives meaningful choices, particularly her decision to leave the compass behind. The "merrily melancholic" emotional complexity lands naturally without diagnostic language. Minor deduction for the grandfather's backstory feeling slightly convenient as wisdom-source, though it anchors her present struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Clara shifts from navigating by inherited tools to "the weight of her own choices." The accumulative/textural lens holds as memories and images layer toward her final stance. Cost is visible in abandoning the compass—her last connection to her grandfather—and choosing uncertainty over safety.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse and utility poles constrain Clara's navigation choices and charge the final realization about "human stubbornness." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("liquid mercury," "skeletal tower"). The shifting pole shadows create genuine disorientation that matters to her journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from external navigation to internal reckoning as the compass reveals itself as a "measure of regret." The lighthouse climb and decision to leave the compass create meaningful tightening. Cost is legible in her acceptance that "chaos...was indifferent" and choosing to navigate without anchors.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the navigation metaphor without explicit moralizing until a brief slip ("I'm done hiding"). The compass-as-regret realization reweights earlier scratches as "choices she'd second-guessed." Final image of being "swallowed" by town lights while not mourning the compass resonates without stating conclusions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct voice with controlled metaphorical register ("salt air bit," "horizon feels unstable"). Some filter-verb clustering in middle sections dulls immediacy. POV remains stable with appropriate uncertainty about the compass's true nature until discovered through use.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Deductions for scattered template phrases ("clutched in her palm," "gripped the paddle tighter") and one metaphor stretch ("sharp as a sextant's edge"). The "merrily melancholic" repetition works as intentional echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of navigation-as-life-philosophy with specific details like utility poles as "land's bones." The compass transforming from directional tool to regret-measure shows genuine insight. Slightly derivative setup (found object in grandfather's attic) but transformed through specific execution.</comment>
