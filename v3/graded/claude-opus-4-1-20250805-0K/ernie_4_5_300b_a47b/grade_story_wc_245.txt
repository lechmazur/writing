I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through sensory accumulation and pattern intensification toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elias finds his mother and discovers "the place where feeling becomes seeing."

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to follow his mother's ghost melody is clear and embodied through tactile sensation. The contradiction between his blindness and mapmaking profession creates inherent tension. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution where his mother appears "as memory made flesh" without sufficient grounding in the established world rules.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure building through layered sensory details toward the stillpoint discovery. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias finds "the place where feeling becomes seeing" with his mother. Minor deduction because the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt - the journey's difficulty is stated but not fully dramatized in the final beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest setting directly constrains and enables Elias's journey through frequencies, textures, and the inverted river. Sensory detail is rich and POV-filtered through touch and vibration. The environment actively shapes choices, particularly the Silver Vein commanding him to dig.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding the stillpoint/mother) drives forward through accumulating sensory pressures. The ring's translations and the river's command create meaningful turns. However, escalation plateaus rather than intensifies - the discovery feels predetermined rather than hard-won against mounting opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of a blind mapmaker navigating emotional rather than physical terrain. The final line "where feeling becomes seeing" resonantly reweights the entire journey. Slight deduction for the abstract phrasing of "uncharted emotional depths" early on.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature filtering everything through touch, vibration, and non-visual sensation. The prose rhythm modulates with the forest's frequencies. Minor filter-verb clustering ("seemed to say") and some register elevation ("celestial hush") that doesn't fully match Elias's grounded perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with good sensory density and momentum. Some overwriting in phrases like "pause of shifting constellations" and "time pooled like mercury." The metaphor mixing of time as both pausing and pooling creates slight incoherence. Strong information density overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The blind mapmaker navigating by ultrasonic translation offers a fresh angle on the quest narrative. The synthesis of disability, synesthesia, and emotional cartography feels specific. The mother appearing as "memory made flesh" trends toward the expected rather than surprising.</comment>
