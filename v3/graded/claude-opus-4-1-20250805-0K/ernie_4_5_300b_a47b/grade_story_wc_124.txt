I'll evaluate this story under an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds through sensory memories and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lirael's aromatic sensitivity drives concrete choices—uncorking the vial despite known risks, embracing rather than flinching from scents. The inherited grief revelation ("a tapestry of inherited sorrow woven into her DNA") lands with embodied specificity through tears and throat-tightening, though the epiphany arrives somewhat abruptly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure builds from cautious avoidance through risk-taking to acceptance, with the ultraviolet revealing as the decisive turn. The closure—breathing in city smells without flinching—demonstrates clear before/after with emotional cost paid through witnessed grief. The inherited memory device strains plausibility slightly but serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively constrains choice through its extinct specimens and ultraviolet panels that trigger transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"prismatic streaks," "crystal shadows dancing"—with the vial's placement "between two ferns" grounding the space. The final city smells of "rain and distant woodsmoke" effectively contrast the enclosed greenhouse atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on understanding the source of grief, with pressure building through Lirael's decision to risk the ultraviolet method despite being "aromatically cautious." The vision sequence deepens rather than reverses, showing the woman's joy-to-loss arc that mirrors Lirael's inherited sorrow. Cost manifests through "hot and sudden" tears and the acceptance of grief as "proof that she was alive."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that "grief wasn't something to be feared; it was a testament to love." The perfume-as-memory-vessel concept avoids abstraction through specific sensory details. The ending's shift from cautious avoidance to grateful breathing offers a non-literal answer about embracing rather than fleeing emotional inheritance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm—"The greenhouse for extinct plants hummed with a quiet, almost sacred energy." POV remains stable in close third, though some passages edge toward omniscient summary ("The perfume wasn't just a scent; it was a vessel for memory"). Perceptual signature is strong in sensory selectivity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty—"crystal shadows dancing across the walls, shifting hues that mirrored emotions rather than objects"—but suffers from abstract telling in places ("grief wasn't something to be feared"). Some redundancy appears in the explanation of inherited sorrow. The filter verb "she saw" in the vision sequence dulls immediacy where direct perception would strengthen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The extinct plant greenhouse premise offers fresh ground, and the ultraviolet memory extraction method provides an original angle on inherited trauma. The synthesis of botanical preservation with emotional archaeology feels specific. However, the grief-as-gift resolution trends toward familiar territory without fully transforming it through unique particulars.</comment>
