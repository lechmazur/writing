<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to quiet the storm through empathy is clear and consistent, with embodied details like "her shadow stretching long across the snow." The internal logic of weaving together past empathy to fortify the present feels earned. However, the emotional progression through the mirrors lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—she processes each glimpse too smoothly without genuine internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara transforming the storm by "giving it a heart," with visible cost implied through the fragments of tragedy she absorbs. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the mirror visions. The orientation is clear early (lighthouse keeper, ice floes, approaching storm). Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the storm's transformation—while poetic, the exact mechanism of how empathy quiets meteorological chaos remains opaque.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes creates immediate atmospheric pressure, with vivid details like "branches heavy with frost" and "ice groaning beneath the lighthouse's foundation." The vintage mirrors function as micro-setting that directly enables the central action. The aurora's presence and its effect on Elara's skin grounds the fantastical elements. Minor deduction for the attic's sudden appearance without earlier spatial anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—quieting a fear-storm through empathy—is signaled early and pressure builds through the mirror sequence. Each vision (sailor, mother, lover) tightens the emotional accumulation toward transformation. However, the resolution lacks a clear trade-off or foreclosed option; Elara succeeds without visible personal cost beyond the effort of weaving empathy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of transforming collective fear through shared humanity emerges organically from the mirror visions without explicit moralizing. The final image of Elara giving the storm "a heart" resonates as a non-literal answer to handling fear. Subtext operates well through the fragment's evolution from broken to glowing. Slight deduction for the somewhat pat transformation of each tragic vision into positive abstractions (terror→resilience, clutch→love's strength).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature with Elara moving "as if she were a part of the landscape itself" and selective attention to the aurora's effects. The prose modulates effectively between lyrical description and tighter action during the mirror sequence. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that strays from character voice ("manifestation of collective fear").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in the mirror sequence's parallel structure. Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple story elements. However, abstract phrasing like "mapping empathy onto action" and "reconstitute the fragment's power" creates opacity. Some redundancy in explaining the storm as both "collective fear" and later needing empathy to quiet it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The concept of using salvaged mirrors to gather past empathy and transform a fear-storm is genuinely fresh. The specific detail of Elara's aurora-touched skin and the lighthouse orchard setting create memorable particulars. The transformation of each tragic vision into strength shows thoughtful engagement with the empathy theme. Deduction for the somewhat familiar "magical keeper protects community" framework underlying the innovation.</comment>
