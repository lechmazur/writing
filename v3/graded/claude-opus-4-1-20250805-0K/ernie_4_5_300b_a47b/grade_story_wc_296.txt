<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her internal conflict between guardedness and the need to "unbend" creates genuine tension. The resolution where she accepts her capacity for violence feels earned through the vision sequence. However, the emotional progression relies on abstract statements ("her heart lighter") rather than embodied sensation, and the epiphany about self-defense versus guilt could use more concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the vortex sequence building toward Mira's acceptance of her buried memory. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration as she reframes her guilt, with cost visible in "the strength to carry it." The who/where/when anchors establish clearly in the opening paragraph. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution where the plant seed reveals exactly what's needed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The swirling vortex and orchard create vivid atmosphere with "trees twisted like dancers" and sensory details of "decaying fruit and ozone." The setting actively constrains choice as Mira must enter the vortex to find answers. However, the cursed lake's specific properties remain vague beyond churning water, and the spatial choreography during the vortex sequence lacks clear anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering hidden truths about herself—escalates through the vortex pulling her in, the seed's release, and the vision's revelation. Cost is visible in confronting the buried memory of killing someone. The tension builds adequately through "expanding circles" of consciousness, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily once the seed does its work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme of confronting hidden darkness emerges through concrete action rather than statement, particularly in "discover what mirrors don't show." The final acceptance that she's "capable of violence, of darkness" offers complexity. However, the resolution that frames the killing as pure self-defense with misplaced guilt simplifies the moral ambiguity initially promised.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency with nature-focused imagery fitting a druid's perspective ("bark-rough hands," organic metaphors). POV remains stable in close third. Some filter phrases ("She saw herself," "Mira waited") slightly dull immediacy during key moments, and the prose occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("warlike serenity") that doesn't fully match Mira's established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose flows adequately with varied sentence structures and some strong images. Several instances of telling over showing weaken momentum: "her heart lighter than it had been in years" and "the memory had been buried, erased by her own magic." Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("chest tightened," "breath steady"). The final paragraph contains unnecessary philosophical summary about "lost things worth keeping."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept of a druid confronting buried memories through magical means offers a competent fantasy framework. The flesh-eating plant seed that seeks truth rather than food provides a modest twist. However, the resolution follows predictable patterns—traumatic memory recovered, guilt resolved through recontextualization—without surprising insight or transformation of the premise.</comment>
