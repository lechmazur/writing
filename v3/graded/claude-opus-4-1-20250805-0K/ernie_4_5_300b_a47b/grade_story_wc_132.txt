I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through pattern recognition, metaphorical layering, and density increase toward Eleanor's realization about control and transformation.

<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eleanor's internal shift from control to release is earned through concrete observation of the hellebore's metamorphosis, with embodied reactions ("pulse quickened," "breath held"). The contradiction between her desire to control and need to release plays out in scene. Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated final insight about transformation that edges toward thesis-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Eleanor's stance shift from controlling to listening) with visible cost - she must abandon years of methodology. The accumulative lens holds as plant observations build toward reweighting her approach. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Slight deduction for the somewhat explicit thematic articulation in dialogue near the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse environment and weather actively constrain choices - the storm brings the vines, the hellebore's retraction happens in specific conditions. The trellis and moss function as micro-settings that charge the final image of transformation. Strong sensory work ("steamy," "thick with chlorophyll") filtered through Eleanor's professional lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Eleanor's need to control vs. plants' need for autonomy) signals early and deepens through the hellebore's metamorphosis. The tightening occurs when Mara stops Eleanor from touching - forcing her to confront her controlling nature. Cost is visible as Eleanor releases decades of methodology, though the resolution feels slightly neat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete plant behaviors rather than abstraction - the hellebore's "circuitously sincere" transformation teaches without preaching until the final exchanges. The linden leaf serves as a returning image that accumulates meaning. Minor deduction for Eleanor's slightly too-articulate thematic statements to Mara that edge toward author intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature through botanical attention and scientific framing ("retraction," "metamorphosis," "chlorophyll"). Dialogue between Eleanor and Mara feels natural with appropriate subtext about control. Some filter verb accumulation ("She thought of," "She'd built") slightly dulls immediacy in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful botanical vocabulary. Information density is good - most sentences advance both external observation and internal realization. Deductions for repetitive "She'd [verb]" constructions in paragraph 6, and some paraphrase loops around the control/release theme that restate without adding pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of plants teaching humans about transformation through "circuitously sincere" metamorphosis offers a fresh angle on the familiar growth metaphor. The specific botanical details (hellebore retraction, linden leaf resilience) ground the abstraction. However, the control-to-release arc follows a somewhat predictable trajectory once established.</comment>
