<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation crystallizes through concrete particulars (father's pillbox, dream memory), and her internal conflict between paranoia and trust plays out in embodied hesitation at the bluff. The resolution—rekindling courage rather than finding answers—is earned through accumulated detail, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("the cost of secrets—the way they festered").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as memories and symbolic details (pillbox, codes, mist) layer toward Mara's stance crystallization about courage being rekindled rather than unearthed. Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost ("her steps lighter, her resolve steadier"), though the final paragraph's explicit thematic statement ("The bluff had given her a gift: not the truth, but the courage to seek it") weakens the resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bluff's physical properties—mist muffling footsteps, isolation preventing eavesdropping, earth accepting temporary ink tattoos—directly enable Mara's clandestine work. Setting constrains choice through the cliff edge's void "mirroring her own uncertainties" and charges the final image with "silver hush" returning as protective atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through textural layering (memories surface, wind plays tricks, mist parts) rather than causal escalation, fitting the accumulative lens. The dominant stake—reclaiming courage—tightens once when Mara commits to transcribing despite paranoia, though cost remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (pillbox spirals, codes bleeding into earth) with the father's "unused courage" motif earning its final reweighting. However, the ending's explicit articulation ("The bluff had given her a gift: not the truth, but the courage to seek it") and earlier abstract statements about secrets festering detract from organic emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through spy-specific awareness ("read the silence between heartbeats," paranoia keeping her alive) with controlled modulation during memory sequences. Voice maintains consistency through literary register appropriate to the character, though some phrases edge toward writerly display ("liminal space," "benediction").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (setting as emotional mirror, actions revealing character). Some overwriting appears in figurative density ("mist clinging...like a second skin," "silver hush," "fraying at the edges" clustered early) and occasional abstraction ("the way truth revealed itself in layers"), but momentum sustains through varied syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The burned spy's relationship to inherited codes and the bluff as confession site offers a specific angle on trust-after-betrayal. The transformation of "unused courage" from relic to rekindled flame provides fresh inflection, though the premise of decoding a parent's final message carries familiar resonances.</comment>
