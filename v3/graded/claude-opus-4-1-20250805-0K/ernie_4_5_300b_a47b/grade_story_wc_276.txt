<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's cool-headed focus and scientific-spiritual duality drive consistent choices through pressure, with his final acceptance of the goddess's dissolution showing earned renunciation with visible cost. The "voicing the right silence" paradox and years of meditation ground his capability, though internal contradiction could be more embodied during the peak moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the goddess dissolves into the garden, stabilizing the constellations at clear cost. The rail spike as conductor, the frequency translations, and the final pure tone create coherent causality, though the cost could be more viscerally felt in Kael's body.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden brilliantly constrains choice through its resonant flora, crystal trees as tuning forks, and moss that converts footsteps to visual ripples—all actively shaping Kael's approach to catching the goddess. The rail spike's vibrations creating visible zigzag patterns and the garden's final stabilization show environment as essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through the garden's increasing dissonance, Kael's deliberate spike strikes creating different resonances, to the goddess's manifestation and dissolution—each step narrowing options under the textural lens. The cost of losing the goddess to save the constellations is clear, though the middle could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The goddess as broken pattern, the sleepwalking constellations as emotional overflow, and Kael's role as "scientist and supplicant" create layered meaning without stating themes. The final pure tone after dissolution suggests continuity through transformation, earning its resonance through accumulated particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive voice balances technical precision ("frequency emitter," "transliterate emotions") with lyrical imagery ("lullaby sung by wolves"), maintaining Kael's scientific-mystical perspective throughout. Some filter verbs in observation sections slightly dull immediacy but don't compromise the closure's impact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong sensory integration and information density, particularly in the garden descriptions and spike vibrations creating visible patterns. Minor repetition in "the goddess" references and some scaffolding around "he realized" constructions, but prose accelerates effectively toward the crystalline final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound-as-visible-light garden, emotion-translating technology, and sleepwalking constellations creates a fresh cosmology that feels inevitable. The rail spike as both industrial relic and mystical conductor, plus "voicing the right silence" paradox, show genuine imaginative risk that heightens stakes.</comment>
