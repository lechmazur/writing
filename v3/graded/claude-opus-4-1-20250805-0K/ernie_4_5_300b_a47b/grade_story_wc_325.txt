<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's claustrophobia creates genuine internal contradiction as she forces herself deeper into the facility, with embodied panic ("breath came in shallow gasps," "walls seemed to press in"). The final choice to wade toward exit while clutching the codex shows clear values hierarchy with visible emotional cost ("tears blurred her vision"). However, the brother's backstory feels slightly convenient as motivation, and some emotional beats lean toward summary rather than full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through discovery of the codex, activation of machines, and holographic revelation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira finds proof of her brother's existence preserved in the cables—a conceptual shift that reweights the entire search with emotional cost ("tears blurred her vision"). The orientation anchors (research facility, Lira, post-tide window) establish clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical resolution of the gold fleck's function.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The facility's flooding/draining cycle creates immediate physical pressure that drives pacing, with water rising progressively constraining choices. Sensory details effectively layer ("air...tasted of rust and salt," "moss-slicked concrete"). The underwater cables as memorial network charges the final image meaningfully. Setting actively shapes the story's urgency and resolution, though some descriptions remain functional rather than fully lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving her brother existed beyond a single bubble—establishes early and tightens through rising water that forces immediate action. The tide's turn creates genuine time pressure that narrows options progressively. Cost is visible when Lira must abandon the facility despite her discovery, choosing preservation of proof over further exploration. The escalation follows the accumulative lens coherently, though the final physical escape feels slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that invisible things (lost people) leave electromagnetic traces—a non-literal answer to the opening question about tracking the invisible. The cables-as-memorials concept offers genuine resonance without stating a moral. However, the phase transitions concept feels somewhat grafted rather than fully integrated, and the brother subplot introduces slight thematic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature emerges through Lira's specific way of noticing ("skeletal map of dried seaweed," "star trapped in amber"). Voice maintains consistency through technical observations filtered by emotional urgency. Some register elevation occurs in explanatory passages ("electromagnetic field") that slightly strains the established voice. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves solid clarity with moments of strong imagery ("star trapped in amber," "etching the unremembered into the ocean's skin"). Information density generally high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("crashing hush" appears twice), some filter-verb clustering ("She remembered," "she noticed," "she realized"), and mild register drift in technical explanations that don't fully match Lira's voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The underwater cables as memorial network offers a fresh conceptual angle on loss and technological preservation. Lira's claustrophobia driving her into confined spaces creates character-specific tension. The phase transitions element feels less organic, reading more as imposed concept than inevitable discovery. The emotional resolution—finding electromagnetic proof rather than the person—shows some originality within familiar lost-relative territory.</comment>
