I'll evaluate this story as a demanding literary editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story operates through because/therefore linkages as Elara discovers her father's legacy, leading to her decision to continue his work.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes believably from discovery to action, with the father's letters providing causal weight. However, the emotional response to world-altering revelation feels understated - she "trembles" then immediately strategizes, missing the contradictory impulses that would make this discovery land with full psychological complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with Elara's decision to continue the revolutionary work, shown through the planted fortune and its immediate effect on the dockworker. The causal chain from discovery to action to consequence is clear, though the cost remains somewhat abstract - we see change initiated but not what Elara sacrifices or risks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting constrains and enables perfectly - its isolation allows manipulation, the basement holds secrets, the tower provides surveillance. Sensory details like "damp earth and old secrets" ground us, and the storm intensifies at the right moments to mirror internal pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to world-changing responsibility as Elara discovers her fortunes are "keys" in a larger design. The dominant stake - whether to continue her father's work - tightens when she realizes she's already been unconsciously participating, though the immediate cost of her choice remains unclear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of "open secrets" and hidden influence elegantly emerges through concrete action - fortunes as keys, the lighthouse as surveillance post, truth "hidden in plain sight." The final image of the dockworker finding his fortune while Elara watches resonantly answers the question of individual agency in larger designs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled metaphors ("carved through fog like a silver blade") and character-specific perception. The POV holds steady through third-limited, though some passages drift toward omniscient summary ("Her fortunes were never random") without sufficient grounding in Elara's immediate perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied syntax and strong imagery, particularly in atmospheric passages. Some overwriting appears ("slow-burn revolution," "roots twisting through governments and hearts") and the phrase "The game was afoot" feels derivative, but overall the line-level craft serves the story's aims with good momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fortune-cookie-writer-as-spymaster premise offers a fresh angle on influence networks, and the lighthouse setting as inherited spy station adds specificity. However, the revelation structure follows familiar patterns, and Elara's acceptance of her role lacks the messy complexity that would elevate this beyond competent genre execution.</comment>
