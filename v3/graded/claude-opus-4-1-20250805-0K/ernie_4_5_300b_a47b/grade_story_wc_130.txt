<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation rooted in ambiguous loss drives concrete choices throughout, with embodied grief ("tears mixing with sap"). The ritual with glass eyes shows contradictory impulses—seeking answers while accepting uncertainty. Minor deduction for slight therapy-speak ("mathematics of emotion") but the final realization about preservation as flow rather than freezing earns the closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through mosaic/fractal imagery toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara accepts loss as "alive, constantly reshaping." Cost is visible in tears and the choice to let memory flow rather than freeze. Slight deduction for extended reflection (brother's wisdom) that verges on 30% but remains anchored to present ritual and alters her stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cavern orchard with dripping stalactites and starlight fruit creates a unique magical-real space that constrains the ritual (mosaic stone placement, luminescent sap). The glass eyes' chips aligning with stone cracks uses micro-setting to drive the climactic revelation. Setting directly enables the transformation and charges the final image of flow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on solving the emotional riddle of brother's disappearance through the glass eyes. Escalation occurs as ritual reveals brother's presence "as a current in the air" forcing Elara to choose between preservation-as-freezing versus preservation-as-flow. Cost visible in accepting perpetual reshaping rather than closure, though pressure could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of grief as fractal/mosaic emerges through concrete imagery (chipped glass, cracked stone) rather than statement. The brother's quoted wisdom about emotion as mosaic pays off when Elara realizes "absence nourished growth." Final insight about preservation-as-flow reweights all prior attempts at conjuring without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with controlled mystical register ("shimmered like liquid starlight") maintains consistency. Perceptual signature shows through mathematical/pattern-seeking focus. Minor repetition of "fractal" and some elevated diction in emotional peaks ("ethereal blue") but rhythm modulates effectively with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. Deductions for template phrases ("tears mixing with," "fingers trembling"), some filter constructions ("she saw it," "she felt"), and mild overwriting in figurative density during the ritual sequence. Information density high but occasional redundancy ("secretive conjurer" restated as concept).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-as-mathematics with cavern magic and taxidermy preservation creates non-obvious angle. The fractal/mosaic metaphor for loss transforms familiar grief narrative. Specific details (glass eye chips, luminescent sap ritual) avoid generic templates though emotional arc itself follows recognizable pattern.</comment>
