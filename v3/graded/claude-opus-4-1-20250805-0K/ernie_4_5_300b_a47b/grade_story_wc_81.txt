<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to find truth about the sunken city is clear and drives meaningful choices, particularly when she discovers Elara's journal revealing collective denial sank the city. The transformation from cataloger seeking order to truth-bearer with purpose lands with visible cost. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("reclaimed stillness," "dappled resolve") that occasionally dulls embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: blackout leads to exploration, stamp discovery enables vault access, journal reveals truth that reweights Lira's purpose. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira accepts the burden of sharing difficult truth, with cost visible in "heavy" truth and long swim home. The owl stamp's transformation from order-ritual to vigilance symbol charges the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken library setting directly constrains choices through darkness, water, and hidden vault requiring the stamp to access. Bioluminescent algae, bronze door grooves, and slick algae-covered stairs create tactile specificity. The preserved dry chamber contrasts effectively with the flooded library, and moonlight filtering through cracked skylights guides movement and discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from cataloging knowledge to uncovering buried truth to accepting responsibility for sharing it. The vault discovery tightens pressure, and finding Elara's journal forces Lira to confront the city's self-destruction through lies. Cost is visible in the "heavy" truth and isolation of the long swim home, though the final confrontation could press harder.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through discovery: societies destroy themselves through denial of truth. The parallel between the sunken city's fate and potential repetition above creates resonance without moralizing. The owl stamp's evolution from order-symbol to vigilance-marker and the final line "Some darknesses, once faced, become light" offer non-literal answers to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, though occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve") that strains against the pragmatic cataloger POV. Perceptual signature emerges through Lira's methodical observation and physical interaction with texts. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose generally clean with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts between exploration and discovery. Some overwriting in figurative language ("blackout crept through...like a thief," "swallowing the last flicker") and abstract compounds ("reclaimed stillness," "dappled resolve") that occasionally slow momentum. Information density adequate but could tighten further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sunken library as truth-vault offers fresh angle on post-apocalyptic exploration, avoiding action-adventure tropes for quieter archaeological discovery. The civilization destroyed by willful denial rather than disaster provides specificity. However, the truth-seeker-finds-hidden-knowledge arc follows familiar patterns without significant transformation.</comment>
