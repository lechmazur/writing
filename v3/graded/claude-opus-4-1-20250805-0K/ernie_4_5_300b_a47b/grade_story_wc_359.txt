I'll evaluate this story systematically under the rubric's demanding standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered sensory descriptions and symbolic resonance, with the ice cavern's transformation serving as the dominant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's synesthetic gift drives concrete choices (singing colors into ice), and her internal experience is consistently embodied. However, Veyra's conversion feels too swift - his shift from skeptic to believer lacks intermediate resistance that would deepen the character arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the cavern's transformation from "sculpted hush" to living hymn, with clear cost (Lira's physical exertion, Veyra's worldview shift). The accumulative lens holds throughout, building density through color/sound layering toward the final harmonious state.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ice cavern functions as both setting and participant - its walls shift from constraint to instrument. Sensory detail is exceptionally filtered through Lira's synesthetic POV ("sound bloomed as color"), and the aurora actively shapes her method, constraining how she must work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulation: silence pools → song seeps → cavern shifts → sculptor transforms. The dominant stake (proving wonder essential) deepens through cascading sensory effects, though the lack of meaningful resistance from Veyra slightly weakens the pressure trajectory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "sculpted hush" into living song - wonder proven essential through action, not declaration. The final image of harmonious oscillation between "repose and revelation" offers a non-literal answer, though Lira's explicit "truth is essential" line edges toward over-articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lira's synesthetic perception creates a distinct voice ("silence pooled like indigo ink"), with consistent focalization. Dialogue carries appropriate subtext and character distinction, though Veyra's voice could differentiate more sharply from Lira's register in places.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose shows strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures, with high information density in descriptive passages. Some figurative density in peak moments ("frost spiraled like ghostly breath," "sculpted hush made flesh") risks over-ornamentation, and occasional template phrases ("reached out," "stepped inside") could be more specific.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synesthetic bell-ringer concept offers genuine freshness, transforming the familiar artist-proves-beauty-matters arc through specific sensory logic. The ice cavern as responsive instrument and the color-as-sound mechanics create an internally consistent magical system that feels earned.</comment>
