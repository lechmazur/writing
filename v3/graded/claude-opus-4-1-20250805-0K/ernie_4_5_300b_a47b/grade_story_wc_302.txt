I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor at a prestigious literary publication, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered descriptions of the library's glow, the cipher pattern, and sensory details that accumulate toward the discovery of the unspoken words.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and her interiority shows consistent purpose, though internal conflict remains mostly told ("sharp and restless" eyes) rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The final discovery moment earns its resolution through prior pattern-seeking, but peak emotional complexity stays somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres as Lira decodes the propagation delays into a pattern that reveals the hidden books. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration when she finds the library of unspoken words, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt - "fear and excitement" doesn't fully convey what she's risked or lost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glowing library with its amber light and mist creates genuine atmosphere that shapes Lira's investigation method. The propagation delays in the light become both setting detail and plot mechanism, constraining how she must decode the cipher - a strong integration of environment with action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through pattern recognition as Lira moves from documenting delays to discovering the cyclical cipher to finding the specific shelf. The dominant stake (finding the library of unspoken words) tightens once when the pattern emerges, though agency remains primarily observational rather than forcing difficult trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of hidden truths emerges through the concrete image of words appearing only when held to light, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the concept of "unspoken words" and "truths humanity dared not voice" tends toward abstraction without specific human complexity to ground it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on light patterns and temporal anomalies fitting Lira's quest. Some register elevation appears ("ghostly serpents," "veiled dreamer") but generally serves the atmospheric tone without breaking POV plausibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between description and action. Minor repetition appears ("propagation delays" used 3x, "confidence man's watch" 4x) and some abstract phrasing ("the weight of time itself") but momentum generally holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The concept of a library containing unspoken truths offers moderate freshness, executed through the specific mechanism of light delays creating a decodable pattern. The backwards-moving watch as a key tool adds specificity, though the overall premise of mystical libraries holding secrets remains familiar territory.</comment>
