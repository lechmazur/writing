<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation as a mediator between living and dead is clear and consistent, driving him to weave truth carefully through dreams rather than direct revelation. The sailor's ghost's motivation—lingering from love rather than vengeance—provides strong emotional grounding. However, the three dream-receivers lack sufficient setup to feel inevitable as choices, and Kael's internal conflict remains understated when he could show more contradiction between duty and emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with three dream fragments building toward Kael's resolution to weave truth into the living's dreams. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where connections between living and dead are restored with emotional cost visible in each relationship. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph, and the pattern of dream analysis is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glacier shrine setting effectively constrains the ritual space, with candles creating atmosphere and the ice wall serving as a conduit for communion. The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting that shapes each dream interpretation. The final image of "borrowed starlight" guiding Kael's descent while shrine candles flare creates resonant closure, though middle sections could leverage more environmental pressure on choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—revealing the sailor's truth to heal fractured relationships—is signaled early and deepens through each dream revelation. The progression from child's innocence to son's guilt to widow's grief creates meaningful escalation under the accumulative lens. However, Kael faces no real opposition or cost to his gift; the resolution feels too smooth without visible price for bridging worlds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of windows as fragile connections requiring careful handling. The melted snow globe transforms meaning in each dream—pool, prison, mirror—building thematic resonance about love persisting beyond death. The ending avoids explicit moralizing, letting the image of reopened windows between worlds carry the weight, though the "salvaging something pure" arrives somewhat tidily.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with phrases like "candle-lit shrine casting flickering shadows that danced like ghosts" establishing atmosphere. POV control remains stable in close third, with Kael's perceptual signature evident in how he reads emotional currents in dreams. Some sentences drift toward purple prose ("rustle of wind through frozen reeds"), and the three dream sequences lack sufficient rhythmic variation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong imagery and atmospheric control, particularly in transitions between dreams and the framing glacier scenes. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. However, several metaphors strain ("windows of connection," "borrowed starlight") and some phrases loop conceptually ("fragile things...fragile, enduring threads"). The syntactic pattern of "The [ordinal] dream..." creates mechanical rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The concept of analyzing ghosts' secrets through strangers' dreams offers a fresh angle on the medium/ghost-whisperer trope. The specific constellation of three family members experiencing different guilt/loss adds originality. However, the resolution lacks risk—Kael succeeds without struggle or transformation, and the neat healing of all relationships feels safe rather than bold.</comment>
