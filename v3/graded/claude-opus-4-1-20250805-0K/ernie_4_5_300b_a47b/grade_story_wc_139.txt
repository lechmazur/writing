I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric's strict standards for immediate publishability.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation through the ink pot and father's teaching creates consistent character logic, with the "wait actively" philosophy driving her negotiation tactics. The transformation from hiding to confronting agents shows earned growth, though some emotional beats feel slightly performative ("bitter, metallic, like blood"). Internal conflict between fear and determination plays out through concrete actions rather than labels.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story achieves closure through Elara securing asylum papers (Decisive Change with visible cost), though the resolution feels somewhat convenient. Causality holds through the ink pot's abilities enabling her perception of agents' thoughts, leading to successful negotiation. The "wait actively" throughline connects opening teaching to final strategy. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two, but the fake body reveal and sudden negotiation success strain plausibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prep room setting with lilies, mahogany casket, and fluorescent lights creates adequate atmosphere, though details remain somewhat generic. The ink pot's color changes (violet for danger, gold for clarity) provide visual tracking of tension. Spatial choreography works when Elara steps from behind the casket, but the funeral home doesn't constrain choices as much as enable convenient confrontation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stakes center on protecting the mathematical formula and securing asylum, with escalation through the agents' arrival and gun-drawing. The reveal of the dummy body creates a reversal, though resolution through negotiation feels insufficiently pressured. Cost appears in trading the formula for safety, but the agents' quick capitulation undermines the established threat level.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "mathematics of equity" concept and fair trade theme emerge through plot events, though the final line's explicit statement ("make sure no one ever has to fake their death again") veers toward moralizing. The ink pot as a tool for understanding others' perspectives offers thematic resonance about empathy in negotiation. Subtext operates better in the father's cryptic teachings than in the somewhat transparent confrontation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency through Elara's twelve-year-old perspective, with appropriate observations like "crouched behind a mahogany casket." Dialogue differentiates characters adequately (agents' sneering, Harrow's protests, Elara's steady negotiation). Some phrases feel overwrought for the POV ("liquefying rigid thinking," "mathematics of equity"), creating occasional register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose generally maintains clarity and momentum, though some metaphorical language feels forced ("echo of a con artist's honest child"). The ink pot descriptions effectively track emotional beats through color changes. Minor redundancies appear ("waited actively—not passively, but alert"), and the final paragraph's summative quality weakens impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The con artist's child using deception tools for honest purposes offers a decent conceptual twist. The funeral home as negotiation site provides some freshness, though the magical realism element (ink granting thought-reading) feels somewhat convenient. The mathematical formula for economic equity concept remains abstract rather than grounded in specifics.</comment>
