<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and her aesthetic drive shapes actions, but internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—she experiences only wonder without genuine struggle. The final choice to step into the unknown lacks earned cost; we see transformation without resistance or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with density increase toward dissolution of boundaries. However, closure lacks visible cost—Lirael reshapes reality without price, making the transformation feel unearned. The "tremor of certainty" repetition provides structure but the final step "into the unknown" doesn't reconfigure stakes with legible consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium and humming quartz colonnade create vivid, purposeful atmosphere that constrains and enables Lirael's transformation. The setting actively participates through the colonnade's song merging with her voice and the ice parting, though these transformations could pressure choice more directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract—"dissolution of boundaries" and "the sacred and profane might blur"—without concrete opposition or cost. Lirael achieves her goal of reshaping reality but faces no resistance; the world simply yields to her will. No meaningful tightening occurs under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries dissolving emerges through concrete imagery (ice parting, stone rippling) rather than statement. However, the transformation lacks complexity—boundaries dissolve without examining what is lost, making the thematic resolution feel one-sided.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyric consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("lantern-moth hush," "liquid glass"). However, register occasionally drifts elevated beyond Lirael's established lexicon ("the sacred and the profane"), and no dialogue tests character distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of vivid imagery but suffers from paraphrase loops ("tremor of certainty" appears twice identically, "dissolution of boundaries"/"boundaries began to dissolve"). Abstract phrasing like "the sacred and the profane" and "something unnameable" weakens specificity in key beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cloud-shadow poet who reshapes reality through paraphrase offers a fresh angle, and the humming quartz colonnade as living poem shows originality. However, the transformation-without-cost resolution follows a familiar template of artistic transcendence.</comment>
