<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's retrocognitive gift creates genuine internal conflict between past visions and present despair, with embodied emotional progression through bleeding fingers and bone-deep vibrations. The final choice to train new custodians shows earned transformation from solitary hope to communal rebuilding, though some passages lean toward emotional summary ("gaunt and wary") rather than fully embodied states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where rekindling the beacon transforms from literal ship-guidance to metaphorical hope-sustaining, with visible cost in Elara's bleeding hands and years of solitary work. The accumulative lens holds as density builds from shard-handling through alignment attempts to final communal gathering, though the seventh-night breakthrough feels slightly convenient despite prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass pavilion functions as active setting that constrains choices (shattered panes limit access, mosaic floor guides alignment) and enables the climactic resonance. Sensory hierarchy effectively narrows during crisis moments to tactile glass-handling and vibrations, though some descriptions drift toward the ornamental ("poisoned seas" never constrains action).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as failed attempts compound into bleeding fingers and storm-threatened work, with the dominant stake (proving meaning exists in chaos) tightening when moonlight finally refracts. The cost is legible in physical toll and years surrendered, though the storm's arrival could feel less coincidental.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the transformed meaning of the beacon—from literal navigation to existential hope—with the prism's shards becoming a concrete metaphor for reconstructing meaning from fragments. The final image of incomplete star return with sufficient hope resonates without stating its moral, earning its wisdom through Elara's specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signature in how Elara experiences retrocognitive visions as flooding sensations and physical vibrations. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("fragile alchemy of hope and memory") that strains against the otherwise grounded voice, and dialogue remains minimal, limiting character distinction opportunities.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though several template-cadence runs appear ("She saw...She showed...She spoke"). Mixed metaphors occasionally muddle clarity ("threads to follow—constellations to track, shards to piece together" conflates three vehicles), and some passages lean toward purple prose without clear POV justification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The retrocognitive gift offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic reconstruction, transforming the beacon's purpose from practical to existential in an earned reversal. While the collapse-by-silence concept intrigues, execution sometimes relies on familiar post-apocalyptic beats (lone survivor, ancient technology, gathering community).</comment>
