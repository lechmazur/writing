I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and metaphor toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than strict causal linkage.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Herald's characterization succeeds through concrete, embodied details—her laughter "like wind chimes in a hurricane" and her mastery of the lantern's prophetic angles. Her choice to embrace both light and dark in shaping the dawn carries genuine cost. However, the internal conflict could be more viscerally dramatized; we see her determination but not enough contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the Herald crystallizes her role as "keeper of the flame, steward of shadows" with the dawn as both temporal and metaphysical choice. The accumulative build through shadow-visions to final acceptance works well. Cost is present but could be more visceral; we feel the weight of responsibility but not what she sacrifices to bear it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting functions as more than backdrop—its glass panels, circular balcony, and cliff-edge position all constrain and enable the Herald's prophetic work. The interplay of light, shadow, and physical space (especially "total internal reflection") directly shapes her ability to glimpse and steer the future. Sensory details like the "wind tugging at her cloak" and "ocean roared...like restless gods" create lived-in atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal routine to world-shaping responsibility as the shadows reveal "a new dawn...different. Heavier." The progression from adjusting the wick to confronting living shadows to accepting both light and dark provides meaningful deepening. However, the final choice lacks a sharper trade-off; we understand she accepts responsibility but not what specific path she forecloses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of ancient methods and future-shaping, crystallizing in "the dawn wasn't just a time of day. It was a choice." The story resists simple binaries, embracing that "light and dark were twins, inseparable." The final image of the lighthouse as beacon reweights all prior shadow-work without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent mythic-contemporary register with distinctive touches like "accidentally discovered its prophetic nature" and "total internal reflection." The perceptual signature—focusing on light, shadow, and prophetic fragments—stays coherent. Minor weakness: some moments edge toward overwrought ("restless gods"), though this mostly serves the heightened tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("liquid night," "electric" shadows) and one instance of telling that could be shown ("She'd always known her role was small").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fusion of lighthouse-keeper tradition with prophetic shadow-reading offers fresh specificity. The concept of "total internal reflection" as both physical and metaphysical technique shows originality. While lighthouse-as-beacon is familiar, the execution through shadow-prophecy and the Herald's specific characterization elevates it beyond template.</comment>
