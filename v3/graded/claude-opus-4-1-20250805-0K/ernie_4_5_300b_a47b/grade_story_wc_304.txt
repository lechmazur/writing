<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and embodied through precise actions—her trembling fingers, synchronized breathing with aurora pulses—though internal contradiction remains understated. The cost of her work manifests physically (exhaustion) and emotionally (finding "strange peace" in preserving echoes against oblivion). Minor deduction for the slightly abstract handling of Elion's essence, which lists qualities rather than embodying them through specific memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Lirael's successful preservation and the threshold returning to stillness—"a canvas, waiting for the next artist." The accumulative lens holds as density increases through the ritual's stages, with visible cost in the pool's near-destruction and Lirael's exhaustion. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (grotto, Lirael's role, the emerald chip).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The grotto setting directly constrains choices—the pool's fragility forces Lirael to innovate with moonlight symbols and lullaby. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "liquid starlight," "obsidian shards etched with runes," bioluminescent moss. The threshold of stillness functions as micro-setting that shapes the entire ritual and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the chip's dimming light, then the pool's cracking surface threatening all preserved echoes. Lirael's agency drives resolution through her unconventional "embellishment" technique. Cost is visible in the pool's near-destruction and her physical exhaustion, though the tightening could be sharper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and oblivion, crystallizing in "even in the face of oblivion, beauty could endure." The threshold as both barrier and lens deepens thematic resonance. The final image of stillness as "a canvas, waiting" offers a non-literal answer about creative persistence against entropy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm—"her voice a whisper swallowed by the radiant hush." POV remains stable in close third. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("latent magic," "pure potentiality") that slightly exceeds character lexicon during action beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"adjusted her silver spectacles and studied the emerald chip" establishes character, action, and focus object. Some figurative density in peak beats ("mirror to the cosmos," "threads through a loom") without clear payoff. Template cadence appears briefly ("She realized... She had to act fast").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The beautician-mortician hybrid role for celestials offers fresh specificity, as does the technical process of echo preservation. The threshold functioning as both barrier and amplifying lens adds conceptual originality. Transformation of familiar fantasy elements (aurora, grotto) through specific occupational detail elevates beyond template.</comment>
