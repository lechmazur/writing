I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lila's motivation through grief and PTSD is clear and embodied through concrete actions like the photograph ritual and somatic grounding exercises. The internal conflict between holding onto trauma versus finding peace plays out through micro-choices, though Mrs. Voss's wisdom occasionally veers toward therapy-speak ("Your body remembers what your mind tries to forget"). The final choice to anchor optimism feels earned through the accumulated somatic work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through somatic markers building toward Lila's Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The cost is visible in her acceptance that "Elias was gone, but the love they'd shared wasn't erased." Opening orientation is clear (arboretum, cliff, morning ritual), and the closure lands with her walking home "the pearl of stillness cradled in her chest."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The arboretum setting actively constrains and enables choices—the stone bench becomes a grounding tool, the cliff edge suggests danger, the abandoned state mirrors Lila's isolation. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("wind-twisted pines and salt-bleached roses," "boots crunching gravel"). The setting functions as more than backdrop, becoming integral to the somatic practice that drives the story.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding peace after trauma—is clear from the opening, with one meaningful deepening when Lila moves from scoffing at somatic markers to actively using them. The cost appears in her acceptance of loss without erasure. However, Mrs. Voss's arrival lacks tension, and the conflict remains largely internal without significant external pressure beyond the initial trauma.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The theme of anchoring optimism in realism emerges through concrete details rather than abstraction, particularly in the final realization that beauty exists "in the brokenness." The pearl of stillness metaphor accumulates meaning through physical grounding. However, Mrs. Voss articulates the theme too directly at times ("That's why you anchor it in realism"), though the final image successfully reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with selective perception filtered through Lila's trauma-affected consciousness. Diction matches her artistic background ("painting wedding invitations," "bold and sure" strokes). Mrs. Voss's dialogue carries distinct wisdom-elder cadence. Some filter verbs appear but serve the dissociative PTSD experience ("she'd begun to believe").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts between calm observation and traumatic flashback. Information density is moderate—most lines advance character or atmosphere. Some redundancy appears in the somatic marker explanations, and occasional elevated diction ("perched," "mossy walls") slightly exceeds necessity, but no major loops or scaffolding interfere with momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The somatic markers approach to trauma recovery offers a specific angle on grief narratives, though the wise elder guide is familiar. The pearl of stillness concept provides fresh framing for peace-seeking. The drone strike wedding detail is unusual and specific. However, the resolution follows expected therapeutic progress patterns without significant transformation of the healing narrative template.</comment>
