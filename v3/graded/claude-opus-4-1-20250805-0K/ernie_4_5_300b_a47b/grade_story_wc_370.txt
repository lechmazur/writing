<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eleanor's compassionate recluse nature drives genuine internal conflict between hiding and revelation, with embodied emotion ("tears prickled her eyes") and specific micro-choices. The final realization that "hiding wasn't about retreat—it was about choosing when to reveal herself" represents earned character insight with visible emotional cost, though some interior phrasing edges toward therapy-speak ("reconcile her grief").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Eleanor's acceptance that hiding is selective revelation, with clear cost in confronting her mother's letters and choosing to stay. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward the final image of Eleanor cradled with letters, though the orientation anchors arrive slightly late (~150 words for full clarity of the society's nature).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hidden library setting constrains Eleanor's choices through specific details like the password requirement and mirror chamber, with vivid sensory work ("candlelight flickered in perpetual twilight"). The Third Shelf functions as micro-setting that directly enables closure through the mother's letters, though some descriptions lean generic ("vaulted ceilings veiled in dust").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from Eleanor's initial impulse to hide toward the confrontation with her mother's letters, with clear cost in facing "what you bring" to the blank book. The mirror chamber showing alternate selves deepens pressure effectively, though the resolution relies somewhat on discovered wisdom rather than Eleanor's active choice under maximum pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the paradox of hiding while being seen, with the blank book and mirrors serving as concrete vehicles for abstract concepts. The final insight about selective revelation resonates without moralizing, though the leader's statement "Wisdom lies in mistakes" edges toward explicit theme articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent close-third POV with distinctive touches like "pulsed in her mind" and selective perception filtered through grief. Dialogue carries appropriate formality for the secret society setting with subtext, though some interior moments drift toward elevated register ("enlarged tranquility wrapped around her like a cloak") that slightly exceeds Eleanor's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves solid clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between reflection and scene. Some figurative language feels forced ("invitation's gold filigree...like a secret too heavy to announce") and occasional redundancy appears ("forgotten relic" followed by explaining locked doors), but the closing image lands cleanly without loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The secret society premise offers a competent but familiar frame for grief exploration, with the blank book showing "what you bring" as the freshest element. The mirror chamber showing alternate selves and the mother's posthumous letters follow expected patterns, though specific details like "nestled paradoxes" password add modest distinction.</comment>
