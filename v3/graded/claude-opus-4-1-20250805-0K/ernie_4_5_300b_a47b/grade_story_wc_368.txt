<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lin's transformation from cautious observer to active illuminator of stories is well-motivated through the donor heart premise and the blue morpho wing catalyst. Her internal contradiction between wanting to understand story magnetism while fearing its power creates genuine tension. The final choice to dedicate herself to drawing out stories shows clear character evolution with visible cost (the wing's loss).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Lin's crystallized understanding of her new purpose, with the donor heart serving as both literal and metaphorical transformation. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and observations build toward Lin's realization about illuminating stories. Cost is felt through the wing's disappearance and Lin's acceptance of her role as story-keeper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating tea house setting constrains and enables choices effectively—its elevation above the mist creates isolation for contemplation while the obsidian stones' interaction with light drives Lin's sun-tracking methodology. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, particularly the light effects and mist imagery that mirror Lin's evolving perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding what makes people magnetize stories—intensifies through Lin's heightened post-surgery perception and the wing's dramatic light display. The escalation from private observation to witnessing shared story connection provides meaningful deepening. However, the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off or more visceral cost beyond the wing's loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of light, perception, and story-telling without explicit moralizing. The blue morpho wing's transformation from talisman to beacon effectively embodies the theme of stories as both dangerous and necessary. The ending's image of Lin preparing tea while holding stories resonates without stating its meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary elevation with controlled rhythm and selective perception that reflects Lin's watchful nature. The prose modulates effectively during the wing's light display, though some passages edge toward purple prose ("tiny, angry star"). POV remains stable with appropriate narrative distance for Lin's contemplative character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments but suffers from occasional overwriting ("quietly explosive," "iridescent caution") and metaphor density that borders on excessive. Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the story-magnetism concept. Line-level craft is competent but inconsistent, with some passages achieving lyrical beauty while others feel overwrought.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise of a heart transplant recipient gaining new perceptual abilities offers a fresh angle on the artist-observer archetype. The floating tea house setting and blue morpho wing create distinctive imagery. However, the story-magnetism concept feels somewhat abstract and the resolution somewhat predictable given the setup.</comment>
