grade_story_wc_62.txt
I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural - the story builds through layered visits, sensory details, and the gradual revelation of family grief patterns, culminating in Marlow's poem as a resonant reconfiguration.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marlow's motivation is clear and rooted in family tradition and personal loss, with concrete embodied details ("chisel-calloused hands"). The spectral voice feels underdeveloped as a pressure source. His final choice to write and read his poem shows earned change, though the internal conflict could act more simultaneously rather than sequentially.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Marlow's poem and decision to "carve a new gravestone...shaped not by loss, but by love," with visible cost in confronting unspoken losses. The accumulative structure coheres through nightly visits building to transformation. The spectral voice mechanism feels slightly convenient but doesn't break causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting actively shapes the narrative - glass panes rattle with "thundering calm," butterflies create living patterns, and the space holds family poems "woven into the vines." Setting constrains choices through its role as repository of grief. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("damp earth and forgotten roses").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake of discovering "the shape of collective grief" progresses through accumulative visits and family stories. The butterfly migration provides temporal pressure and symbolic weight. Cost becomes visible in Marlow's confrontation with his own unspoken losses, though the spectral mentorship reduces some agency in the middle section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the metaphor "Grief is not a hole, but a door" and the ribbon's shifting colors. The trading of poems as binding across time gains depth through dramatization. The final image of butterflies' flight lingering "in his bones" offers resonant closure without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm ("The ancient greenhouse at dusk hummed with the quiet electricity"). The spectral voice distinction could be stronger. Marlow's poem demonstrates voice under pressure, and perceptual signature shows in how he notices craft details and textures.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose shows strong moments ("shadows that danced like restless spirits") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing ("the shape of collective grief"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("each story was a thread in the ribbon, each poem a stone in the wall of grief"). Template cadence emerges in the family history catalog section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The spectral mentorship concept offers a fresh angle on grief exploration, though execution tends toward the expected. The butterfly migration as temporal frame and the greenhouse as living repository show originality. Marlow's specific profession as gravestone carver meaningfully connects to theme.</comment>
