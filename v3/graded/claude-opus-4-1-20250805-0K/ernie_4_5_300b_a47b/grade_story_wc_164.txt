<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, with concrete embodied details like "Her skin shimmered like tide-washed sand." The transliteration of emotions into physical sensations ("It felt like regret...like molasses left too long in the sun") shows specific characterization. However, the final realization about paths being "released" rather than forgotten feels somewhat unearned—there's insufficient dramatized struggle leading to this insight, and internal contradiction is told rather than shown in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through crater glass, seeds, and emotional transliteration toward a Conceptual Repricing ending. The closure lands with Lira's realization that "paths disappeared not because they were forgotten, but because they were *released*," which reweights the premise. However, the cost remains abstract—we see the truth but don't feel what Lira loses or sacrifices in accepting it, violating the cost proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The crystalline geode setting is vividly rendered with specific sensory details ("light fractured into prismatic whispers," "walls pulsed with a faint, bioluminescent glow"). The crater glass and seeds function as micro-settings that constrain Lira's investigation method. The pool of liquid light at the geode's center enables the final revelation, making environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early and maintains coherence. There's one meaningful deepening when the shard's regret "pulses" in response to the seed, changing Lira's understanding. However, escalation lacks protagonist agency; Lira mostly observes and conjectures rather than making choices with visible trade-offs, and the final revelation arrives through passive observation of the pool rather than earned pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of memory, loss, and letting go emerges organically through the concrete work with crater glass and disappeared paths. The paradox of "cheerful gloom" embodies thematic complexity about accepting loss. The final insight about releasing painful paths offers a non-literal answer to the central question, though it edges toward explicit thematic statement ("Holding onto them caused pain, so the world let them go").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with lyrical descriptions fitting a "sea-foam recollectionist" perspective. The perceptual signature shows in how Lira translates everything into emotional textures ("viscous...like molasses"). No dialogue to evaluate. Some filter verb accumulation ("she saw," "she felt," "she believed") dulls immediacy in middle sections without clear voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("light fractured into prismatic whispers") but suffers from repetitive structures. Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. The paraphrase loop "Why?" she whispered.../"But why?" she repeated adds little pressure. Information density is moderate—many sentences do single duty describing without advancing conflict.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of a recollectionist who transliterates emotions from volcanic glass offers fresh specificity. The synthesis of geological time (crater glass) with emotional archaeology feels non-obvious. However, the resolution about releasing painful memories, while earned through the story's logic, lands in somewhat familiar territory about letting go of trauma.</comment>
