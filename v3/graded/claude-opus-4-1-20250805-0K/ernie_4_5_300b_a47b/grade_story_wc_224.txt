I'll evaluate this story through the lens of a demanding literary editor, inferring the drive lens and assessing each category systematically.

**Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural** - The story builds through layered imagery and memory fragments toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lirael accepts her role as memory-bearer.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lirael's mercury-glass nature creates a compelling metaphor for memory absorption, with genuine internal conflict between forgetting's pain and remembering's burden. The transformation from avoidance to acceptance feels earned through accumulated pressure, though some interiority edges toward abstract ("the shape of home") rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lirael accepts bearing others' memories as her truth, with visible cost in the obsidian shards embedding in her skin. The accumulative structure coheres well, building from avoidance through mother's revelation to acceptance, though the cavern sequence briefly strains spatial logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore and mercury-glass body function as extended setting that constrains choice—Lirael's reflective skin makes her the "lock" to the stone's "key." Sensory details like "dust motes swirled like tiny galaxies" and "bioluminescent fungi" create atmosphere while the mountain location adds mythic scale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes build from personal need ("understand the shape of home") through mother's revelation to accepting a larger role as memory-weaver. The feather activation creates a decisive turn, though the cavern sequence with falling stones frozen into feathers stretches credibility slightly without sufficient grounding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between individual and collective memory, with "home" reconceived from place to "the act of remembering." The mercury-glass/lost language stone pairing creates resonant metaphor, though the final line about seeding truth edges toward explicit thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "shadows as sharp as knives" and controlled psychic distance. Mother's dialogue carries appropriate weight ("The stone isn't a map. It's a mirror"), though some passages lean toward elevated register that occasionally obscures immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("her mercury skin substituted reality, unraveling her dreams") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("labyrinthine bookstore occupying the entire mountain") and abstract phrasing. The cavern sequence contains logical leaps (stones becoming feathers) that strain clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The mercury-glass seer concept offers fresh take on memory and identity, with the lost language stone as living artifact whose symbols shift when unobserved. The synthesis of bookstore-as-mountain with memory-bearing protagonist creates distinctive world, though some elements feel assembled rather than inevitable.</comment>
