<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lila's phobia-ridden nature creates genuine internal conflict that drives choices, particularly in the confrontation with the enforcer where she uses her "fear of contact to fuel her agility." The transformation from vulnerability as weakness to vulnerability as "compass" and "power" earns its closure through concrete action, though some emotional transitions (mother's sudden appearance, instant reconciliation tone) feel slightly rushed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows a causal drive lens with clear because/therefore linkages from discovery to confrontation to resolution. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lila's relationship to vulnerability fundamentally shifts, with visible cost in confronting both enforcer and mother. However, the mother's survival revelation and the mob boss subplot resolution through news article feel mechanically convenient rather than dramatically earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "rusted library under stars" creates atmospheric pressure and provides functional space for discovery and confrontation. Specific details like "shelves groaned under the weight of decaying scripts" and genre-labeled aisles add texture. Yet the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain choices or shape tactics beyond providing hiding spots and throwable scripts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal identity crisis to physical danger to generational reconciliation, with the enforcer confrontation providing genuine pressure. Lila's agency drives the resolution through decrypting, confronting, and outwitting. The cost of inherited enemies and confronting her mother's betrayal registers, though the mob boss arrest happens too conveniently off-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically through action and image, from the whispering shell to Lila's phobias becoming tactical advantages. The final café scene offers resonant closure without explicit moralizing, though Lila's articulation "I proved vulnerability is power" edges toward theme-statement territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception filtered through Lila's fear-driven awareness ("boots echoed," "knees protesting"). Dialogue between Lila and enforcer carries subtext and advances plot. However, the mother's dialogue lacks distinction from Lila's register, and some interiority relies on telling ("firmly adaptive despite her fears").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose clarity suffers from repetitive structures ("She'd come here after," "She'd found it," "She knelt") and filter-heavy constructions. Template phrases like "trembling certainty" and "rough with emotion" lack specificity. The enforcer section contains multiple filter verbs ("she saw," "She recognized") that dull immediacy during peak tension.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The concept of inherited phobias as "genetic hand-me-downs" and "a map of her mother's betrayals" offers fresh perspective on familiar betrayal themes. Using vulnerability as tactical advantage during confrontation shows originality. However, the mob boss/stolen art subplot and convenient news resolution feel derivative of crime genre templates.</comment>
