I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's altruistic motivation is consistent but lacks internal contradiction or complexity. The ghost conceit creates distance from embodied emotion, and her actions follow a single track without genuine struggle or cost. The settlers function more as a collective than distinct individuals with competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based messaging building toward collective action. However, the closure lacks visible cost—the arch is simply "mended by collective will" without sacrifice or trade-off. The resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through dramatic pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating rock arches and pearl-fruited trees create a distinctive setting that directly constrains the conflict. The nebula of respite functions as both atmosphere and thematic anchor. However, the setting doesn't evolve with events, and spatial choreography during the repair sequence remains vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The crumbling arches establish stakes but escalation is minimal—settlers simply gather and fix the problem without meaningful obstacles or reversals. No concrete cost is paid; the "hours" of work lack specificity about trade-offs or sacrifice. The resolution arrives through collective effort without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The nebula of respite concept links to themes of collective hope and shared purpose. However, the theme announces itself explicitly through Elara's dialogue ("we are not alone, that our efforts matter") rather than emerging from dramatized conflict. The final paragraph summarizes the thematic lesson rather than embodying it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent fairy-tale register but lacks distinct perceptual signature. Elara's ghostly perspective doesn't meaningfully alter how events are perceived. The settlers' dialogue is minimal and undifferentiated, missing opportunities for voice distinction or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The prose is clean but suffers from abstraction ("brambled hope was palpable") and repetitive constructions. Several passages tell rather than show ("Their conversations shifting from fear to action"). Information density is low, with multiple sentences restating similar content about cooperation and hope.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The altruistic ghost gardener premise offers mild freshness, but execution relies on familiar collective-action templates. The resolution—community coming together to solve a problem through unity—follows predictable beats without transformation or surprise. The specific world details don't fundamentally alter the generic arc.</comment>
