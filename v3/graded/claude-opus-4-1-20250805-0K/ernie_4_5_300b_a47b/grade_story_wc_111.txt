<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her patient methodology consistent, but the internal conflict lacks embodied contradiction—we see her methods but not her doubts or costs. The interaction with Joren provides external pressure but arrives late; his conversion feels too smooth without genuine resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story establishes its accumulative/textural lens through the marble-polishing ritual and vine-tending, but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost—Joren's adoption of a marble suggests change without showing what he sacrifices or how the maze actually "remembers." The final image of the maze blooming "because of" wounds attempts resonance but doesn't demonstrate the claimed transformation on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The maze setting provides coherent spatial logic and the marbles function as micro-setting that accumulates meaning through specific memories (stubborn root, redirected vine). However, the maze's physical properties and shifting mechanics remain vague; we're told it "shifts daily" but never experience this constraint affecting a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (proving human touch matters) is signaled early but pressure remains static—Elara demonstrates her methods to Joren without escalating cost or narrowing options. The maze's "shifting paths" are mentioned but never create active obstacles; the sensor-blocking demonstration lacks urgency or consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of human resilience versus algorithmic precision emerges through the marble metaphor and Elara's methods, with the cracks-as-victories concept providing texture. However, the resolution slides into explicit thematic statement ("gardens know their gardeners") rather than letting the final image carry meaning; the ending paragraph directly explains the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture—Elara's perceptual signature doesn't differentiate from standard third-person description. Dialogue between Elara and Joren is functional but lacks subtext; their exchange proceeds through direct questions and explanations without indirection or character-specific speech patterns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with some effective images (marbles as "ledger of resilience"), but suffers from repetitive phrasing around key concepts—"gardens know their gardeners" appears verbatim three times. The final two paragraphs contain exposition that restates rather than advances ("it was not the algorithms that defined success").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The premise of quantifiable luck in a shifting maze offers potential but execution relies on familiar mentor-student dynamics without transformation. The marble-polishing ritual as resistance to technology is serviceable but doesn't surprise; Elara's methods (redirecting vines, reading maze rhythms) lack specificity that would make them memorable.</comment>
