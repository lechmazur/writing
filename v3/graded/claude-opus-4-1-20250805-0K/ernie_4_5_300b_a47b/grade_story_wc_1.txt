Looking at this story through an Accumulative/Textural lens, as it builds meaning through frost patterns, glass imagery, and the recurring pause motif rather than strict causal chains.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lirael's transformation from hollow survivor to purpose-finder is earned through concrete discovery, with her glass artist identity constraining how she perceives the frost patterns. The internal conflict between creation and survival manifests in specific choices, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("mark time, to etch her existence into the world's quiet intervals").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Lirael's decision to teach others to "read the frost" and find "scorched testaments," with visible cost in abandoning traditional glasswork. The accumulative structure coheres through frost/fire/glass patterns, though the smuggler backstory feels slightly disconnected from the final revelation about pauses.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The canyon setting actively constrains movement ("forcing her to crawl") and provides the frost patterns that drive discovery. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"walls rising like ancient ribs," frost as "tiny prisms"—with the environment directly enabling the story's central revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes deepen from physical survival to existential purpose, with the frost-reading discovery narrowing Lirael's options toward a specific artistic path. The cost appears in abandoning traditional glasswork for ephemeral teaching, though the smuggler threat never resurfaces to test her new understanding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pause motif—from survival's aftermath to frost patterns to the smuggler's philosophy to Lirael's final understanding. The ending's "hidden maps" reweights all prior searching without stating a moral, achieving resonance through accumulated imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with controlled rhythm ("melting scrap glass into vases that caught the sun in liquid swirls"). The perceptual signature—seeing through an artist's eye—stays distinct, though occasional abstractions ("drifting resonance of the words") slightly dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose achieves strong imagery and varied syntax, but contains scaffold phrases ("She realized," "She sensed") and one template run in the penultimate paragraph ("She would... she'd craft... she'd teach"). Information density is generally high with purposeful rhythm variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The frost-as-map concept offers fresh specificity, transforming both smuggling and glass artistry into ephemeral pattern-reading. The synthesis of survival, art, and transience feels earned, though the smuggler connection could be more tightly integrated.</comment>
