I'll evaluate this story as a demanding editor, applying the rubric strictly.

**Drive Lens:** Causal - the story follows a clear because/therefore chain: Kael's loneliness leads him to search for Veyra, whose clues guide him to Lira, who reveals herself as the artist, completing the connection.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and his "boldly sympathetic" trait manifests in concrete actions. However, the revelation lacks genuine internal conflict - Kael experiences surprise but no meaningful cost or difficult choice at closure. The luminescent ache is named but not fully embodied through contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The causal chain holds and reaches a Decisive Change when Lira reveals herself as Veyra. However, the cost remains abstract - "a thread connecting two hearts" doesn't show what Kael sacrifices or risks. The closure lands but lacks the visible price required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and glass trees create a distinctive setting that shapes action - Kael uses tree sap for his sculptures. The crater's "peculiar light" enables the constellation visibility. Setting constrains choices through the tags' placement "where light bends," though some descriptions trend ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (connection vs. isolation) is clear and escalates through Kael's seven-day search. However, the resolution arrives through Lira's choice to reveal herself rather than through Kael's agency. The "test" concept retroactively reframes the conflict but doesn't create genuine opposition or cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The kinship theme emerges through concrete images - the obsidian arbor, Veyra's murals of joining hands, the final shared thread. The story resists explicit moralizing. However, the thematic resolution feels neat rather than complex, and Lira's explanation ("The tags aren't just art—they're a test") edges toward thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with selective perception fitting a sculptor's attention to light and form. Dialogue between Kael and Lira feels natural with appropriate subtext. Some phrases like "liquid mercury" and "vibrant tapestry" trend toward writerly cliché rather than character-specific observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose flows clearly with varied sentence structure and purposeful imagery. However, several overwrought phrases appear: "where time pooled like liquid mercury," "vibrant tapestry of traders." The metaphor density in the opening paragraph doesn't serve pressure. Some redundancy: "boldly sympathetic, a trait that drew others to him."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The glass tree orchard and crater setting offers a fresh frame for the connection theme. The street artist hunt provides an interesting quest structure. However, the resolution - mysterious artist as helper testing the seeker - follows a familiar pattern without significant transformation or risk.</comment>
