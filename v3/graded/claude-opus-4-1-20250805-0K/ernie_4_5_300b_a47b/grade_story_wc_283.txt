I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and symbolic resonance rather than strict causal chains, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Mara transforms from prophecy-seeker to possibility-spinner.

<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (sorting buttons, turning the hourglass), with her internal state filtering perception effectively. The transformation from seeking prophecy to embracing malleable possibility earns its cost through accumulated detail, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("her mind a library of half-remembered tales").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: Mara shifts from seeking fixed prophecy to understanding futures as "fields to be planted," with the echo's release as visible cost. The accumulative structure coheres through button-sorting as metaphor for unscrambling truth, though the conceptual cost could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber warehouse constrains and enables choices throughout—the dusty labyrinth necessitates methodical searching, the buttons provide the key method, the window offers the release point. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("groaning like ancient bones"), with the setting actively shaping Mara's tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through the jar's increasing resonance and Mara's methodical button-sorting, with the echo's message forcing her stance crystallization. The release of the echo into the world carries clear cost (giving up possession of the relic), though escalation could tighten further in the middle section.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the button-sorting metaphor and the canyon echo's wisdom about past threading into future. The final image of Mara cataloging new buttons while the echo spreads offers a non-literal answer about creation versus discovery, though one passage veers toward explicit statement ("prophecies weren't fixed—they were malleable").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistency with evocative diction ("unearthed silence," "amber light pulsed") that matches the mythic register. Some passages show syntactic monotony with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions, and the perceptual signature could be more distinctive to Mara specifically rather than generically poetic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("wooden beams groaning like ancient bones") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract patches. Several sentences could be compressed for momentum, and some figurative language feels decorative rather than essential ("her thoughts sharpened like flint").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The hourglass turner role and button-cataloging method offer fresh angles on prophecy-manipulation. The synthesis of archaeological discovery with temporal philosophy creates moderate originality, though some elements feel familiar (mysterious jar with ancient wisdom, warehouse of forgotten relics).</comment>
