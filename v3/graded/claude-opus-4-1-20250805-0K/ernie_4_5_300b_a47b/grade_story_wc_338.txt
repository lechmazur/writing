I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through layered imagery and pattern accumulation toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elias's understanding of the chapel transforms from barrier to bridge.

<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's methodical curiosity drives concrete micro-choices throughout—comparing film frames, aligning the sextant, pressing his ear to stone. His internal contradiction between scholarly distance and ancestral pull creates genuine tension, and the final realization that "silence is language" earns its cost through prior investigation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias discovers the chapel is a "bridge" not a barrier, reweighting all prior investigation through the lens of "listening past noise." The cost—entering unknown darkness, risking the ancestral mystery—is felt through embodied details like "chest tightened" and "breath visible." Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The henge's stones with shifting carvings constrain Elias's approach, requiring specific tools (sextant, holy water) and methods. The fresco vault's "rain-scoured" saints mirror the final intact ones, creating environmental resonance. The central crack that "bleeds light" becomes the literal threshold he must cross.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates through textural deepening: the 1923 footage dissolves to static, modern footage reveals widened cracks, carvings shift inward "as if guarding a secret." The escalation from archival research to physical descent into darkness carries clear cost, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily once he applies holy water.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of "reopening silence" as discovering language in the unsaid emerges organically through concrete details—the "whispered liturgy" without vowels, the henge vibrating at unhearable frequencies. The final insight that silence requires "empathy in the unsaid" reweights all prior scholarly distance into necessary listening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature through Elias's map-framer lens: "borders where others saw blankness," perceiving the tear as "threshold" not divide. Some register elevation in peak moments ("methodology curious," "resonant reconfiguration") slightly strains the established voice, though the overall texture remains distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, but several instances of elevated diction clash with immediacy: "methodology curious" appears twice, "resonant reconfiguration" feels academic. Template structures emerge in the tool-packing sequence ("a brass sextant, a vial of holy water...") and some paraphrase loops around the silence-as-language concept dilute momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of archaeological mystery with "silence as language" offers a fresh angle on the ancient-site trope. The specific detail of comparing footage across a century to track carved symbols' migration, and the "whispered liturgy without vowels" concept, creates originality through particular execution rather than surface novelty.</comment>
