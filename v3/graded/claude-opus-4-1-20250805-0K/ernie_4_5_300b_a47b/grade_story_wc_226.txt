<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's defiant artistry and belief in refracting truth drives clear, escalating choices from painting "Forgive" to disrupting the ritual. His internal consistency holds through pressure, though the epiphany about forgiveness as courage feels slightly unearned. The final transformation from heretic to "artist who'd finally learned how to see" lands with modest cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through escalating imagery (bone towers glowing with colors) to a Resonant Reconfiguration where light literally refracts truth. The closure lands with visible cost—Kael knows he'll be called a heretic tomorrow. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words, and the ritual deadline creates genuine pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The canyon of bone towers and pale spire creates atmospheric pressure that shapes Kael's choices—he must climb towers, work in shadows, use the canyon's echoes. Sensory detail (damp stone and iron smell, twisted echoes) filters through his artist's perception. The spire's transformation from forbidden object to prism of light directly enables closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from artistic defiance to disrupting a binding ritual with community-wide consequences. The confrontation with the elder provides one meaningful tightening, though her curiosity shift feels abrupt. Cost is visible—tomorrow's heresy charge—but the immediate consequence of mass enlightenment lacks darker complexity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The refraction metaphor elegantly unifies theme and action, with Kael literally making the spire scatter light/truth. "Rituals are just poems we've forgotten how to rewrite" resonates without preaching. The forgiveness theme could probe deeper into what specific grudges festered, but the kaleidoscope-truth concept lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains poetic consistency with controlled rhythm ("towers of bone rose like crooked teeth"). Kael's dialogue carries subtext and advances his goals. Some register elevation in narration ("monolithic lies," "kaleidoscope") slightly exceeds his artist-rebel lexicon without clear pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose flows with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("bruised sky," "canyon's throat"). Information density is generally strong. Minor template cadence in the resolution sequence ("The elders screamed... but the villagers... stood rapt") and some filter constructions ("he realized," "he believed") dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept of truth-as-kaleidoscope and forgiveness-as-weapon offers fresh angles on familiar rebellion narratives. Kael's impromptu poetry sessions as resistance method feels specific. The bone towers and pale spire create memorable world-building, though the resolution's unanimous enlightenment feels safely optimistic.</comment>
