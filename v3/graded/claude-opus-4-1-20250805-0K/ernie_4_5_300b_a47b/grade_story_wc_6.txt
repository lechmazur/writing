<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's internal struggle between inherited guilt and redemptive purpose drives authentic choices, particularly in her interaction with Mara about letting go. The "arsonist's daughter" identity creates genuine tension that resolves through embodied action rather than epiphany. Minor deduction for some emotional labeling ("guilt," "restlessness") rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant closure through the "scars can sing" motif paying off in action and final reflection. The bird-healing sequence meaningfully transforms Lira's relationship to damage and growth, with visible cost in releasing what we help. Slight dock for the final paragraph's mild abstraction diluting the otherwise strong image-based closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and volcanic sand constrain and enable choices—the kelp becomes splint material, the black sand embodies fertility-from-ash. Setting details filter through Lira's firefighter awareness and her preoccupation with transformation. The environment actively participates in the resolution rather than merely framing it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The central stake—proving transformation is possible—escalates through the bird-healing challenge and Mara's fear of loss. Cost becomes visible when Lira must confront her father's legacy directly ("But I'm not him") and when Mara releases the bird. The pressure coheres but could tighten further; the family's arrival feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The scars-as-song metaphor emerges organically through concrete actions—the coin's jingle calming the bird, the healed wing's flight, the grain of sand as "unyielding spark." Theme develops through embodied moments rather than statement. Final image of the vanishing sand grain resonates without explaining, though the last paragraph edges toward mild abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close-third POV with firefighter-specific perception ("gracefully alert," tactical assessment of the wing break). Dialogue carries subtext effectively, especially Mara's "What if she forgets me?" Voice modulates appropriately under emotional pressure, though some passages lean slightly writerly ("a slow, gray parade").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is solid—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot simultaneously. Some metaphorical density in places ("shimmered like a broken mirror," "jingled like a warning") and occasional abstraction ("something loosen in her chest") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The firefighter-daughter-of-arsonist premise offers genuine tension, and linking physical healing to emotional scarring shows thoughtful synthesis. The bird-as-proxy-for-self works without feeling forced. Doesn't quite reach exceptional originality but avoids cliché through specific detail and earned emotional complexity.</comment>
