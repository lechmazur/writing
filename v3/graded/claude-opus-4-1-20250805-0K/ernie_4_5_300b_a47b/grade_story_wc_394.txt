I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through pattern accumulation (kaleidoscope images, algorithm translation) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Lira's yearning algorithm transforms into actual motion/sound.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's obsessive motivation drives clear choices throughout, from studying the arrow tip's gaps to mounting the glider for the final attempt. Her contradictory impulses ("steadily curious" yet restless) manifest in scene through concrete actions. The final choice to hurl the arrow tip into the bell is earned through prior pattern-work, though some interiority edges toward explanatory ("The algorithm, she'd theorized, wasn't in the metal but in the *gaps*").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly: the bell that "no one hears yet" transforms from metaphor to actual vibration that "rippled through the acid sea." The accumulative structure coheres as kaleidoscope patterns translate into glider adjustments, building to the final hum. Cost is felt through the dangerous dive and the irreversible hurling of the treasured arrow tip. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~60 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The acid sea and sulfurous winds constrain Lira's movements and create urgency ("acid mist seeped through cracks... She'd have to work faster"). The workshop's gears provide both metronome and obstacle. The kaleidoscope becomes active setting when "strapped to her thigh, projected images onto the mist," directly enabling the final navigation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from intellectual puzzle to physical risk as Lira launches into "sulfurous wind" with "gears screaming." The kaleidoscope visions narrow options progressively (crashed glider → embedded arrow → necessary collision). The final dive with the arrow tip as "conductor's baton" shows clear agency driving toward irreversible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the central metaphor of translating yearning into motion without explicit statement. The "gaps between desire and action" philosophy gains resonance when actualized in the final flight. Old Thrum's "seen, not solved" wisdom pays off concretely. The ending hum that rewrites the world avoids tidy resolution while delivering thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent inventive diction ("gears with feet," "unspool the future") and rhythm that accelerates during action. POV control holds steady with selective perception fitting Lira's obsessive focus. Dialogue serves character efficiently. Minor strain appears in explanatory passages ("She'd spent years studying the tip's grooves") that momentarily flatten immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose density is high with most sentences advancing multiple purposes. Strong verbs and specific nouns dominate ("spirals that defied logic," "sulfurous winds"). Some scaffold appears in the algorithm theorizing section with near-duplicate concepts. The final sequence achieves excellent propulsion, though middle sections occasionally loop conceptually ("transliterate" appears 5 times with similar function).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The yearning algorithm concept freshly synthesizes desire and mechanical motion in unexpected ways. The acid sea workshop setting avoids generic steampunk through specific details. The transformation of abstract algorithm into physical bell-ringing through kaleidoscope translation feels both surprising and inevitable. Risk-taking in the conceptual fusion heightens rather than obscures.</comment>
