<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is grounded in specific history (emancipation, decades of archival work) with clear emotional stakes tied to being "unwanted." His progression from cataloging to active investigation shows agency, though internal contradiction could be more embodied in scene rather than told ("tactfully hopeful"). The final choice to create a new folder represents meaningful action with implicit cost (acknowledging unknowability).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through layered discoveries (button, dust patterns, date inscription). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias creates the new folder, accepting partial knowledge as sufficient—a stance shift with conceptual cost. However, the middle lacks a decisive tightening moment where accumulated details force a choice, weakening escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The file room setting constrains action effectively through specific details (dust patterns, shelf arrangements) that become investigative tools. Sensory work is selective and purposeful ("mildew and forgotten years," "creak of old wood"). The micro-setting of dust accumulation functions as active environment, though some descriptions lean generic ("labyrinth of half-truths").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding meaning in forgotten histories) is signaled early but pressure remains static—Elias moves through discoveries without meaningful resistance or cost. The button's discovery and date revelation deepen knowledge but don't force trade-offs. Agency exists in the final decision to document, but escalation under the Accumulative lens needed sharper density increase or pattern break.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery process—the button as metonym for erased histories. The ending offers resonant answer without moralizing: incomplete stories still deserve witness. However, some passages veer toward abstract philosophizing ("magnify the small kindnesses hidden in the gaps") rather than staying grounded in particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable with consistent focalization through Elias. Voice shows distinct texture in archival language ("cataloging the lives of children who'd slipped through society's cracks"). However, register occasionally drifts into academic abstraction inconsistent with character's embodied perspective, particularly in reflective passages about "language of neglect."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from paraphrase loops (multiple restatements about forgotten children) and abstract scaffolding. Template cadence appears in "He imagined... He imagined... And then he imagined" sequence. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("silent tombs," "labyrinth of half-truths") without pattern-teaching dilutes momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The concept of archival detective work through dust patterns offers fresh angle on historical recovery narrative. Specific synthesis of Civil War button with foster care records creates non-obvious connection. However, execution relies on some familiar tropes (mysterious object reveals hidden history) without sufficient transformation through lived detail.</comment>
