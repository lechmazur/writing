<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lirael's reckless idealism drives meaningful choices with embodied cost—her palm on the skeleton's ribcage, stitching bones with "whispers of regret turned into resolve." The transformation from certainty to "fiercely gentle" wisdom feels earned through concrete action, though some interiority edges toward diagnostic ("always charging forward without looking back").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through ritual progression: entering orchard → bartering the Fool card → stitching the skeleton → eating fruit → emerging transformed. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("holes in her soul, once gaping wounds, now shimmered with newfound resilience"), though the keeper's explanatory dialogue slightly dilutes the earned quality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard constrains choices effectively—roots that "snaked through bones," bioluminescent fungi casting "dusky resolve," the single tree cradling a skeleton. Setting actively shapes the ritual's mechanics and charges the final emergence into sunset, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("torches flickered like souls trapped between worlds").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through ritual accumulation: initial bargain → touching skeleton → stitching bones → eating fruit, each deepening commitment with tangible cost. The "fiercely gentle blade to cut through illusion" and vision of "every mistake and triumph woven into a single, flawed whole" demonstrate meaningful pressure, though agency feels slightly guided by the keeper.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of recklessness into "fiercely gentle force, capable of both destruction and creation." The burned Fool card's journey from failure-marker to ash-offering resonates without moralizing, and the boy's drowning recontextualizes from failure to lesson through earned vision.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled rhythm ("Her bones nourish the soil"), though occasional register drift appears ("residual energy," "diagnostic pose"). Dialogue carries appropriate mystical weight but sometimes explains rather than dramatizes ("Your past is ash, but from ash, new growth rises").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("needle carved from a single bone," "thread spun from spider silk and moonlight") but suffers from abstract summaries ("trail of broken lives," "flawed whole") and some template phrasing. The keeper's dialogue occasionally scaffolds meaning that the scene should dramatize.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bartering-souls-in-an-orchard premise transforms familiar quest structure through specific ritual mechanics—stitching bones with moonlight thread, eating heart-fruit for vision. The "fiercely gentle" paradox and skeleton-as-cautionary-teacher avoid predictable redemption arcs, though some metaphysical elements feel familiar.</comment>
