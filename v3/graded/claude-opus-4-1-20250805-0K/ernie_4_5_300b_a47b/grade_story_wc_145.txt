I'll evaluate this story under the **Accumulative/Textural lens**, as it builds through pattern, image recurrence, and density shifts toward a conceptual repricing where Clara reconceptualizes maps and rivers as living systems.

<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara's motivation to find where rivers begin—their "reasons"—drives concrete choices from testing salinity to chipping at glowing ice. Her dry wit ("Only if the rivers stop flowing") and subtle confidence manifest in specific actions. The transformation from believing "maps are promises" to "maps are lies" shows earned change through embodied discovery, though some interiority edges toward abstraction ("knowing" as a concept).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story achieves Conceptual Repricing: rivers reconceived as light-born from tectonic convergence rather than water sources, with Clara's worldview fundamentally altered ("Maps are lies. They erase the truth"). The accumulative lens holds through condensation patterns, the falcon's returns, and layered river imagery. Cost appears in Clara being "half-buried in snow" and her raw voice, though the final third rushes through years without deepening the immediate price of her discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen landscape constrains every choice—from waiting at the frosted window to following the falcon's shadow across the glacial plateau. Condensation patterns recur as both window frost and tent fractals, creating environmental mirroring. The glowing ice discovery emerges from specific geological detail (pitted ice "as if something had clawed its way out"), and the setting's hostility ("You'll freeze your brain out here") pressures the journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on Clara's quest to understand river origins, with escalation from receiving the singed map to discovering rivers begin in light/pressure rather than water. The glacial trek and midnight ice-chipping show agency under pressure. However, the discovery itself feels somewhat convenient—the glowing veins appear exactly when needed, and the resolution jumps to "years later" without exploring immediate consequences of this world-changing discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of hidden truths beneath mapped surfaces emerges through concrete discovery—literal light beneath ice revealing rivers' true origins. "Maps are lies. They erase the truth" resonates as earned wisdom from Clara's physical journey. The phrasebook's evolution from "urgent travel" to "To speak the language of convergence, listen" adds thematic texture, and the final image of Clara drawing on blank pages while "rivers flowed on, their secrets safe" achieves resonance without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clara's voice maintains dry wit ("The falcon's never late. It's the world that's out of sync") and professional precision (testing salinity, noting tectonic plates). Jorn's mechanic's rasp ("You'll die out there") contrasts effectively. Some passages drift toward elevated register during discovery ("rivers' source wasn't water. It was *light*") that slightly exceeds Clara's established lexicon, and the final paragraph's "quiet between heartbeats" feels more authorial than character-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong moments like "Clara didn't turn" and "his version of solidarity" show efficient characterization. However, several abstractions weaken line-level craft: "knowing" as undefined concept, "collision of forces," and the vague "Years later" transition that compresses without detail. The phrase "somewhere, a falcon laughed" anthropomorphizes oddly. Information density varies—the discovery scene builds well, but the epilogue-style ending summarizes rather than dramatizes Clara's transformed practice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of rivers originating from tectonic light rather than water offers genuine freshness, as does the polyglot's phrasebook revealing hidden wisdom about convergence. Clara's transformation from mapping surfaces to understanding deeper truths avoids simple revelation. However, the "mysterious map leading to mystical discovery" frame follows familiar patterns, and the rushed years-later ending chooses safe summary over dramatized consequence.</comment>
