<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his guilt over the compromised eulogy, driving his pursuit of ethical storytelling through subversive means. His internal conflict between artistic integrity and past compromises manifests concretely through the puppet show's execution. The transformation from complicit calligrapher to truth-seeking performer is earned, though some interiority relies on abstract declarations ("Stories are thieves") rather than fully embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias's puppet show serving as both literal performance and metaphorical exploration of truth-telling, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where he finds his method through "half-lit epiphanies." The closure lands with conceptual cost—accepting that "half-truths are the only kind worth telling"—though the cost could be more viscerally felt. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established within the first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The radar dome functions as more than setting—its "skeletal ribs" and residual signals create an atmosphere of abandoned communication that mirrors Elias's search for authentic storytelling. The dome's isolation and post-argument tension constrain and enable his experimental performance. The campfire story stick's runes project holograms onto curved walls, making the physical space integral to the puppet show's execution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding ethical storytelling after compromising truth for elegance—is signaled early and tested through the puppet show performance. The drifter's challenge ("Sounds like you're just making excuses for half-truths") forces Elias to crystallize his stance, though this confrontation could carry more immediate cost. The resolution through accepting paradox ("Half-truths are the only kind worth telling") represents a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the puppet show's content—king and pauper swapping roles—and Mara's campfire metaphor that stories "keep the dark at bay, but they also cast shadows." The final realization that ethical stories are "campfires, flickering in the dark" resonates without moralizing. The exploration of truth versus elegance, power versus perception, develops through concrete dramatic action rather than abstract philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Voice maintains an elevated literary register appropriate to an urbane calligrapher ("meteor hush," "serifed verses smooth as lies") with consistent POV control. Dialogue differentiates characters effectively—the drifter's skepticism, Mara's thoughtful engagement, Elias's measured responses. Some interiority tends toward the declarative ("Stories are thieves") rather than perceptual specificity, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages ("The decommissioned radar dome loomed like a rusted crown"). Information density is generally high, though some passages contain mild redundancy (the puppet show description could be tighter). No significant loops or scaffolding detected, but occasional abstract declarations ("ethical storytelling isn't about hiding the dark") reduce immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept of ethical storytelling through "subversive puppet shows" offers a fresh angle on the artist's moral responsibility. The specific synthesis of calligrapher-turned-puppeteer exploring truth through shadow-play feels organic rather than assembled. While the premise engages meaningfully with its themes, the resolution into accepting "half-truths" represents a somewhat safe middle position rather than a bold stance.</comment>
