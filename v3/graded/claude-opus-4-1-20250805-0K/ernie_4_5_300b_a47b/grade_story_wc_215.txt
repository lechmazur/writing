<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve unspoken words drives meaningful action, culminating in his choice to break decades of silence. The internal contradiction between preserving silence and the need to speak creates authentic tension. Deduction for the somewhat abstract epiphany about the "tangled covenant" which edges toward diagnostic understanding rather than embodied realization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (ghosts, glass visions, shattered release) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where speaking releases both ghosts and burden. Cost is visible in the decades of silence broken and the physical shattering of the artifact. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical revelation sequence that could be more causally grounded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The wasteland and abandoned oasis effectively constrain Elias's world, with the stained glass box functioning as micro-setting that drives choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("brittle yellow" honeycombs, "hot breeze"). Doesn't quite reach higher bands as the environment could more actively pressure the final speaking choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through accumulating pressure: ghosts becoming visible, then solid, then the box glowing and revealing visions. The dominant stake (releasing unspoken words) tightens when Elias must choose between preserving silence and speaking. Cost is legible in the decades of solitude broken, though the resolution feels slightly predetermined.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the weight of unspoken words and the covenant between living and dead. The final shattering of glass into stars offers resonant closure without stating a moral. Strong integration of silence/speech paradox throughout, with the ghost presence adding layers to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate psychic distance. Voice modulates effectively during the vision sequence and speaking moment. Some register elevation in phrases like "tangled covenant" and "tranquilly perceptive" that don't fully match Elias's decades of isolation, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("tangled covenant between the land and its forgotten keepers"), some filter-verb clustering ("he saw," "he felt," "he understood"), and occasional overwriting in the metaphysical descriptions that slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of ghosts making unspoken words visible offers a fresh angle on grief and communication. The synthesis of beekeeping imagery with spiritual resolution shows originality. However, the resolution mechanism (speaking to release ghosts) follows familiar patterns without sufficient transformation to elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>
