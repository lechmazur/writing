<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent. However, Elara's interiority lacks contradiction; she reads as a highly competent practitioner of her art, but the personal struggle or flaw that would give her more depth is absent. Her defining trait is her carefulness, which is demonstrated, but she never seems tempted by haste or doubt, making her feel more like a vessel for the story's concept than a complex individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The structure is flawless for this length, operating as a single, well-paced scene with a strong Accumulative/Textural drive. The Conceptual Repricing at the end—redefining "purity" from an artifact to an emotional truth—is powerful and lands with on-page evidence (the reformed snowflake). The only minor weakness is that the final causal leap from the specific cameos to the grand conclusion about "suppressed affections" feels slightly asserted rather than fully shown, a tell that slightly softens an otherwise excellent closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is the story's triumph, functioning not as a backdrop but as the central mechanism of the plot. The "windows of connection" chiseled into the ice are an unforgettable and integral concept. Atmosphere is dense and purposeful, with details like "borrowed starlight" and "veins of blue ice" directly participating in the climax and charging the final, transformative image of the warming shrine. This is exemplary integration of setting and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—salvaging purity—is established early and reweighted beautifully at the conclusion. The narrative deepens effectively by focusing on specific cameos, particularly the midshipman, which acts as the key piece of evidence that shifts Elara's understanding. The cost of the "fatal isolations" is made legible, and the resolution is driven entirely by Elara's agency, making the final release feel earned and impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A resonant theme about the nature of humanity and connection emerges organically from the story's particulars. The melted snow globe and the reformed snowflake serve as a perfect thematic container for the idea of reclaiming something pure from tragedy. The score is held back by the one moment of overt thematic statement: "...the expedition's downfall stemmed from suppressed affections..." which explains the theme to the reader directly, rather than trusting the powerful imagery to convey it alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The point of view is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a lyrical, melancholic voice that perfectly suits the material. Elara's perceptual signature is distinct, focused on ethereal and spectral details. The voice, while beautiful, is perhaps too uniform; its rhythm and elevated register remain constant even as the climax approaches, missing an opportunity to modulate with the rising emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious and often stunning, with memorable phrases like "slushy memories of a world unthawed." However, it frequently tips into overwriting, with a high density of similes and metaphors that can feel decorative and slow the momentum. A more disciplined hand would have allowed the strongest images to stand out by trimming the surrounding figurative language, creating a cleaner and more propulsive read.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable ingenuity by blending the historical mystery of the Franklin expedition with a wholly original paranormal framework. The core concept of analyzing ghost "cameos" in the dreams of strangers is fresh and compelling. This synthesis transforms a familiar tragedy into a unique and poignant exploration of human connection, avoiding genre clichés and delivering a memorable, specific vision.</comment>
