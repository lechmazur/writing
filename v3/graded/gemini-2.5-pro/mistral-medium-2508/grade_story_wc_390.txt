<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is exceptional. The engineer's motivation is rooted in a unique professional competence—understanding the marina's "language"—and a clear moral calculus. The internal conflict is concisely captured ("Logic demanded she run. Emotion demanded she stay") and resolved through a choice that has a clear, embodied cost, earning the final transformation into "something less human, more ethereal." Her competence and sacrifice feel specific and inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. Orientation is immediate, and pressure builds through sensory details—the groaning ice, the subsonic hum—that cohere into a single, urgent threat. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration; the act of turning the key provides a Decisive Change, but the true resolution is the Conceptual Repricing of her existence and the lighthouse's function, with the cost of her humanity paid on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's triumph. The "drift-ice marina" is not a backdrop but a core narrative engine, acting as a "natural dampener," a ticking clock (the thinning ice), and a resonant participant in the climax ("The ice beneath her feet *sang back*"). This integration of environment and plot is seamless and powerful, constraining every choice and charging the final image with immense resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes are established with chilling efficiency: the artifact isn't a relic, it's a bomb. The escalation is perfectly suited to the accumulative lens, driven by the decaying environment (thinning ice, turning tide) rather than plot twists. The protagonist's agency is absolute at the climax, and the cost of her choice—the unraveling of her flesh—is unmistakable and directly proportional to the world-scale stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Thematic handling is sophisticated. The story introduces the concept of "sonic absolution" and masterfully redefines it from a spiritual erasure of sin to a physical act of matching frequencies. The final image of the lighthouse beam as a "hymn" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, beautifully captured in the line "forgiven by physics." It achieves profound depth without a single line of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, creating a distinct perceptual signature focused on sound and vibration. POV is tightly controlled, and psychic distance is masterfully handled, drawing close for the physical sensations of the climax. The prose itself has a rhythmic, humming quality that mirrors the story's content, achieving a rare harmony between style and subject.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is dense, evocative, and highly polished, with very few wasted words. Figurative language is consistently strong and purposeful ("cracks spreading like veins," "sunset bled gold"). While verging on ornate, the richness serves the story's elevated, mythic tone and never obscures the action, especially during the high-pressure climax where the sentences maintain clarity and propulsion. No significant prose artifacts are present.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable originality by synthesizing disparate elements—acoustics, theology, cryo-mechanics, cosmic horror—into a coherent and resonant whole. It transforms the "lone guardian" trope by making the conflict one of physics and resonance rather than brute force. The conceptual twist on "absolution" is an ingenious core that feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable.</comment>
