<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lena's characterization is exceptional, driven by an internal conflict that is shown, not just summarized. Her motivation to find truth in wreckage is established early and tested in the scene, first with the widow and then with her own past. The final interaction with her mother's memory—"I did. I just kept the parts worth saving"—is a perfect micro-choice that solidifies her philosophy as an act of earned stasis rather than simple endurance, meeting the 9+ test with clear, felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and evocative, and the narrative builds emotional and atmospheric pressure toward a powerful closure. The ending delivers a dual Resonant Reconfiguration: the widow's grief is re-centered on the living with on-page proof ("a small, waving hand"), and Lena's purpose is reaffirmed. The cost for both characters is legible and poignant, making for a structurally perfect piece at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully integrated, functioning as both atmosphere and an active participant in the story. The glacier shrine is not merely a backdrop; its properties—the ice groaning like a ship, the blue veins of time—directly reflect the themes of buried memory and immense, slow-moving grief. Crucially, the melted snow globe acts as a micro-setting that constrains the central action and delivers the final, charging image, easily satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The conflict is intimate and powerful, with a single, dominant stake that is expertly deepened. The central turn—revealing the child instead of the fisherman—is not a simple reversal but a profound shift in the nature of the widow's grief, executed by Lena's deliberate agency. This deepening forces a trade-off, where the widow must relinquish the ghost she sought to embrace the love he left behind, showing a clear and emotionally resonant cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of salvaging meaning from wreckage emerges organically from character and action, avoiding sentimentality. The story's final images—the waving hand in the globe, Lena lighting another candle—provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to live with loss. The final lines ("The cracks were how the light got in") border on explicit moralizing but are earned as the crystallization of Lena's personal philosophy, grounding the theme in her specific, hard-won perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with impeccable control, establishing a distinct and memorable narrative voice from the first sentence. Lena’s perceptual signature—seeing the dead as seeping "like the color of old silver"—is consistent and colors the entire story with a lyrical, melancholic authority. The prose rhythm modulates perfectly with the emotional intensity of the scene, demonstrating a high level of craft and confidence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose is luminous, dense with imagery that is both beautiful and purposeful, consistently advancing character and theme. Sentence structure is varied and rhythmic, creating a propulsive yet contemplative pace. There are no wasted words or scaffold phrases. While the density of figurative language is high, it rarely feels overwrought, instead serving to build the story’s unique, ice-bound reality with precision and grace.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable originality by taking the familiar "ghost whisperer" trope and transforming it into something specific, intimate, and emotionally complex. The central conceit of interpreting the *wrong ghost* is an ingenious turn that elevates the narrative beyond a simple haunting. The synthesis of a unique setting (glacier shrine), a specific magical system (reading emotional residue), and a profound thematic core feels both fresh and inevitable.</comment>
