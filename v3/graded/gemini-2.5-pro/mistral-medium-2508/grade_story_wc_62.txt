<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The carver’s motivation is palpable and his internal conflict is beautifully externalized through his craft. The final choice to carve the "hollows" is a powerful, earned shift. The only minor weakness is the slight over-articulation in the final poem he adds, which summarizes his new mission statement a bit too tidily for a character who has just had a breakthrough.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural structure is executed flawlessly across two shards (greenhouse, dinner). The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, where the carver's understanding of grief and his craft is irrevocably altered. The cost—letting go of a static, 15-year-old wound for a dynamic, shared presence—is deeply felt and masterfully dramatized in the final scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in pathetic fallacy and atmosphere. The ancient greenhouse at dusk is not merely a backdrop but a liminal space that enables the supernatural encounter. The way the butterflies transform the space into a "lantern" directly constrains the emotional climax and charges the final image, making the setting an indispensable agent in the story's resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story's central stake—*Could grief be carved?*—is established immediately and deepens with immense pressure. The escalation is internal and textural, culminating in the cracked stone, which forces a confrontation with his static grief. The final choice to embrace the "hollows" is a powerful resolution with a clear, felt cost: the abandonment of a familiar pain for a new, uncertain form of connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of grief as a living presence is developed with superb subtlety through recurring motifs (butterflies, hollows, ribbon). The final image of passing the butterfly powerfully answers the story's central question without moralizing. A slight deduction is for the line, "the shape of collective grief didn’t feel like a wound, but a door," which momentarily slips into thematic summary rather than letting the image do the work alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical, consistent, and possesses a distinct perceptual signature tied to the carver's craft and sorrow. The prose rhythm modulates perfectly with the story's emotional pressure, from the paused chisel to the thundering confirmation. The handling of the spectral dialogue feels seamless and psychologically true, integrated perfectly into the singular POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and imagistically rich, with high information density in most lines. However, a few key moments lean towards being slightly overwritten, where the figurative language becomes so dense it borders on abstraction. For instance, "the echo of a hundred voices reciting poems at a table long abandoned" is a beautiful but somewhat maximalist image that risks pulling away from the character's immediate sensory experience.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of spectral mentorship, the craft of stone carving, and the butterfly migration as metaphors for grief is exceptionally fresh and poignant. The story transforms the familiar trope of a grieving protagonist into something singular and memorable. The concept of carving absence itself is a brilliantly original turn that feels entirely earned by the story's internal logic.</comment>
