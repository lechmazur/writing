<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Qishti's characterization is exceptional, driven by a compelling internal contradiction between his empirical discipline and the dawning mystery. His frugal habits directly motivate the inciting incident, and his scholarly nature drives the plot. The final change is earned and precisely calibrated, articulated in the shift from kneeling "in worship" to kneeling "in recognition"—a perfect synthesis of his old and new self.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story follows a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) lens, building pressure through discovery to a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The closure, where Qishti's scientific worldview is irrevocably expanded, lands on the page with a clear conceptual cost. Causality is seamless from the discovery of the tile to its final placement, making the structure feel both logical and revelatory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully rendered and integral to the plot. The "between regimes" state of the palace provides the opportunity, while specific details like the "cracked mosaic floors" and the "chiseled away sigil" constrain his actions and deepen the atmosphere of forgotten secrets. The final sanctum, with its living schematics, is a potent image that directly charges the climax and thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding a celestial mystery—is signaled immediately and deepens into a profound existential question. The pressure escalates perfectly from intellectual curiosity to a physical and spiritual test at the passage's threshold. The final choice to place the tile on the altar pays a visible conceptual price: the loss of his old, detached view of the universe, which is made legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of empirical knowledge versus immeasurable devotion is explored with subtlety and power, culminating in a resonant final image of the stars as an "intimate" conversation. The insight feels earned through Qishti's struggle. The score is slightly capped by the line "finally understood: some devotions are too vast for numbers," a moment of direct thematic statement that slightly undermines the otherwise perfect subtext of the final beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is flawlessly maintained, with a consistent, lyrical, and scholarly voice that perfectly suits the protagonist. The prose itself becomes a reflection of Qishti's mind: measured, precise, but capable of profound wonder. The narrative stance and psychic distance are controlled with a confidence that makes the character's internal journey feel immediate and authentic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with vivid, original figurative language ("split like a fruit revealing its seed"). Sentence structure varies to control rhythm, slowing for contemplation and quickening with discovery. There are no wasted words or scaffolding. The piece demonstrates a high level of line-level craft, creating a sense of ancient weight and quiet awe.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>While the "secret passage" is a familiar trope, the story transforms it by making the reward a paradigm shift rather than material treasure. The synthesis of ancient Mesopotamian aesthetics with cosmology and the theme of scientific versus spiritual knowing feels fresh and insightful. The story’s power comes from its specific, emotionally authentic execution of this concept, creating a memorable and original vision.</comment>
