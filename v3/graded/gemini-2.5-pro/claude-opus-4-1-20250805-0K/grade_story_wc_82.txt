<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mei's motivation is powerfully established and her "crafty nature" provides a credible throughline for her actions. The character arc is earned and internally consistent. However, a slight tendency toward summarizing her emotional shifts, such as "Mei understood then," keeps it from perfect embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The progression builds emotional and thematic density toward a strong Conceptual Repricing at the end, where grief is re-evaluated as a source of light for others. The final image provides resonant closure with a clear, felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is deeply imaginative, specific, and essential to the plot. The "tea garden suspended between heaven and earth" creates a perfect atmosphere for the story's themes. The glass basilica functions as a key recurring object, initially a source of painful memory and finally the vessel for transformed grief, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The internal stake—Mei’s struggle with grief—is clear and compelling. The conflict deepens effectively when she discovers "possibility" in a gem, which shifts her goal from preservation to creation. This turn is driven by her agency and leads to a resolution with a legible cost: acceptance of loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of transforming grief is developed through a powerful and sustained central metaphor. However, the final paragraph lapses into overt thematic summary ("only transform it into something that helps the living..."), a "Thematic Echo" that slightly undermines the otherwise masterful use of subtext and imagery. Master Shen's dialogue also leans toward direct thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The POV is impeccably controlled, and the lyrical, melancholic voice is sustained effectively throughout, creating a distinct narrative texture. The prose beautifully reflects Mei's internal state. Master Shen’s dialogue feels slightly stilted, serving more as a thematic signpost than natural speech, a minor friction point.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong, resonant imagery. The piece is slightly weakened by a few runs of template cadence, particularly the list-like sentences in the middle ("She captured... She preserved..."). This repetitive structure momentarily flattens the otherwise dynamic rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core concept of recording memories in "dream-gems" as a form of grief therapy is highly original and thoughtfully executed. The synthesis of lantern-making, gem polishing, and the fantastical setting creates a unique and memorable world that feels both fresh and emotionally true.</comment>
