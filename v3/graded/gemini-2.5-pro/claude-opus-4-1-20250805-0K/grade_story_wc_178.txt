<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, framing her frugality not as poverty but as the purchase price for her goal. This single-mindedness provides a powerful engine for the short narrative. While her interiority is sparse, her dedication is convincingly portrayed through her actions, culminating in a final choice that feels earned by her established character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building pressure through layered discoveries rather than causal turns. Orientation is immediate and effective. The closure—a Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing where the covenant is sealed—lands with a clearly articulated cost (a lifetime of devotion), making the final moment both successful and poignant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is the story's greatest strength; the palace is not a backdrop but the central mechanism of the plot—the puzzle, the message, and the communication device. Details like "starlight filtered through calculated gaps" and "phosphorescent minerals" are both atmospheric and functional. The setting directly constrains and enables the protagonist's actions, charging the final image with immense power.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story builds a powerful intellectual and procedural conflict, with stakes that escalate from personal discovery to species-level contact. The pressure deepens with each layer of the puzzle she solves, from the warming tile to the resonant walls. The final choice to complete the covenant is a direct result of this escalation, and the cost—her entire life's focus—is made explicit and validated in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of "encrypted devotion"—the idea that sustained, rational focus is a form of communication—is profound and well-integrated. However, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary, explicitly stating the story's point ("proof that devotion, empirically measured... could bridge the infinite"). This direct moralizing slightly undermines the power of the final image, constituting a thematic echo that prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and appropriately elevated for the story's mythic, intellectual tone. The third-person limited POV remains tightly focused on Mara, effectively filtering all sensory details and revelations through her perspective. The prose maintains a distinct and controlled rhythm that supports the story's atmosphere of ancient mystery meeting scientific rigor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with strong, evocative imagery. There is a slight tendency toward summary and scaffolding in key moments, such as "The covenant required sacrifice—not blood but dedication...". This momentarily shifts from showing to telling, creating a minor drag on the otherwise excellent momentum leading into the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a high degree of originality by synthesizing familiar science fiction tropes (ancient aliens, first contact) with unique, specific concepts like Babylonian astronomy, magic squares, and time as an encryption method. The core idea that devotion itself is the measurable, transmittable signal is a fresh and intellectually engaging premise that is executed with conceptual integrity.</comment>
