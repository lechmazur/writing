<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is superb, with a specific and compelling interiority rooted in the proprioceptive enhancements. The internal conflict between practiced terror and calculated analysis is embodied effectively, not just summarized. The final choice is earned, and the closing line—"feeling the exact pull of seventeen facial muscles"—is a perfect, character-particular payoff showing her transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through sensory and psychological detail toward a powerful closure. The ending is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, where Lyra’s purpose is transformed from victimhood to healing, with the abandoned strap symbolizing the foreclosed path. The psychological causality is tight, and the cost of endured trauma is deeply felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional and integral, not decorative. The ultraviolet forest is a perfect "objective correlative" for the protagonist's unique perception, functioning as both penance and sanctuary. The pewter strap also acts as a powerful micro-setting, constraining her initial actions and charging the final image through its absence. This element is a masterclass in worldbuilding-as-character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The central, internal stake—whether Lyra will remain a victim of her trauma or repurpose it—is established immediately and escalated with psychological precision. The tightening point, her realization about "inverse equations," is a powerful internal turn driven by her agency. The resolution is earned, with the cost being the acceptance and repurposing of her permanent, painful alterations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of transforming suffering into healing through a mathematical metaphor is potent and well-developed. However, the final paragraphs drift into thematic summary, explicitly stating what the preceding action already showed ("This was her penance, then—not punishment but transformation."). This over-articulation slightly undermines the resonance of the final image, warranting a deduction for thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story's voice is its defining strength, with a distinct perceptual signature that is both clinical and visceral. The tight third-person POV uses Lyra's enhancements to create a unique narrative texture, making concepts like "the geometry of survival" feel concrete. The prose rhythm and diction are controlled flawlessly, modulating with her internal state and culminating in a powerful final line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with strong verbs and specific imagery. Line-level craft is very high, particularly in the opening paragraphs. A minor deduction is applied for the repeated "mathematics of X" phrasing, which, while central to the theme, begins to feel like a recurring scaffold that slightly over-explains the core metaphor in the story's second half.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>While the "super-soldier's enhancements become a curse" is a known trope, the story transforms it with remarkable ingenuity. The focus on proprioception and the central metaphor of mathematical reciprocals provide a fresh, deeply intelligent angle. The synthesis of high-concept sci-fi with an intimate psychological journey feels both original and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
