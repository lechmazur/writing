<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and her unique characterization as a "pacifist who fought battles through frequency" is well-established. However, the epiphany feels slightly unearned and overly articulated. The line "Mara understood suddenly..." tells the realization rather than fully embodying it, making the internal shift feel more like a sudden insight than a deeply struggled-for change in a high-pressure moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure toward a clear closure unit. The final Conceptual Repricing, where the diary's purpose is re-contextualized as a lesson in empathy, is on-page and carries a felt conceptual cost—the weight of her grandmother's legacy. The structure is elegant and perfectly scaled for the word count, with a strong link between the inciting incident and the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, moving beyond mere atmosphere to become an active participant in the story's climax. The workshop's specific contents—"military radios, Victorian music boxes, and Tibetan singing bowls"—are not just descriptive color; they constrain her methods and "chimed in harmony" at the resolution. This integration of setting into the core causal chain is exemplary and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—opening the diary—is clear and propelled by the ticking clock of New Year's Eve. The pressure deepens effectively as Mara fine-tunes the frequency, a strong representation of escalation under an Accumulative lens. The resolution is driven by her agency (the final adjustment), and the cost is the legible shift from a technical puzzle to a profound emotional and ethical inheritance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of empathy as a tunable frequency is powerful and well-integrated into the premise. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its theme in the final act. The grandmother's quote and the narrator's final summary ("empathy, like frequency, was something you could learn to adjust") feel like a thematic echo, undermining the resonance that was already powerfully built through image and action. This overt moralizing prevents the theme from achieving its full potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is flawlessly maintained, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on sound, frequency, and silence. The narrative voice is controlled, literary, and modulates effectively with the rising tension. The prose as a reflection of character is particularly strong; her way of seeing the world through wavelengths feels authentic and consistent from the first sentence to the last.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. Figurative language, such as "starlight like scattered coins" and "static crackled like distant applause," is effective and integrated. There is a slight tendency toward summary and abstraction in the final two paragraphs, where the prose shifts from embodying the moment to explaining its significance, which slightly dulls the momentum of the otherwise excellent line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core concept is highly original, synthesizing Victorian-era technology, acoustic science, and thematic explorations of empathy in a memorable way. The idea of a "resonance lock" that responds not to a key but to the frequency of a collective human emotion—anticipation—is ingenious and thoughtfully executed. This fresh premise elevates the entire narrative beyond familiar tropes.</comment>
