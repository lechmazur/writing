<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara is a compelling archetype, but her interiority remains somewhat flat; she is more a vessel for a unique gift than a character experiencing internal conflict. Her competence is absolute, which slightly lessens the tension of her task. The motivation is clear, but the transformation is external—in the firmware and her pendant—rather than a deeply felt internal shift earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot is a single, elegant arc of revelation and creation, with causality rooted in consistent fantastical rules. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration that gives the ghosts a form of Earned Stasis, lands with a clear conceptual cost (the cracked amber, the new knowledge, the changed laboratory) and a powerful final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's standout achievement. The "Laboratory of Lost Sounds" is a brilliantly realized conceptual space, and details are both evocative and purposeful. The amber pendant functions as a perfect micro-setting, a tool that focuses the conflict and a recurring object that bears the physical cost of the resolution, directly charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The central stake—giving peace to digital ghosts—is established immediately and deepens effectively. The escalation from static to a "map of... pain" is a masterful execution of pressure under a textural drive. The protagonist's agency is demonstrated in the singular, decisive act of creation, and the cost, while subtle, is made tangible in the fractured heirloom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Thematic resonance is exceptional, exploring digital permanence, guilt, and the importance of acknowledgment without a single line of overt moralizing. The core concept is fully integrated into the plot. The final image of the constellation as a "lullaby for the machines we've left behind" is a sublime, non-literal resolution that reweights the entire piece with profound melancholy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice possesses a distinct and consistent "meteor hush" quality—lyrical, measured, and mythic. The point of view is impeccably controlled, filtering the fantastical events through Mara's unique perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but potent, with Dr. Kepler's lines carrying the weight of long observation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished and often beautiful, with high information density in its imagery. However, a few moments verge on over-articulation, summarizing the theme rather than letting the image do the work (e.g., "guilt transformed into acknowledgment"). This minor tendency toward explicit statement slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext in the final beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of ancient mysticism (amber, heirlooms, tattooing) with a deeply modern anxiety (digital ghosts, obsolete code) is highly original and thoughtfully executed. The story transforms the familiar "haunted technology" trope into a poignant meditation on memory. The core concept of tattooing a constellation onto reality itself is a fresh, memorable, and powerful conceit.</comment>
