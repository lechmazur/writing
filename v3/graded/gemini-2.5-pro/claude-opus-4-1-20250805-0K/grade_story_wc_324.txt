<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority occasionally dips into summary with phrases like "a guardian of vulnerable voices." The final paragraph's articulation of her heroism feels like an authorial thematic statement rather than an earned, in-character realization, slightly flattening the emotional arc at its peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story follows a clear and compelling causal chain under a Hybrid (Causal-dominant) lens. Orientation is swift, and the closure—a Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing—lands with force. The deductive leap from the dirge to the specific crime of "harvesting memories" is very rapid, a minor logical compression that slightly weakens an otherwise flawless structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, with the mist-clad atrium functioning as an active atmospheric force rather than a backdrop. Sensory details are specific and purposeful, from the trembling orchid petals to the taste of copper. The key object, the hearing aid, functions as a 'micro-setting' that directly constrains choice and channels the plot, charging the final moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The stakes—the lives of seventeen catatonic residents—are established immediately and escalated brilliantly through the fading photograph. This creates a tangible, visual countdown that tightens the pressure effectively. Mara's final action is a direct and earned response to this pressure, and the cost of failure is palpable throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The theme of protecting memory and voice emerges organically from the plot and imagery. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the story's moral ("sometimes heroism was incidental..."), a "Thematic Echo" that replaces earned resonance with direct summary. This significantly undermines the powerful ambiguity built earlier by explaining what should have been felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, and the narrative voice has a distinct, literary texture. The prose modulates effectively with the rising tension, and the perceptual signature is specific to Mara's unique abilities. Minor moments of overly polished self-description slightly interrupt the otherwise immersive voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The line-level craft is strong, characterized by evocative imagery and a confident rhythm, with no significant prose artifacts or loops. Sentences are dense with information and atmosphere. The piece is held back from a higher score only by the final paragraph, which shifts from showing to telling in a way that feels less elegant than the preceding prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise of a "contact tracer for hearts" who tracks "emotional contagions" is highly original and thoughtfully executed. It synthesizes paranormal investigation, audiology, and public health into a fresh and compelling concept. The story commits fully to its unique logic, resulting in a memorable and distinctive narrative.</comment>
