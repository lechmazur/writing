<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's characterization is exceptional, with her potter's past providing a consistent and specific lens for her interiority, actions, and perception ("movements precise as throwing porcelain"). Her motivation is clear and compelling, driving the entire narrative. The integration of her past profession into her present mindset feels seamless, making her a unique and memorable individual rather than a generic post-apocalyptic survivor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story operates under a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure is elegant in its simplicity: arrival, investigation, revelation. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, where the understanding of the oasis redefines the rules of survival in this fractured world. The cost is legible in her acceptance of a long wait for the world to heal, making the final earned stasis of the oasis deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is the story's triumph, functioning as both antagonist (wasteland) and central mystery (oasis). The selective sensory details are masterful, from the "cracked earth" to the "faint golden tint" on the glass. The lantern glass itself serves as a crucial micro-setting, constraining perception and charging the final image, easily satisfying the 9+ gate. This is a world rendered with purposeful, poetic precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The conflict is primarily intellectual and spiritual, fitting the Accumulative/Textural lens perfectly. The dominant stake—to understand—is established immediately and intensifies not through external threat, but through the deepening mystery signaled by the glass's thrumming. The climax is a shift in knowledge, and the cost is the quiet burden of that knowledge, an earned resolution that forecloses immediate action in favor of profound understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of gentle, patient harmony as an anchor against chaos is beautifully developed through the interwoven motifs of pottery, beekeeping, and solar rhythms. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The one minor weakness is the line "phototropic to kindness," which verges on being an overly explicit thematic statement, slightly abstracting an otherwise grounded and emergent theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly sustained, creating a meditative and melancholic atmosphere that defines the piece. The POV is flawlessly controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Mei's past as a potter. The prose has a specific texture and rhythm that modulates with the intensity of the scene, showcasing high-level authorial control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong, clear images. Rhythm and syntax are varied to great effect. The score is held back from the highest tier by a single, jarring phrase: "phototropic to kindness." This is a register drift into scientific jargon that clashes with the organic, craft-based lexicon established for the character and story, creating a moment of authorial intrusion in an otherwise immersive piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-apocalyptic setting with fractured timelines, the zen-like discipline of pottery, and the quiet harmony of beekeeping is brilliantly original. The story transforms familiar tropes into something deeply personal and philosophical. The core concept—that harmonious attunement to natural cycles can create a temporal anchor—is an ingenious and memorable premise executed with complete conceptual integrity.</comment>
