<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The character's motivation is compelling and consistent, creating a powerful central irony. However, some interiority is conveyed through summary ("wasn't proud of her past") rather than being fully embodied in contradictory in-scene impulses. The core transformation is earned, but relies more on reflection than on-page choices under immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story uses a reflection-led structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens masterfully. The present-moment discovery serves as a frame that is charged and re-contextualized by the backstory. The closure is a potent Charged Poise, where Mira's new purpose crystallizes with a clear, felt cost ("scarred hands," her solitary future) on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is both atmospheric ("air tasted of copper and centuries") and functionally critical to the plot. The archive and its contents aren't just a backdrop; they are the objective. The tapestry fragments act as a micro-setting that constrains the central action and directly charges the final, resonant image of Mira's new purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing a lost legacy—is signaled immediately and undergoes a significant deepening when the "promise" is revealed to be a technology for imperishable memory, not just a historical record. This escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in decoding the fragments, and the resolution lands with the clear cost of her isolation and new burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story explores its themes of creation-through-destruction and the nature of truth with subtlety and depth. The final image of "destruction and creation unified in her scarred hands" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. A minor deduction is for a slightly too-explicit thematic statement near the end ("humanity's stolen capacity to make truth permanent"), which verges on summarizing the core idea.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The close third-person POV is expertly controlled, with a distinct and consistent voice that feels both intelligent and obsessive. The perceptual signature is strong; the narrative notices what Mira would notice—anachronisms, pigments, patterns. The prose rhythm and elevated diction create a cohesive and memorable narrative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and dense, with striking phrases like "volcanic tenderness" and "lava cooling into new earth." The line-level craft is strong, with varied syntax and clear momentum. Some minor phrases like "analytically intuitive mind" read as labels, slightly flattening the otherwise sharp execution, but the overall effect is polished and powerful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of an arsonist-as-archivist, textile-based data storage, and vandalized art as a map is highly original and compelling. It transforms familiar tropes into a fresh narrative. The story commits fully to its unique premise, and the final reveal feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable.</comment>
