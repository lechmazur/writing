<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is exceptionally clear, evolving from a personal crisis into a profound purpose. Her shift from facing a "death sentence" to accepting an "appointment" is an earned epiphany, driven by the concrete actions of her work. Her interiority is rendered with precision, moving from the initial sting of diagnosis to the "brazen calm" of her final understanding, embodying a complete and credible character arc within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story follows a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building knowledge and atmosphere until its powerful conclusion. The closure is a perfect Conceptual Repricing: Mira's death is re-contextualized not as an end but as a functional, necessary act of translation. The cost is her life, made legible and meaningful on the page, resulting in a resonant and structurally sound narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is not a backdrop but a primary agent in the story. The "living stone pillars" and the orchard function as a coherent entity with which the protagonist interacts, directly constraining her choices and enabling the climax. The final image of the glowing pillars, charged by Mira's work, is a masterclass in integrating setting with plot and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story establishes a profound personal stake—mortality—and masterfully deepens it into a planetary one concerning interspecies communication. The pressure escalates not through overt action but through increasing comprehension, forcing Mira to crystallize her stance against the impending "remodel." The cost—her life—is the ultimate price, and its willing acceptance at the end makes the resolution both powerful and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of death as a form of communication rather than an end emerges organically from the story’s unique premise. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about purpose in the face of mortality. A minor deduction for lines like "offering to share their immortality secrets," which verge on stating the theme too explicitly in an otherwise subtle narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is executed with masterful control, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that mirrors Mira’s emotional journey. The voice possesses a distinct perceptual signature, focusing on the subtle energies of the orchard, and its calm, literary tone is perfectly suited to the material. The prose rhythm modulates effectively from the story’s sharp opening to its serene, patient conclusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The prose is elegant, dense, and precise from the opening sentence. Figurative language, such as "salt spray on a windless day," is both original and functionally evocative. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves to build the intricate world and advance Mira's internal state with unwavering clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core concept—a terminal illness as a biological key for interspecies translation—is exceptionally original, transforming familiar tropes of the "dying sage" and "ancient wisdom." The synthesis of botanical, geological, and bio-electromagnetic ideas feels both fresh and inevitable in hindsight. This is a memorable and intellectually daring story that commits fully to its unique premise.</comment>
