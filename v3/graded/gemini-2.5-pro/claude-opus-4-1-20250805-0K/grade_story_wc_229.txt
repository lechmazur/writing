<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is intensely clear and embodied. The internal conflict—purifying grief into forgiving love—drives the entire plot. However, the story leans on abstract, high-flown emotional labels like "screaming tenderness" (used twice) and "gentle violence," which slightly dilute the specificity of her interiority at peak moments instead of letting the action carry the full weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The structure is a model of economy for this length, using a single continuous scene to achieve a powerful Decisive Change. The Hybrid (Accumulative-Causal) lens is held perfectly: textural details like the jasmine scent accumulate pressure for a clear, cause-and-effect magical climax. The closure lands with a resonant cost—their new state is "beyond death or life"—making the transformation feel earned and significant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as a crucible for the story's magic and emotion. The cobalt lighthouse isn't just a backdrop; its ancient pulse, peeling paint, and sweeping beam are integrated into the action. The beam’s role in making Thomas substantial is a masterful touch, where the environment directly constrains and enables the final, impossible choice, charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story establishes the dominant stake—reuniting with Thomas—and escalates the pressure effectively. The key tightening occurs not through an external obstacle, but an internal one: Mara's realization that she must release Thomas from his guilt, not just summon him. This shift in tactics, driven by her agency, makes the final resolution feel earned, and the cost of their new, liminal existence is poignantly clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of love as both a prison and a form of salvation is developed with nuance. The story avoids a simple moral, landing on a complex resolution that redefines being. The final image of two shadows powerfully answers the story's central question about grief and connection. A slight deduction for the final line's phrase "gentle violence," which feels like a thematic summary nudging the reader toward an interpretation already evident in the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyrical, elevated voice is consistent and creates a potent, otherworldly atmosphere. The POV remains tightly focused on Mara, and her perceptions are colored by her grief and magical intent, creating a distinct narrative signature. The prose rhythm and heightened diction serve the story's mythic quality well, though a few phrases verge on being self-consciously poetic rather than arising organically from Mara's state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is frequently stunning, particularly in its sensory details and opening image. However, a few key phrases are repeated ("screaming tenderness") or lean into abstraction ("luminous with protective love, fractured by guilt"), creating minor artifacts that slightly dull the otherwise sharp line-level craft in peak beats. These moments of overwriting prevent an otherwise excellent piece from achieving flawless propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>While the premise of loving a ghost is familiar, the story transforms the trope through its specific, internally consistent magical system and, most importantly, its resolution. The choice to create a new, shared liminal state rather than having one character cross over to the other's world is a fresh and resonant turn. This synthesis of grief, magic, and setting feels both particular and inevitable.</comment>
