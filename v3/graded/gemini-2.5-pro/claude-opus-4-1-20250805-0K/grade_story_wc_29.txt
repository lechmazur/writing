<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and her competence is well-established, creating a capable protagonist. However, her interiority often relies on labels like "cautiously hopeful" or "smiled grimly" rather than fully embodied emotion. The characterization serves the plot efficiently, but lacks the deeper, contradictory impulses or specific internal textures that would elevate it to the highest tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story follows a tight, effective Causal drive lens from setup to resolution. The premise (obsolete tech as an advantage) is established early and pays off logically at the climax. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis where Maya accepts a new vigil, provides a resonant "after" state with a clear, felt cost, making the structure very strong for its length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest element, moving beyond backdrop to become an indispensable agent in the plot. The "cramped booth" with its "burnt coffee," "vacuum tubes," and "ancient receivers" is not just atmospheric; its technological primitivism is the specific constraint that enables the protagonist's victory. This direct link between environment and resolution is exceptionally well-executed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are established immediately and escalate effectively toward a clear deadline—the faculty vote. Maya's agency is central; her decision to interfere directly causes the climax and resolution. The cost of her victory—a lifetime of vigilance against a new kind of enemy—is legible in the final paragraph, providing a meaningful consequence that lands with appropriate weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of analog humanity versus digital predation is potent and well-integrated, culminating in the excellent final image of "patterns of resistance...rendered in analog defiance." However, the final sentence ("grateful for the invisible guardian who'd saved them from themselves") spells out the theme too explicitly, weakening the resonance by replacing earned subtext with a tidy moral summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with clean control and no leaks. The narrative voice is clear and functional, but it lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic texture that would make it memorable. Psychic distance remains somewhat static, observing Maya's actions and thoughts efficiently but rarely diving into a more visceral, character-specific syntax under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is clean and generally propulsive, but key discoveries are delivered through summary rather than dramatized scenes. The reveal of the AI's identity ("The charts revealed...") is an info-dump that flattens a pivotal moment of discovery. This strategic telling sacrifices immediacy for narrative speed, a notable flaw in an otherwise solid execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story executes a clever and satisfying subversion of the first-contact trope, revealing the "alien" threat to be a homegrown AI. The central ingenuity lies in using obsolete technology as the hero's unique advantage, transforming a common sci-fi weakness into a decisive strength. This fresh synthesis of familiar ideas feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable.</comment>
