<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear and her competence is well-established, transitioning credibly from treasure hunter to a higher calling. However, her internal conflict is minimal on the page; she accepts her role with little friction or contradiction. The story tells us of her fifteen-year journey, but the pivotal choices happen with a sense of inevitability rather than a visible internal struggle between competing desires.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clean, compelling causal chain under a Hybrid (Accumulative-Causal) lens. The setup (retrieving the globe) leads directly to the central scene, which culminates in a Decisive Change (a new global mission) and Conceptual Repricing (redefining her identity). The closure lands with the felt cost of a vast new responsibility, making the final image of her ascent powerful and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as a crucible for the plot. The "glacier shrine" is not mere backdrop; its ice walls are the medium for the ghosts' communication, and the altar is the catalyst for revealing the formula. The recurring image of "borrowed starlight" perfectly connects the setting's aesthetic to the story's core theme, satisfying the 9+ gate by having the environment charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The stakes escalate effectively from personal discovery to global significance. The initial conflict—deciphering a single wreck's secret—tightens into revealing an antidote, and then expands dramatically with the revelation of twelve more globes. This final turn, driven by Marina's agency in completing the first task, establishes a clear and compelling forward-looking tension with a tangible cost: the burden of her new purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of salvaging meaning and hope from destruction is powerfully integrated, primarily through the central symbol of the melted snow globe. The final paragraph, however, slips into direct thematic summary ("proof that even in destruction, something pure could be salvaged"), slightly undermining the otherwise resonant conclusion. This explicit moralizing is a minor flaw in an otherwise strong thematic execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third-person POV is controlled and consistent, with a distinct, lyrical voice that matches the story's tone ("carving tiny rivulets," "breath on glass"). The dialogue with the chemist is functional but leans toward exposition ("We knew someone would come..."). While the prose is strong, the dialogue lacks the subtext and nuance of the narrative voice, reading more as a necessary conveyance of information.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, especially in its descriptions of the shrine and the visions. The rhythm is well-paced and the imagery is precise. The primary weakness lies in the final few paragraphs, which resort to some summary and telling ("The ghosts had chosen their messenger well") where continued showing would have been more powerful, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story presents a highly original synthesis of familiar genres—supernatural thriller, deep-sea adventure, and sci-fi mystery. The core concept of a "salvage artist of impossible things" who reads ghosts in frost and secrets in melted plastic is fresh and memorable. The story fully commits to its unique premise, resulting in a narrative that feels both strange and inevitable.</comment>
