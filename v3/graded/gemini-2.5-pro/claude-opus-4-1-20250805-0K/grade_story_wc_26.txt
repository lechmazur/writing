<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is exceptionally clear, evolving from professional curiosity to profound personal purpose. The final micro-choice to transcribe her grandmother's vision is earned through the preceding investigation and the emotional weight of the climax. The interiority is concrete, especially the "luminous regret," which feels specific and earned rather than a stock emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure is tight, building density through observations across decades. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, as Mira’s purpose is redefined, and the cost is the palpable "luminous regret" on the page. All causality is sound within this non-linear, evidence-gathering framework.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is a standout achievement, both imaginative and integral. The "blooming library" is a unique and evocative world. Critically, the "river stone" functions as a micro-setting element that constrains a key choice—placing it on the desk—and powerfully charges the story's final, resonant image, meeting the highest standard for this category.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates excellent control of stakes, deepening them from an intellectual puzzle to a profound spiritual and professional calling. The pressure escalates beautifully when the shadow metamorphoses, transforming the nature of the conflict. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution, and the cost—the weight of her grandmother's long wait—is emotionally legible and resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of intergenerational hope is potent and emerges organically from the central images. The final image of the stone's shadow is a superb, non-literal resolution. However, the line "Mira had discovered that hope itself could metamorphose..." is an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the earned resonance of the climax, functioning as a thematic echo where an image would suffice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with perfect discipline. The voice is distinctive and lyrical, fitting the setting and character without becoming overwrought. The prose has a clear perceptual signature, filtering the fantastic setting through Mira's patient, observant nature, and the narrative distance modulates effectively to heighten the climactic vision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and largely pristine, with high information density. Sentences like "The shadow had been migrating, untethered from physical law, seeking something" are clean and propulsive. A minor weakness is the tendency toward summary in the penultimate paragraph (e.g., "knowing that..."), which slightly shifts from showing to telling at a crucial moment of resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of high-concept science fiction (dream-sharing library) with a subtle, almost mystical core mystery (the migrating shadow of a dream) is highly original and seamlessly executed. The concept feels unique and emotionally authentic, transforming familiar tropes about legacy and memory into something fresh and memorable. The story's vision is singular and fully realized.</comment>
