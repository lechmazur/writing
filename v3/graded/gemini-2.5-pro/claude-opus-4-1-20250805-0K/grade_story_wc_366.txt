<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elsa's characterization is strong and consistent; her reticence is not a flaw but the specific quality needed for the resolution, which is an excellent turn. Her motivation is clear and her final choice feels earned. The line "She could be alone without becoming lonely" is slightly too diagnostic, an intellectual summary rather than an embodied realization in the moment, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story follows a clear and compelling causal structure under a Hybrid (Causal/Situational) lens. Orientation is immediate and effective. The closure unit—Elsa's acceptance and relighting of the lamp—is a Decisive Change with a clear, felt cost (her old life for this eternal duty). The final image of her stacking stones for the ghosts provides a powerful, resonant conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is superb, functioning as a character in its own right. The lighthouse is rendered with palpable atmosphere, and key objects—the stones and the sea glass—act as potent micro-settings that directly constrain choice and charge the final image. The sensory details are selective and purposeful, perfectly reflecting the story's tone and Elsa's internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—the fate of the lonely souls and Elsa's potential role as their guardian—is signaled early and escalates effectively. The stone message provides a meaningful tightening of pressure. The final conflict is resolved through Elsa's direct agency in choosing her new purpose, and the cost of this choice is legible and permanent. The escalation is perfectly scaled for the story's length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of purposeful solitude versus corrosive loneliness is beautifully developed through character and action. However, the second-to-last paragraph slips into thematic summary ("one who understood that protecting others sometimes meant standing alone..."). This explicit declaration slightly undermines the resonant power of the final scene, which already demonstrates the theme perfectly without needing the explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The limited third-person POV is controlled with masterful precision. The narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that is consistent and modulates effectively with the rising tension and emotional depth of the climax. Dialogue is sparse but potent, and the transition to the ghosts' non-verbal speech is handled seamlessly. The prose beautifully reflects Elsa’s perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and evocative for most of the story. The rhythm and word choice create a powerful sense of place and mood. The final sentence, "their tears falling like sea glass into the waiting ocean," feels like a slightly forced echo of an earlier motif, a bit of overwriting that gilds the lily. This, combined with the thematic summary in the preceding paragraph, slightly dulls the otherwise sharp ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>While the haunted lighthouse is a familiar trope, the story transforms it with significant ingenuity. The concept of loneliness as the haunting force, and of a solitary guardian as the cure rather than an exorcist, is a fresh and emotionally intelligent angle. The specific details, especially the language of stones, lend the story a memorable and particular feel that is anything but generic.</comment>
