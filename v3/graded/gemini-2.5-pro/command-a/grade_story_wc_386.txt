<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies on familiar phrasing like "a tapestry woven from the fragments of others’ stories." While her competence is well-established, the character lacks a compelling internal conflict or contradictory impulse; she is a vessel for the story's discovery process rather than a character transformed by it. Her emotional state is fitting but not deeply textured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building its narrative through discovered fragments. The structure is sound, with clear orientation and a well-defined process leading to the closure. The final Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elara completes her work, provides a satisfying cadence, though the globe momentarily clearing feels like a slightly too-convenient magical grace note.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a standout success. The "candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice" is not only vividly rendered but also functional, creating an atmosphere of sacred isolation that enables the narrative's core ritual. The melted snow globe serves as a powerful micro-setting that constrains the central mystery and charges the final, resonant image, meeting the criteria for exceptional integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving voice to the voiceless—is established early and pursued consistently. The conflict is primarily metaphysical, pitting Elara's method against the obscurity of the past. Pressure deepens effectively as informational fragments accumulate, leading to the emotional climax. The resolution is earned within this quiet framework, though it lacks a sharp reversal or a tangible, unexpected cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of preserving memory against time and tragedy emerges organically from the story’s actions and central image. The piece skillfully avoids overt moralizing, culminating in a final image of the restored village and the dawn that offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions. The motivation statement "to salvage something pure" borders on being too explicit but doesn't detract from the otherwise subtle execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is lyrical and consistent with the story's mystical tone. Phrases like "a place of borrowed starlight" are effective in establishing atmosphere. However, the voice occasionally leans on well-worn lyrical constructions and lacks a truly distinct or surprising perceptual signature that would elevate it to the highest tier.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is clean and often evocative, but it is held back by minor-yet-noticeable flaws. Moments of telling ("The object felt heavy... in the secrets it carried") and stock phrasing ("her motivation burned brighter") soften the impact. While free of significant errors, the piece lacks the consistent line-level propulsion and information density required for a top-tier score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The core premise of a "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" who uses dream analysis is a fresh and compelling synthesis of familiar genres. This ingenuity in the setup provides a strong foundation. While the plot follows a relatively straightforward path of discovery, the originality of the character's profession and method makes the story feel memorable and distinctive.</comment>
