<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, driving the narrative from a quiet obsession to a high-stakes moral decision. Her final choice is earned by her established character. However, the internal conflict leading to this choice is more summarized ("She had to make a choice") than dramatized, slightly flattening the emotional climax of her journey from passive keeper to active agent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows a tight, effective Causal lens, with each discovery logically leading to the next. The closure is a Decisive Change with a clear, felt cost. The structure is undermined by the central convenience of the numbers '10.17.23' serving as a timestamp, coordinates, and a safe combination; this degree of coincidence strains credulity at a pivotal point, making the discovery feel less earned and more constructed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atmosphere of "sensed absence" is brilliantly established in the archive and contrasted with the derelict warehouse. The setting is more than a backdrop; it's the source of the conflict and the means of resolution. The physical patch is a perfect "micro-setting" object that charges the final image ("the weight of the embroidered patch in her palm"), satisfyingly grounding the digital mystery in a tangible reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the truth versus maintaining personal safety—is signaled early and escalates effectively under a Causal lens. Each discovery tightens the pressure, narrowing Elara's options from an intellectual puzzle to a dangerous reality. The final choice carries a clear, legible cost (her career and safety), making the resolution impactful and earned through her direct agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of memory versus erasure is woven organically into the plot, culminating in a resonant final image of the "complete" archive. The story's central question finds a powerful, non-literal answer. However, the final paragraph veers into thematic summary ("Where do deleted files go? They go to the bottom of the digital sea..."), a moment of telling that slightly diminishes the power of the preceding scene work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The point of view is flawlessly maintained, with a consistent narrative distance that suits the introspective, observant protagonist. Elara's perceptual signature—her focus on gaps, ghosts, and absences—gives the prose a distinct and compelling texture. The voice modulates effectively from quiet curation to the high tension of the final decision without any slips in register or control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is clean, concise, and propulsive. Figurative language, like the archive as a "mausoleum" and the data leak as a "supernova," is generally effective and well-integrated. The piece is slightly weakened by a few cliché phrases in the final moments, such as the truth's "roar that echoed through the halls of power," which feels less specific and crafted than the story's strong opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While the "evil corporation covers up its crimes" plot is a familiar genre staple, the story makes it fresh through its unique framing within a social network archive. The concept of a "corporate memory keeper" as a digital detective is an ingenious synthesis. The story's originality lies in its execution and atmosphere rather than its core plot, which relies on the slightly contrived clue of the multi-purpose numbers.</comment>
