<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is intriguing and bookends the story well, but her pivotal shift from professional cartographer to custodian of a legacy feels asserted rather than earned. The line "the legacy's burden...settled onto her shoulders" is a summary of an internal change, not a dramatization of it. While her actions are consistent, the core emotional transformation lacks the granularity and embodied contradiction expected at the highest level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens. The progression from survey to discovery to resolution is logical and well-paced for the length. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "what walls dream about," lands with a clear felt cost ("the burden...now hers to carry"). The only minor weakness is the convenience of the "sighing corner" being a term from Elara's own niche profession, which slightly softens the challenge of the discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as both atmosphere and antagonist ("slowly digested by the relentless green"). Specificity is strong, from the "dappled green" light to the "marble mantel cracked by root and frost." Crucially, an element of the setting—the acoustic anomaly of the "sighing corner"—is not just descriptive but becomes the primary constraint that enables the climax, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story effectively signals and then deepens the stakes, moving from a professional task to a profound moral responsibility. The discovery of the diaries provides a strong tightening of pressure, reorienting the protagonist's goal. The final cost, the acceptance of the legacy's burden, is legible and earned by her actions. The conflict is primarily intellectual, but its resolution carries significant emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of memory, legacy, and what endures is beautifully integrated and resolved. The story's initial thematic question—"what walls dream about"—receives a powerful, non-literal answer in the final image of the negative. This final image recontextualizes the entire narrative, providing a resonant Conceptual Repricing without resorting to a simplistic moral. The execution is elegant and impactful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and well-suited to the melancholic, observant tone. The prose has a clear perceptual signature, filtering the world through Elara's unique sensitivities to sound and space. Psychic distance is controlled effectively, drawing the reader close to Elara's internal state without overwrought exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery. However, there are occasional moments of telling where showing would be more powerful (e.g., the "legacy's burden settled onto her shoulders"). The final sentence feels slightly less sharp than the rest of the piece, summarizing the new state rather than leaving it resonant in the final image alone. These are minor issues in an otherwise strong performance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise of a "corridor echo cartographer" is highly original and provides a fresh lens for a story about memory and loss. The synthesis of a post-climate-shift setting with a gothic-style discovery plot is ingenious. The story transforms the familiar trope of preserving a family history into something unique through its specific sensory details and the wonderfully satisfying answer to its central, whimsical question.</comment>
