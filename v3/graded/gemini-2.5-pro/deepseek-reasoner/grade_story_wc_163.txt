<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is immediately clear and specific, driving the entire internal arc. Her panic is embodied convincingly (“tightening her chest until her breath came in short, sharp gasps”), avoiding diagnostic labels. The final shift from trauma-anchor to earned peace feels credible, earned through the scene's central event rather than a sudden, unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story follows an elegant Accumulative/Textural structure. The feather's arrival provides a clear inciting incident that logically progresses to a crisis point. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elara's internal state is reweighted with a felt cost—accepting loss coexists with wonder. The final line, "a quiet heart alongside her own," provides a definitive after-state, making the change legible and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as a crucible for the character's internal state. The "pressurized labyrinth" and the "dome of absolute black" are not just backdrops; they constrain Elara's choices and directly shape the climax on the observatory platform. This environment is an indispensable element that both causes the problem (isolation) and provides the stage for its resolution, fully charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The central stake—Elara’s internal battle for peace against a traumatic memory—is established instantly and escalates with palpable pressure. The appearance of the fireflies deepens the conflict by introducing a counterpoint to her dread, forcing a shift in her attention. The resolution is achieved through her agency in witnessing, and the cost is clear: she finds belonging not by erasing the past, but by integrating it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of finding beauty and connection in the midst of loss emerges organically from the story’s central imagery: the burnt feather versus the living lights. The final paragraph risks being slightly too explicit in its summary of the theme, but it reads as an earned internal realization rather than authorial moralizing. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's search for belonging.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical, precise, and perfectly suited to a "Landscape Astrologer." The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through Elara's specific, pattern-seeking lens. Psychic distance is masterfully controlled, drawing the reader tightly into her panic and then easing into a shared, quiet observation, reflecting her emotional journey through its rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished, with high information density and a strong, evocative rhythm. Sentences like "The water beyond was a dome of absolute black, a negative image of the night sky" are vivid and efficient. The score is slightly tempered by the jarring inclusion of the foreign word "缝合" mid-sentence, which reads as an uncorrected artifact and momentarily breaks the immersive flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise of an underwater astrologer is highly original and beautifully executed. The story synthesizes a sci-fi setting with a quiet, psychological conflict, transforming a familiar trauma narrative into something fresh and memorable. The central image of deep-sea fireflies is a striking, ingenious conceit that feels both magical and scientifically plausible within the story's world.</comment>
