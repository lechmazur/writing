<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is sharp and her interiority is consistent, with her “cautiously hopeful” state providing a clear internal conflict that drives the plot. The transition from that caution to a “steadier, stronger” hope at the end is earned through her decisive action. The characterization is strong, slightly held back by moments where emotional states are labeled rather than purely embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story follows a tight, effective Causal lens, where each step logically follows from the last. The plot structure is clean, moving from problem to plan to execution without deviation. The closure is an excellent example of Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), landing on a quiet, powerful final image with a clear, felt cost of exhaustion and vigilance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The university radio station is more than a backdrop; it's an essential toolset that enables the entire resolution. The "massive dish" is not ornamental but the central instrument of the climax, directly constraining and facilitating the protagonist's choice. The atmosphere of societal tension outside contrasts effectively with the focused chaos inside the station, charging the final image of the quieted town.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The stakes—psychological warfare threatening societal collapse—are established early and feel significant. Pressure escalates effectively from a town-wide problem to a personal one as Elara’s colleagues divide, forcing her to act alone. Her final gamble is a decisive, high-agency move that directly resolves the conflict with the legible cost of immense personal strain and risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of subtle warfare requiring a subtle defense ("not with a shout, but with a whisper") is elegant and consistently woven through the narrative. The story avoids a simplistic moral. However, the final paragraph verges on over-explanation, explicitly stating how the counter-frequency worked ("it had inoculated them"), slightly diminishing the resonance by summarizing what could have been left implicit in the image of the town's relief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a voice that is both scientifically precise and emotionally resonant, perfectly suiting the character. The narrative distance is stable, and the internal monologue feels authentic to a specialist under pressure. The prose has a distinct and consistent texture throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is clean, with strong verbs and evocative images like "the audio equivalent of a lockpick." Momentum is well-maintained. The score is slightly reduced due to a prose artifact at the climax and resolution, where the narrative shifts from showing the effects to telling the mechanics ("The divisive anger, she realized, had been artificially amplified..."). This summary flattens the discovery in a pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story offers a highly original take on a first-contact scenario, transforming the trope from a physical conflict into one of psychological warfare and resonant frequencies. The specific solution—a subsonic, feeling-based countermeasure—is both ingenious and thematically satisfying. This fresh angle, executed with conceptual integrity, makes the story feel memorable and intelligent.</comment>
