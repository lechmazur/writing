<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is established clearly and drives her actions consistently. However, her interiority reads as more of a skilled professional's process than a deeply felt internal struggle. Emotions are often labeled ("she felt his terror, his regret") rather than fully embodied, and she faces no significant internal conflict or contradiction in her methods, which limits character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear and effective causal structure (Hybrid, leaning Causal), with the discovery of the truth directly enabling the resolution. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration on the page, where the ghost finds peace and the shrine's atmosphere changes, leaving a felt cost in the form of the now-inert object. The plot is impeccably structured but lacks a complication or reversal that would test the protagonist's methods, making the progression feel somewhat frictionless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a significant strength, with the candle-lit glacier shrine providing a potent, tangible atmosphere that is more than just a backdrop. The environment actively participates in the story's closure, as the oppressive cold lifts and the "borrowed" light becomes "earned," directly mirroring the ghost's resolution. The melted snow globe also functions as an effective micro-setting, constraining the ghost's spirit and charging the final dream sequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—the officer's spiritual peace—is clear and resolved with protagonist agency. The narrative deepens effectively when the nature of the officer's regret is recontextualized from cowardice to an unfinished act of love. However, the conflict lacks significant opposition; Elara's methods work flawlessly without any risk of failure or unforeseen obstacles, which lessens the overall tension and sense of a hard-won victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of salvaging pure intent from ruin is beautifully integrated, emerging organically from the story’s events and culminating in a resonant final image. The story largely trusts its imagery to convey meaning, but the final paragraph veers close to summarizing its own theme ("the pure thing she salvaged was his intent, his love, finally delivered"). This moment of direct statement slightly undermines the subtext, preventing the piece from achieving flawless thematic execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control, and the narrative voice is lyrical and assured. However, the voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature, occasionally slipping into a more explanatory, authorial tone that states the symbolic meaning of an object ("a perfect, ruined metaphor"). This slightly flattens the voice and creates a small psychic distance from Elara's immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose is clean, evocative, and generally demonstrates strong line-level craft with good rhythm and clarity. The piece is weakened by a few instances of conceptual summary where concrete action would be stronger, such as labeling the snow globe a "metaphor." While there are no egregious prose artifacts, these moments of telling over showing slightly reduce the overall momentum and immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story's core premise is highly original, synthesizing the concepts of wreck-diving, ghost whispering, and dream-analysis into a memorable and fresh framework. The execution commits fully to this unique concept, particularly in the method of finding the ghost through dream cameos. While the emotional resolution follows a familiar path of delivering a final message, the inventive mechanics used to get there mark the story as ingenious.</comment>
