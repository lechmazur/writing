<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elvan's transformation from a reticent observer to a committed keeper is powerful, but the internal pivot feels slightly abrupt for a man "not given to fancy." The motivation is driven more by the story's thematic needs than by a dramatized internal struggle, making his ultimate choice feel poetically right but psychologically swift. His established trait of being "warmly observant" does the necessary work to make his investigation credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The structure is exemplary for an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The plot unfolds through a series of discoveries that layer meaning and emotional weight, leading to an inevitable choice. The closure, Elvan's acceptance of his new role, is a clear Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with the felt cost of his former life. Causality is emotional and textural rather than strictly mechanical, which perfectly serves the story.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is the story's strongest element, rendered with precise, evocative details that are deeply integrated into the plot. The lantern room is not just a location but a crucible, with the "cold, dead eye" of the lens and the "moaning" wind actively shaping the conflict. Key objects—the sea glass, the cairn, the logbook—are not mere props; they are essential narrative engines that constrain choice and charge the final, resonant image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear, high-stakes external conflict (a ship is in danger) and deepens it with a poignant internal and supernatural one. The pressure escalates effectively as Elvan uncovers the tragic backstory, culminating in a clear moment of decision driven by his agency. The final resolution is earned, and the cost—Elvan's solitary former life exchanged for a hallowed, shared solitude—is tangible and moving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of duty extending beyond life is beautifully handled through subtext and resonant imagery rather than overt statements. The central concept—a companionship across the veil—emerges organically from the discovered letters. The final image of Elvan building a new cairn is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question of who will tend the light. A slight deduction for the final sentence summarizing the change, which could have been left implicit in the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The point of view is masterfully controlled, with a spare, observational narrative voice that perfectly mirrors Elvan's character. The prose maintains its distinct texture even as the psychic distance closes slightly to accommodate his profound decision at the end. The perceptual signature is consistent and specific; we see this world through the eyes of a quiet, competent man of the sea, which makes his acceptance of the supernatural feel grounded and earned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and concise, with a strong, rhythmic cadence. The line-level craft is mostly excellent, particularly in its sensory details. However, a few moments verge on overwriting, such as the near-synonym pairing of "luminescent ache" and a "sorrow that glowed," which creates a minor conceptual loop. The final paragraph's declarative summary slightly dilutes the power of the preceding actions, telling what was already effectively shown.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>While the haunted lighthouse is a familiar trope, the story revitalizes it with a unique and poignant mechanism: the letter chain between a living keeper and his spectral predecessor. This specific synthesis feels fresh and emotionally authentic. The addition of the cairns as a non-verbal communication system further grounds the supernatural elements in a plausible, regional folk practice, resulting in a memorable and distinctive narrative.</comment>
