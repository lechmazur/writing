<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in an artistic and spiritual yearning that justifies his actions. The concept of a "wordless conversation" with the ghost is well-realized. However, his interiority occasionally relies on familiar abstractions ("something he couldn't name but felt in his bones") rather than a more particular, contradictory inner life, making him feel more like a sensitive vessel for the events than a complex individual under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural drive. Orientation is immediate and clear, and the structure builds logically toward the climax. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), as the final peaceful hush provides a palpable 'after' state. The cost is legible in the dissolution of the antique program, an artifact whose purpose has been fulfilled, providing a satisfying sense of finality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is the story's most powerful element, rendered with vivid, purposeful sensory detail. The flooded opera house is not mere backdrop; the water creates the musical code on the program, and the miraculously preserved piano provides the means of resolution. This direct constraint and enabling of plot through environment is exemplary, charging every beat and especially the final image of peaceful, still water.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The central stake—completing the ghost's unfinished performance to resolve a spiritual dissonance—is established early and effectively. The pressure deepens texturally, moving from exploration to discovery to the decisive act of performance. The final choice to play the music resolves the conflict with a felt cost (the program's dissolution), earning the final peace. The conflict is primarily atmospheric and internal, which aligns perfectly with the story's chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of art as a bridge between life and death emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the "peaceful, complete" hush serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of the unfinished song. While phrases like "wordless conversation...transcended spoken words" verge on stating the theme directly, they are integrated well enough not to feel like authorial intrusion, allowing the story's central concept to land with grace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice. The perceptual signature fits the artistic character. The inclusion of the untranslated Chinese word "暧昧" is a bold but potentially jarring choice that risks breaking the narrative immersion for a reader unfamiliar with it. While it fits thematically (ambiguity), it feels more like an authorial flourish than a natural part of this specific character's internal voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and often beautiful, but it is hampered by occasional overwriting and repetitive structures. Several sentences rely on stacked binaries ("hauntingly familiar yet utterly alien," "ancient and new") that feel more like conceptual placeholders than precise descriptions. A few passages fall into a template cadence ("flickering lanterns casting dancing shadows," "keys gleaming in the lantern light") that slightly dulls the otherwise strong line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>While the "haunted theater" is a familiar trope, the story transforms it through its central conceit: a musical score created by the chance interaction of water and paper. This method of supernatural communication is both original and thematically resonant. The story commits fully to its lyrical, quiet premise, avoiding standard horror or mystery beats in favor of a genuinely poignant and artistically focused resolution.</comment>
