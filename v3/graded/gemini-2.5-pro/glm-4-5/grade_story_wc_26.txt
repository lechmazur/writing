<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation, "to preserve the shape of hope," is clearly stated but feels more like a label than an embodied drive until the final revelation. The emotional shift to "luminous regret" is potent but is followed by several paragraphs of summary that abstract her changed state ("transformed from professional duty to personal mission") rather than showing it through a concrete micro-choice or moment of struggle. Her initial characterization as a meticulous observer is strong and consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, building from observation to a potent Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The closure, where the anomaly is revealed as a loved one, lands with the clear, felt cost of "understanding that comes too late." The causality is sound and the progression feels earned, leading to a powerful reconfiguration of the story's world and stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is both atmospheric and integral to the plot. The "blooming library above the clouds" provides a wonderfully fresh and evocative backdrop. More importantly, the river stone functions as a perfect micro-setting; it grounds Elara, acts as the focal point for the shadow's climactic gesture, and ultimately becomes a "bridge between moments," directly charging the final image and carrying the story's thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The stake is effectively signaled early (understanding the anomaly) and deepens into a profound personal stake at the climax. The pressure escalates well as the shadow moves from a distant phenomenon on screen to a present entity approaching her desk, forcing a confrontation. The resolution carries a clear, legible cost—the permanent weight of her late understanding—which redefines her future work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of love persisting beyond death emerges organically through the central mystery. However, the final five paragraphs abandon subtext and repeatedly state the theme outright. Lines like "...not an anomaly to fear, but love's persistence..." and "...a witness to love's endurance..." are thematic summaries that weaken an otherwise resonant ending by over-explaining it, a significant flaw for a literary piece.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative, speculative tone of the story. POV is controlled, staying tightly with Elara, and her perceptual signature as a "dusk noticer" shapes what details are given focus. The prose effectively conveys her internal state through a quiet, observant narrative stance that modulates well during the moment of revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and evocative for the first two-thirds of the story. However, the final section suffers from significant momentum loss due to repetitive phrasing and summary. The final five paragraphs create a series of paraphrase loops, each restating the story's new thematic resolution without adding new information or pressure, which dulls the impact of the powerful climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core concept—a library of shared dreams where shadows of the dead seek reunion—is highly original and beautifully imagined. The synthesis of a high-concept sci-fi world with an intimate story of personal grief feels fresh and compelling. The story transforms the trope of a haunting into something more poignant and unique, demonstrating a strong, singular vision.</comment>
