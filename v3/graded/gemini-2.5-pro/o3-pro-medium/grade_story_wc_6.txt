<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maia's characterization is exceptional, driven by a compelling internal contradiction that is dramatized through concrete choices, not just summarized. The story effectively embodies her conflict in the physical scar and her professional duty. The final resolution—"I will douse what you lit, but I will not despise the spark that made me"—is a perfectly earned synthesis, achieved through a series of micro-choices that demonstrate a clear hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story's structure is flawless under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered imagery and sensory detail rather than linear plot turns. Orientation is immediate and effective. The closure is a powerful on-page Resonant Reconfiguration, where Maia's internal state is altered with a clear, felt cost represented by her tears and the feeling of "woodsmoke lifting from her skin."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant in the story's resolution. The obsidian lagoon, with its reflective surface and legendary song, directly facilitates the climax, functioning as a tool that allows Maia's "buried song" to be heard. This integration of environment and action is seamless and powerful, easily satisfying the requirement for the setting to constrain choice and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant internal stake—reconciling a destructive inheritance with a protective calling—is established early and deepened effectively. The pressure intensifies through the encounter with the pilgrim, which forces Maia to engage directly with her pain. The resolution is driven by her agency in completing the ritual, and the cost of her emotional breakthrough is made tangible and resonant on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of healing and reconciling contradictory legacies is developed with superb nuance through the central images of fire, water, scars, and grafts. However, the final paragraph veers slightly into thematic summary ("daughters can choose which inheritance to ignite"), stating the moral that the preceding scene had already so beautifully dramatized. This minor instance of telling slightly weakens the powerful resonance of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and sustained, establishing a distinct perceptual signature for Maia. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the story's emotional intensity, from the quiet post-duty calm to the charged atmosphere of the lagoon ritual. POV is tightly controlled, maintaining a close psychic distance that makes Maia's internal journey immediate and compelling without any leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished, dense with striking and original figurative language ("grains run through her fingers like lunar time," "melody was crushed glass and sunrise"). There are no technical flaws, loops, or overwriting; the density is purposeful and serves the story's accumulative method. The sentences propel the narrative with a controlled, poetic rhythm that is both beautiful and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story demonstrates high originality by synthesizing firefighting, a legacy of arson, volcanic geography, and a folk-magic ritual into a cohesive and emotionally resonant whole. It transforms the familiar theme of generational trauma into a unique, specific narrative that feels both strange and deeply true. The core premise is fresh, and its execution avoids all cliché.</comment>
