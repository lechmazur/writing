<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is exceptional, driven by the potent internal conflict between her "preemptively nostalgic longing" and her professional duty. The motivation to "sculpt identity" is tested and refined through a concrete choice. The final act of excising her own yearning is a powerful, earned renunciation with a tangible cost—"The omission stung"—that perfectly resolves her internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Adhering to an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is flawless. The narrative progresses from atmospheric immersion to a specific method, a critical discovery, and a thematically resonant choice. The closure is a superb Resonant Reconfiguration, where Lira's decision redefines the observatory's purpose from a mausoleum to a "promise," with the felt cost of her personal sacrifice solidifying the change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant in the narrative. The "stormlit observatory" and "crystal whispering forecourt" create a potent atmosphere that is both mythic and tangible. Crucially, an element of the setting—the broken sundial—is the direct catalyst for the story's climax, and the forecourt's reaction ("brightened, as though approving") charges the final image, demonstrating perfect integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story masterfully handles a subtle, philosophical conflict: preservation versus petrification. The stake is the very nature of memory itself. Pressure deepens perfectly under an accumulative lens, moving from a technical challenge to a profound moral choice when Lira confronts the "countless faces." The cost of her resolution is made explicit and felt in "The omission stung," providing a satisfying and earned conclusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme is impeccably woven through image and action, exploring the responsibility of the historian/archivist. The mentor's warning against building "mausoleums where seedbeds are needed" serves as a perfect thematic key without being heavy-handed. The final image of the observatory as a "promise" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, leaving a powerful and complex aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The voice is confident, consistent, and highly poetic, establishing a distinct perceptual signature for Lira. The prose's texture and rhythm are controlled, modulating effectively from quiet observation to the dizzying intensity of her vision. Psychic distance is masterfully handled, drawing the reader into Lira's unique, nostalgic, and ultimately rigorous worldview without a single misstep.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious and largely brilliant, with high information density and evocative imagery. Sentences like "thunder unrolled a deepening hush" demonstrate superb craft. However, the density of figurative language occasionally borders on being overwrought, and a slight redundancy ("whispering forecourt after rain") is noticeable, preventing a perfect score but not significantly detracting from the story's power.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>While the "archivist of memories" is a known fantasy trope, the story transforms it with breathtaking specificity and philosophical depth. The unique mechanics of the world—summer-quills, meteor glass obelisks, dating memories by lightning—feel entirely fresh. The core conflict is handled with a nuanced emotional truth that elevates the premise into something singular and memorable.</comment>
