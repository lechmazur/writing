<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maris's motivation is exceptionally clear and her actions are consistent with her defined traits ("logical," "tranquilly perceptive"). Her core competence is balanced with a genuine struggle against the environment. The final choice to stamp the codex under duress is a powerful crystallization of her values, earned by the preceding investigation and demonstrating a clear hierarchy of values with the visible cost of losing access to the library.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story follows a strong, legible Causal drive, with each discovery flowing logically from a prior action. The closure unit is excellent: a Decisive Change (stamping the book) followed by a Conceptual Repricing (the "honest dawn") that lands with a clear, felt cost (the library sealed forever). The persistent constraint of darkness effectively shapes Maris's tactics, forcing her to rely on the very skills that unmask the forgery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully integrated, acting as both obstacle and catalyst. The "sunken city" is not mere backdrop; its failure (the disabled floodgates) directly causes the climactic pressure. Details like "bioluminescent algae" and "coral sinew" are both evocative and functional, while the antique ink stamp functions as a micro-setting that constrains and ultimately resolves the central choice, charging the final image with its mark.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—verifying truth against historical lies—is signaled early and escalated perfectly. The pressure tightens from a general challenge (darkness) to a specific discovery (forgeries), a deeper conspiracy (hidden chamber), and finally an existential threat (the flood). The climax forces a choice driven by Maris's agency, where she affirms her mission at an unmistakable cost, making the resolution feel deeply earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of truth providing stillness in a sea of chaos is beautifully woven through the narrative, culminating in the physical act of stamping the book. However, the final two sentences veer into thematic summary, explicitly labeling the "alternative hypothesis of courage" and the "honest dawn." This slightly overwrought moralizing replaces a more resonant, image-driven conclusion, reducing the subtext's power at the very end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and confident, establishing a clear perceptual signature focused on non-visual senses ("mapped shelves by echo," "compared ink depths by touch"). The prose has a specific, controlled rhythm that reflects Maris's tranquil perceptiveness, even under extreme pressure. The point of view remains impeccably stable, creating a seamless and immersive experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical and dense with strong imagery, particularly in its opening and middle sections. Sentences are well-constructed and propel the narrative forward with a distinct rhythm. The final paragraph, however, becomes slightly overwritten, with figurative language ("inked upon a broken world," "dawn... prepared to open its fragile pages") that feels more abstract and less grounded than the tactile prose that precedes it, slightly dulling the sharpness of the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-apocalyptic, submerged world with the niche, intellectual profession of a "logical page indexer" is highly original and effective. The story transforms the familiar trope of a lone archivist into a high-stakes adventure of tactile espionage. The central conflict's resolution through sensory detail rather than overt action feels fresh, inevitable in hindsight, and fully committed to its unique premise.</comment>
