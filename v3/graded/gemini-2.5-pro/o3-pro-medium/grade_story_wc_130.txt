<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Characterization is superb, with a motivation that is both intellectually abstract and deeply personal. The protagonist's interiority is rendered with stunning precision through the metaphor of mathematics, avoiding all clichés of grief. The final earned stasis, accepting a "continuing function" over a "sum," is a powerful and credible resolution, demonstrating a change earned with palpable emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, where the plot advances through layers of insight rather than external events. The Conceptual Repricing at the climax—redefining the problem of grief instead of solving it—is potent and fully earned. The final image provides a resonant closure that lands with the quiet but undeniable cost of accepting perpetual sorrow as a manageable rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but the central mechanism of the plot and the physical embodiment of the theme. Every element, from the pulsing pomegranates to the dripping stalactites, is integrated into the character's problem-solving and ultimate realization. The cavern orchard functions as a tool that constrains choice and directly charges the final, resonant image of a system brought into harmony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story masterfully handles a purely internal conflict, with the stakes being Eridian's potential slide from sorrow into despair. The central discovery at the mosaic serves as a powerful deepening of the conflict, shifting the terms of the struggle from seeking closure to engineering endurance. The resolution is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency, and the cost—the renunciation of hope for a final answer—is rendered with beautiful clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from the central metaphor of emotional mathematics. It offers a profound and non-obvious take on ambiguous loss, resisting easy sentimentality for a more complex and sustainable truth. The final image of the rhythmic orchard is a perfect, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting all prior material without a single word of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice is singular, consistent, and impeccably controlled, blending a poetic sensibility with intellectual precision. The POV's perceptual signature, filtering the world through mathematics, is the story's defining feature and is sustained beautifully. The narrative distance is perfect, allowing intimacy with Eridian's thoughts without ever slipping into exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The prose is exceptional, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic grace in every line. Figurative language is consistently inventive and purposeful, as in "parabolas resembling smiles and integrals descending like sighs." There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the piece is a masterclass in concision and propulsion, with a final sentence that perfectly captures the story’s thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story is highly original, synthesizing fantasy, mathematics, and psychology into a seamless and memorable whole. It transforms the trope of the reclusive mage by focusing on a deeply human, internal quest. The core premise is executed with such conceptual integrity and emotional honesty that its quiet, intellectual risks pay off with profound resonance, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
