<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Yara's characterization is strong and consistent, with her 'steadily adaptive' nature demonstrated through her clever problem-solving and emotional regulation. Her interiority is specific, rooted in the tactile language of her craft. The only weakness is a slight over-articulation of her internal state near the end, where her purpose becomes a bit too neatly defined ("the awareness that creation and survival shared the same rhythm"), which feels less like an embodied discovery and more like a thematic summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The plot is a masterclass in causal efficiency, with each beat logically building on the last, from the damaged ledger to the ingenious frost solution and the ensuing escape. The structure adheres perfectly to the Causal lens, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Yara's new goal and the immediate danger are crystallized. The closure lands with a palpable, forward-looking cost, making the narrative arc exceptionally tight and satisfying for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active agent in the story. The canyon's acoustics, temperature, and geology are all indispensable to the plot: the cold enables the frost-reading, the echoing hoofbeats provide tension, and the rock formations offer both shelter and a path for escape. This integration of environment into choice and action is exemplary, with the canyon walls' "residual warmth" providing a final, resonant image that charges the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear dominant stake—survival—and masterfully deepens it into a stake of justice once the ledger is deciphered. The pressure escalates perfectly under a causal lens, moving from the quiet threat of the past to the immediate, active threat of the hunters. Yara's agency drives every key turn, and the final escape feels earned, with the cost—continued danger and "uncertain justice"—legibly carried forward into the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of creation, destruction, and reclamation is beautifully woven through recurring motifs of glass, fire, and cold. The central image of the "scorched testament" is powerful and resonant. The story's primary flaw lies in the final third, where it succumbs to thematic echo by explicitly stating its core insight ("creation and survival shared the same rhythm"). This brief moment of telling slightly undermines the otherwise powerful, image-driven conclusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through the unique perceptual signature of a glass artist, using metaphors of heat, cold, and material transformation to describe thoughts and emotions. The psychic distance is expertly controlled, modulating between quiet reflection and the heightened sensory focus of the escape. The prose has a confident, rhythmic control that enhances the atmosphere without ever obscuring the narrative's propulsive clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is polished and evocative, demonstrating high information density and syntactic variety. The figurative language is often striking and purposeful, particularly when linking Yara's craft to her experience. However, a few moments verge on being overwritten, with a density of metaphor that slightly slows the momentum, and the final line ("glass, once cooled, never doubts the shape it has chosen") feels like a well-worn aphorism that lessens the impact of the preceding, stronger images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story's core conceit—using morning frost to reveal the "negative" of a scorched text—is exceptionally original and brilliantly executed. It transforms a standard hunted-protagonist trope into something memorable and specific. The synthesis of the character's profession with the central plot mechanic feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable, representing a high degree of ingenuity and conceptual integrity.</comment>
