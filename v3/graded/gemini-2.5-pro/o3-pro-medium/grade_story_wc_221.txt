<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Characterization is superb, with a clear and compelling motivation rooted in grief and duty. The protagonist's internal conflict between confusion and exploration is dramatized effectively through her actions, culminating in an earned character change. The voice's interiority feels both specific and authentic, particularly in the moment she laughs at the tear smearing her sketch, linking her "blessed pariah" status to the purpose of comets.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through atmosphere and symbolic action. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where confusion thaws into exploration, lands with palpable cost in the final image of her walking alone. The external events (shield retraction, intercom) act as effective catalysts that force a crystallization of her stance, a sophisticated use of coincidence that serves the story's mode perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in atmospheric and functional detail, acting as both a constraint and a character. The "echoed silence" and the latent power of the shutdown station create a potent, tangible atmosphere from the first line. Key objects—the viewport, the applique, even the micro-draft—are not mere descriptions but are integral to the protagonist's choices and the story's final, resonant image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The central stake—maintaining connection and purpose against overwhelming isolation—is clear and deeply felt. The conflict deepens effectively, escalating from a private ritual to a public declaration when the intercom crackles to life. The protagonist demonstrates powerful agency in her choice to respond with her "map," a decision that carries the clear cost of embracing an uncertain future alone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Thematic depth is exceptional, with concepts of guidance, time, and purpose emerging organically from the narrative's central images and actions. The final image provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's core questions. A minor deduction is for the line "the purpose of the drawing was to turn confusion into exploration," an explicit statement in a story that otherwise brilliantly shows its theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and impeccably controlled, establishing a powerful and consistent tone. The prose has a unique perceptual signature, focusing on subtleties of light, sound, and silence that reflect the character's isolated state. The two brief lines of dialogue are deployed with maximum impact, creating a pivotal moment of tension and release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with a varied sentence rhythm that matches the emotional beats of the scene. Figurative language is strong and evocative, particularly descriptions like time feeling like "molten sugar pulled into clear threads." The piece is free of scaffolding or redundancy, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft and precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>This story takes familiar science fiction tropes—isolation, grief, communication across vast distances—and transforms them into something fresh and deeply poignant. The synthesis of the "temporally stretched" father, the family sketching ritual, and the metaphorical use of "true north" is both original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The quiet, internal resolution is a confident and artistically successful risk.</comment>
