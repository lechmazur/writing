<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is exceptionally clear and her defining trait, "emotionally rational," is successfully dramatized in the climax. The caretaker's turn is grounded and credible. However, the dialogue in the confrontation scene feels overly stylized and aphoristic for both characters, momentarily sacrificing authentic voice for thematic declaration, as when Mira states, "beauty divorced from honesty was only gilded rot."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Causal drive. The plot progresses with airtight logic from clue to discovery to confrontation, all within a tight, continuous scene. The closure is a superb example of Charged Poise: the sirens signal an immediate, costly consequence while the final image of the blackbird confirms a resonant, decisive change in the status of the truth, fulfilling the rubric with an on-page cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is both atmospheric and mechanically essential to the plot. Details are vivid and purposeful, moving beyond mere backdrop to become a key constraint. The mural isn't just decoration; it’s a lock that Mira must pick using the story's core logic, directly shaping a pivotal action and charging the final image as she touches it again, satisfying the 9+ test for this category.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing truth—is established immediately and tested under pressure. The arrival of the caretaker provides a single, potent escalation that shifts the conflict from physical to moral. Mira's agency drives the resolution, and the audible sirens at the end establish a clear, immediate cost for her success, making the stakes and their consequences satisfyingly concrete.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus "noble lies" is powerfully integrated into the plot and imagery, particularly the mural parallel. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Lines like "a closed narrative was precisely why mold flourished on the walls of history" and the final paragraph's summary ("the best histories are written not in ink but in reopened airways") function as authorial moralizing, weakening an otherwise resonant ending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, literary, and consistent from Mira's point of view. The prose has a strong perceptual signature. The primary weakness is voice convergence in the dialogue; the caretaker's speech ("beautifully unspoken, a necessary noble lie") mirrors Mira's elevated, academic register, making their exchange feel more like a staged debate than a spontaneous confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("flashlight slicing through dust like a censor's pen"). The momentum is excellent, and there are no technical errors. The score is held back slightly by a tendency towards high-register abstractions and constructed aphorisms that, while fitting the tone, occasionally feel overwrought and slow the otherwise crisp pacing of the discovery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>While the "historian deciphers a secret" premise is familiar, the story distinguishes itself through its specific, grounded context—a denied labor strike—and its ingenious central mechanism of drawing allegorical parallels. The contemporary twist of the caretaker using a camera phone is a fresh, intelligent update to the trope. The synthesis of elements feels cohesive and purposeful, creating a memorable and distinct narrative.</comment>
