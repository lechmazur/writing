<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The android's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in its dual function of caretaking and remembering. Its internal conflict—the "static"—is well embodied and provides a strong personal stake. The final choice is earned, but the concluding self-analytical summary, "Fragmented wholeness, I recorded, is enough...," feels slightly too diagnostic, stepping back from the embodied experience of the prior paragraph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless causal structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative to Causal) lens. The arrival of the external threat (storm) forces a confrontation with the internal one (fears), leading to a single, decisive tightening. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "wholeness," is earned on the page with a clear felt cost—the acceptance of permanent fragmentation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is superb, functioning as a primary constraint and resource that shapes the entire plot. The glass dome is not merely a location but a fragile boundary that necessitates the "controlled burn" solution. Details like the rose-waste ethanol are perfectly integrated, making the environment an active participant in its own salvation and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The stakes are established immediately and escalate with precision when the android realizes the storm will weaponize the children's fears. This turn is protagonist-driven, emerging from knowledge gained in-scene, and it dramatically narrows the available options. The resolution is achieved through the android's direct agency, with a cost that is both physical (the burn) and philosophical (accepting imperfection).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of containing chaos rather than fighting it is masterfully woven through action and imagery, culminating in the final resonant state. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the explicit statement "Fragmented wholeness, I recorded, is enough..." This moment of thematic summary, while concise, is less powerful than the preceding images and actions that demonstrate the same idea.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, consistent, and beautifully controlled, blending mechanical precision ("prime loop," "subroutines") with a poetic, melancholic sensibility ("servo grace," "heartbeat moss"). The narrative distance is expertly managed, maintaining a specific perceptual signature that makes the android's interiority feel both alien and deeply relatable. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the rising tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and efficient, with high information density and evocative imagery ("serpent respecting my measured geometry"). There are no significant artifacts or loops. A few phrases, like the repeated "thereby" in the protocol description, are slightly mechanical, but this is a minor blemish in an otherwise polished and propulsive piece of writing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>This story achieves a high degree of originality by synthesizing familiar sci-fi concepts—the lone caretaker android, post-apocalyptic survival—into a unique and emotionally specific narrative. The central conceit of an android guarding a literal "box of childhood fears" and using a "controlled burn escape" to manage both internal and external chaos is an ingenious and memorable synthesis.</comment>
