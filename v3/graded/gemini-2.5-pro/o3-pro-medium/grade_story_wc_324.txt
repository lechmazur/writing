<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clear, consistent, and active. Her defining trait, being “persistently curious more than she was fearful,” is not just stated but dramatized as she unhooks the chain and descends the stairs. The final choice to sacrifice her lantern's power and archive the photo is a perfect culmination of her professional duty and personal empathy, earning the story's emotional closure with a tangible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The plot unfolds as a steady accumulation of sensory clues, building from a whisper to a crescendo of pulses, with each discovery logically leading to the next. The closure is a superb Conceptual Repricing and Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the nature of the "call" and the atrium's silence with a clear, felt cost on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is the story's triumph, functioning as both atmosphere and antagonist. Details like "ivy threading iron ribs like green veins" are vivid and purposeful, while key environmental features—the chained door, the fountain, the flagstone—are not just scenery but essential, interactive components of the plot. The hearing aid also functions as a "micro-setting," its physical limits constraining Mira's perception and shaping her choices, which charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The stake—protecting vulnerable voices—is signaled early and remains the dominant pressure. The conflict escalates beautifully through sensory intensification, moving from faint static to an intimate giggle, which raises the personal stakes. The resolution is earned directly through Mira’s agency, and the cost—her lantern’s power—is a concrete, physical trade-off that makes her final success resonant and meaningful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of remembrance and the importance of being heard emerges powerfully from the story's imagery and actions. However, the explicit reflection, "Incidental heroism, she reflected, was simply acting when coincidence named you the only one who heard," borders on a thematic statement. While framed as interiority, it slightly over-articulates the core idea, preventing the theme from remaining purely subtextual and thus holding it back from the highest echelon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly sustained, creating a tone that is both melancholic and investigative. The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, filtering every sensory detail through Mira’s unique perception and professional focus. The prose has a distinct rhythmic quality that modulates with the rising tension, demonstrating a masterful command of narrative distance and psychic texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is largely elegant and precise, but it is marred by a significant flaw early on. The line, "The aid... could detect murmurs others missed, by tracking faint pulses in a decades-old hearing aid," is a clear and distracting paraphrase loop, restating the same information in adjacent clauses. While the rest of the piece is very strong, this unforced error in a critical setup paragraph prevents a higher score for an otherwise polished work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The core premise of a "contact tracer for hearts" is exceptionally original, blending speculative technology with a poignant, ghostly sensibility. The synthesis of bioacoustics, forgotten history, and a character defined by listening creates a memorable and unique narrative world. The story fully commits to its inventive concept, resulting in a resolution that feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable.</comment>
