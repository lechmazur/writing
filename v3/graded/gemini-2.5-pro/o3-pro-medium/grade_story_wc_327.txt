<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ioreth’s motivation is exceptionally clear and his unique abilities are fully integrated into his actions. His interiority is conveyed through a strong, specific perceptual filter (experiencing the world as texture and sound). The final choice is well-earned, but the characterization is held just shy of a 9+ score by the absence of a potent, dramatized internal conflict; his competence is so complete that it slightly mutes the sense of struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, where patterns and sensory details build pressure toward the climax. The closure is a perfect Resonant Reconfiguration: the language is not defeated but transformed and preserved in a new medium. The cost is explicit and felt on the page—the diamond cracks and the passage seals, making the moment of preservation unique and unrepeatable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but the story's central mechanism and antagonist. The "canyon of endless echoes" and "towers of bone" create a powerful, coherent atmosphere that directly shapes the plot. The flawed diamond functions as a perfect micro-setting/tool, its physical properties constraining and enabling the climactic choice, fully satisfying the 9+ gate for this category.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving a dying language—is signaled immediately and powerfully deepened by the on-page discovery that it is "dying in real time," creating genuine urgency. The conflict escalates through sensory density rather than direct opposition, fitting the textural lens perfectly. The protagonist’s agency at the climax is absolute, and the cost of success is clear and permanent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the story's unique premise, exploring memory, translation, and preservation with nuance. The final image of "newborn phonemes" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. The score is slightly tempered by the line "curse and cure share almost the same letters: both are leashes on possibility," which verges on an explicit thematic statement, momentarily thinning the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice is masterful: lyrical, precise, and wholly unique to the character's sensory experience. The point of view is maintained with unwavering control, establishing a distinct perceptual signature where sound, texture, and memory are inseparable. The prose rhythm and sophisticated diction serve the story's high concept without ever feeling overwrought or obscuring clarity, even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose is dense, evocative, and exceptionally clean, with high information content in every line. Figurative language is constant but purposeful, building the story's textural world rather than merely decorating it. The piece avoids all common prose artifacts like loops or scaffolding, and the sentence structure varies to control momentum, particularly in the climactic sequence which remains both lyrical and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story demonstrates extraordinary originality, synthesizing concepts from acoustics, linguistics, and geology into a fresh and memorable fantasy premise. It transforms familiar tropes (the wise specialist, the cursed object) through its unique sensory logic. The core idea of translating texture into sound and recording it as shadow is brilliantly conceived and executed, feeling both strange and inevitable.</comment>
