<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation and voice are exceptionally strong and specific. Interiority is vividly embodied, and the final choice is earned with a clear cost. The score is slightly tempered by a single moment of over-articulation ("That is how survivors answer...") which borders on diagnostic summary rather than maintaining pure, in-the-moment experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>This story exemplifies a perfectly executed Accumulative/Textural drive. The plot advances through shifts in perception and understanding, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The closure lands with undeniable, on-page cost when the protagonist revisits trauma to alter the formula, making the resolution both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The setting is flawless and acts as the story's central engine. The ultraviolet forest is not mere backdrop but the source of data, the primary constraint (sanctuary from drones), and the medium for the climax. The pewter mask strap functions as a perfect micro-setting, constraining choice by focusing action and charging the final image with meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story masterfully dramatizes a high-concept internal conflict. The dominant stake—to find the mathematics of mercy—is tested by a powerful deepening of despair when the initial formula fails ("one divided by zero"). The climax is driven by protagonist agency, with a resolution that is earned through a specific, costly choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Thematic resonance is exceptional, emerging organically from the central metaphor without a single didactic misstep. The story poses a profound question and answers it not with a moral, but with a transformation represented by a change in a formula. The final image of the "unfinished" proof offers a complex, resonant, and non-literal thematic closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The voice is the story's signature achievement: singular, consistent, and unforgettable. The blend of poetic, visceral language with the precise lexicon of mathematics creates a unique and compelling perceptual signature. Point of view and psychic distance are controlled with absolute mastery, making the prose inseparable from the character's mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The prose is of the highest caliber—luminous, dense, and rhythmically controlled. Every sentence carries weight, advancing character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffold; the line-level craft is propulsive and immaculate from the opening sentence to the resonant final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story is a tour de force of originality, synthesizing speculative science, trauma theory, and mathematics into a seamless and startlingly fresh narrative. It takes a significant conceptual risk by centering on an abstract philosophical quest, but the execution is so specific and grounded that the premise feels wholly earned and inevitable.</comment>
