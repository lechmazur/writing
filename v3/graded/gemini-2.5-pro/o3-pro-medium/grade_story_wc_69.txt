<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara is a compelling archetype, and her motivation is crystal clear. However, her interiority remains largely opaque; she is a catalyst whose internal conflicts or doubts are not dramatized. The story prioritizes her function over her psychology, which works for the fable-like tone but keeps the characterization from achieving the highest level of complexity. The choir members function as a collective, which is efficient but limits individual emotional arcs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds through layered action and imagery toward a powerful cadence shift at the climax. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, where the city's state is altered and Mara's departure provides a clear, felt cost. The causal logic of "subtracting noise" is thematically sound and consistently applied, making the resolution feel earned rather than magical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a standout success, functioning as a character in its own right. The "velvet library" is rendered with precise, evocative sensory detail, and its specific features—particularly the "queer acoustics" of the map alcove—are integral to the plot. The central object, the rosette, acts as a micro-setting that constrains every choice in the rehearsal, and the final image of the library denoting a vow charges the ending with immense power. The environment is inseparable from the story's success.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether harmony can overcome civic discord—is established early and tested under escalating pressure. The conflict progresses from the internal resistance of the choir to the external threat of the city council. The climax provides a decisive, high-stakes test of the choir's newly learned skill. The resolution is achieved through the protagonist's agency, and the cost is legible in her departure, which feels true to her established transient nature.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of achieving harmony through subtraction and listening is developed with exceptional grace and coherence. It emerges organically from the central metaphor of the rosette and the choir's actions, rather than from overt statements. The final image of the invisible chord offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding a simplistic moral and leaving a lingering sense of complex, fragile peace. The story’s conceptual core is its greatest strength.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyrical, consistent, and possesses a distinct, fable-like rhythm that is perfectly suited to the material. The third-person POV is controlled, maintaining a consistent distance that enhances the mythic quality. While there is little dialogue, Mara's spoken lines are perfectly in-character and carry the weight of her purpose. The prose creates a powerful and sustained mood from the first sentence to the last.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and frequently stunning, with high information density and rhythmic control. Lines like "The pause grew round and resonant, like the hollow of a long-absent instrument" demonstrate masterful craft. A minor deduction is for a slight tendency to explain its own effects, as in "The sound did not persuade by argument; it clarified...", which momentarily shifts from showing to telling. This is a small friction in an otherwise polished and beautiful piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>While the theme of art healing division is familiar, the story's execution is highly original. The central conceit of using a silent soundhole rosette and the method of "subtracting noise" provides a fresh, non-obvious angle on the trope. This specific, unexpected mechanism transforms the entire narrative, making the story feel unique and memorable. The synthesis of acoustics, music, and civic strife feels both inventive and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
