<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is exceptional, driven by the compelling internal contradiction between her inherited cunning and her personal quest for "a fair trade." Her core motivation is tested under pressure, and her decisive actions are a direct, earned result of her history and internal state. The embodiment of her stress ("pulse scrawled proofs against her ribs") is concrete and avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story operates on a flawless Causal drive. Every setup, particularly the ink pot with its loosened glass sliver, pays off with satisfying inevitability. The closure is a powerful combination of a Decisive Change (the escape) and a Conceptual Repricing (the re-evaluation of "fair trade"), with the cost of Corvus's life made explicit on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant in the plot. The funeral home provides the tools, constraints, and atmosphere that make Mara's solution possible. The vintage ink pot functions as a perfect micro-setting, constraining the central choice and charging the final image with resonant meaning, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement with ease.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stakes are immediate, personal, and ethical, signaled clearly upon Corvus's arrival. The conflict escalates beautifully through Mara's agency—her "active waiting" is a choice that directly provokes Corvus's fatal error. The resolution is earned, and the cost is calculated with chilling precision in the final lines, making the stakes and their consequences unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of "fair trade" is masterfully woven through character, object, and plot, culminating in a complex, non-moralizing resolution. The final image of the ink pot is superb. However, the line "the world, she realized, was a problem set that only liquefied rigid thinking could solve" is an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the resonance of the closing images by over-explaining them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is executed with masterful control, establishing a distinct perceptual signature through phrases like "twitching like an unreleased theorem." The voice is confident and literary, and the psychic distance modulates effectively with the rising tension. There are no slips in focalization or consistency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is dense, evocative, and demonstrates superb rhythmic control. Figurative language is strong and purposeful, creating a unique texture. The piece is marred only slightly by the final paragraph's tendency to state its theme directly, a minor lapse into telling that momentarily breaks the spell of an otherwise immaculately shown story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story's ingenuity lies in its seamless synthesis of disparate elements: a noir-ish thriller, a philosophical inquiry into justice, and a character study of inherited legacies. The central conceit of the mortician using her father's con-artist ethos to outwit a corrupt agent is highly original. The resolution feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable.</comment>
