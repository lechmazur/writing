<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear, but her interiority feels overly articulate and diagnostic, stating the story's themes rather than embodying a contradictory struggle. Emotions are described with poetic labels ("unyielding compassion like a lantern") instead of being dramatized through conflicting impulses in the scene. The change feels predetermined rather than earned through a difficult, on-page choice with ambiguous costs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through symbolic action and imagery. The structure is a single, coherent scene culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, where the meaning of Mira's lineage is transformed. The closure lands on the page with a felt cost—the lifting of long-held grief—making the final earned peace legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional and acts as a character. The "obsidian lagoon" and "black sand" harvested from a volcanic beach are not mere backdrops; they are integral to the plot, directly constraining the central ritual of the "graft." The sand's "memory of fire" perfectly mirrors Mira's internal state and charges the final image, making the environment indispensable to the story's success.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story establishes a strong internal stake: transforming an inherited legacy of pain into a source of healing. The pressure builds effectively under an accumulative lens, culminating in the "coin's song," which serves as the decisive deepening of her resolve. The arrival of the villagers confirms the resolution of the external stakes, but the conflict lacks a moment of genuine doubt or a significant tactical trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of healing scars is powerful but executed with a heavy hand, severely undermining subtext. The story repeatedly states its own moral in declarative sentences, such as "confirming that scars can indeed sing." The final paragraphs devolve into thematic summary, explicitly telling the reader the meaning of the events, which violates the "show, don't tell" principle at the most crucial moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a lyrical, elevated tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The narrative distance is stable and the perceptual signature is clear, focused on sensory details relevant to Mira's purpose. However, the prose rhythm is somewhat monotonous, and the voice can feel more like a disembodied narrator of a myth than the internal experience of a specific character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prose is lush but suffers from overwriting; nearly every sentence is laden with figurative language, which dulls the impact and slows momentum. There are several instances of paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate the same concept with slightly different wording. While often beautiful line-by-line, the cumulative effect is a lack of concision and rhythmic variety, especially in the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core premise—a firefighter daughter of an arsonist performing a healing ritual—is fresh and compelling. The synthesis of firefighting, volcanism, and symbolic healing is ingenious. However, the execution smooths over potential complexities, resulting in a resolution that feels somewhat sentimental and preordained, slightly diminishing the concept's raw power and originality.</comment>
