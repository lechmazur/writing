<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lia's motivation is clear and escalates believably from professional curiosity to a personal sense of duty. Her core actions, like fabricating the tribute, align perfectly with her role and intellect. The transition from "abstract curiosity" to "a lifeline to those lost voices" feels slightly declared rather than fully embodied in the moment, preventing a top-tier score, but her competence and purpose are otherwise well-drawn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story follows a flawless Causal lens, with each discovery logically compelling the next action in a tight, propulsive sequence. The final Conceptual Repricing—where absence becomes presence—is a powerful and earned closure that lands with the conceptual cost of a new, permanent responsibility for the archivist. The structure is elegant and perfectly scaled for the story's length, meeting the 9+ standard with a clear cost and persistent lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is both atmospheric and functional, moving from the macro "vaulted archives" to the micro "wall of obsolete emojis." The archive is not merely a backdrop but an active participant, its algorithms and hidden sublayers dictating the plot's course. The final image of the archive pulsing with "living echoes" is charged directly by the setting's transformation, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The stake—solving a cold case—is immediately clear and deepens into a profound question about digital existence. The conflict escalates through Lia's direct agency when her fabricated post proves the system is hiding something, a perfect turn under the Causal lens. The resolution carries the undeniable cost of transforming her professional duty, making the stakes feel permanently reweighted and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of memory versus deletion, absence versus presence, is explored with nuance and precision. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the final resonant image and the crew's message—"We are still here"—to answer the central question non-literally. The concept of a digital afterlife is grounded in specific, concrete details, making the thematic payoff deeply felt and intellectually satisfying.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a voice that is both professional and lyrical. Lia's perceptual signature, her "brightly attentive" nature, shapes what the reader notices. The prose has a distinct rhythm and texture that supports the story's contemplative yet investigative tone without any slips or unmotivated shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is clean, evocative, and generally demonstrates high information density. Lines like "the hum of forgotten data like a distant choir" are excellent. However, a few moments lean toward summary, such as stating "Lia felt a surge of purpose" rather than showing it through action or perception. This slight tendency to narrate internal shifts prevents a higher score, but the line-level craft remains very strong overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>While the "ghost in the machine" is a familiar trope, its execution here—using social media metadata as a carrier for a checksum key that unlocks a digital afterlife—feels fresh and specific. The story's pivot from a rescue mystery to a meditation on memory gives it a unique poignancy. The synthesis of corporate digital archaeology and a space-faring cold case is ingenious and coherent.</comment>
