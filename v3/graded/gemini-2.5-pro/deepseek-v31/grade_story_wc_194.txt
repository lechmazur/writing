<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lysander's motivation is clear and his actions are consistent with his established traits as a quiet, deliberate "listener." The final earned stasis, where he stands silently with his new burden, is a powerful and credible character moment. Minor deductions for introductory sentences that state his role and motivation ("dynasty ender," "motivation was simple yet profound") rather than letting them emerge purely from action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly within a single, continuous scene. The structure builds pressure through ritualistic action toward a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The closure lands with a powerful, felt cost—the truth binding him to the house—making the before/after state perfectly legible and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is more than a backdrop; it is an active participant in the plot, with its "non-parallel walls" being essential for the story's central mechanism. The gramophone serves as a potent micro-setting, constraining all choices and charging the final image with its presence. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and create a thick, resonant atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear dominant stake—uncovering a hidden truth—and escalates pressure effectively under an accumulative lens. The tension builds from the hiss of the record to the emergent voice, a deepening of knowledge that irrevocably changes the protagonist's world. The cost is made unmistakable in the final paragraph, where the truth becomes a permanent, binding weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Themes of generational guilt and the burdensome nature of truth emerge organically from the story’s central conceit. The piece avoids moralizing, instead offering a potent final image—Lysander standing in the gloom, musing on the "architecture of regret." This provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, reweighting the entire narrative without a single declarative statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The point of view is stable and the voice is distinct, with a formal, melancholic texture that suits the character and tone. The prose has a clear perceptual signature focused on sound and silence. A minor deduction for the paragraph explaining "standing waves," where the voice momentarily shifts from Lysander's internal experience to a more detached, authorial explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and generally well-controlled, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, there are minor instances of telling over showing ("His motivation was simple yet profound") and thematic summary ("The truth was not a weapon; it was a pathology"). The block of technical explanation, while necessary, briefly slows the narrative momentum, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The central premise of using a gramophone to play a room's acoustic "memory" via standing waves is highly original and thoughtfully executed. It transforms a familiar gothic haunting trope into a unique, pseudo-scientific ritual. The story fully commits to this inventive concept, resulting in a memorable and distinctive narrative that feels both strange and inevitable.</comment>
