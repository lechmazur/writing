<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aris’s motivation is clear, consistent, and provides the story’s central irony when her drive to preserve is flipped to a need to contain. Her actions are logically driven by her established traits as a "sharp-eyed dusk noticer." The final transformation is a powerful choice, but its description—"forging her hope into a shield, her regret into a weapon"—borders on abstract summary rather than an embodied, in-scene process, slightly softening an otherwise strong character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story follows a flawless causal chain: an anomaly prompts investigation, investigation reveals a threat, and the threat forces a personal transformation. The structure is tight and propulsive, with no wasted motion. The closure is a perfect example of Charged Poise, landing on a final, crystallized stance with a clearly legible and deeply personal cost, fully satisfying the requirements for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is both atmospheric and functional, with the beautiful, living library providing a stark contrast to the parasitic horror discovered within. More importantly, the "river stone" functions as an exceptional micro-setting; it is the focal point of the conflict, and understanding its true nature is the key that unlocks the entire plot. This object directly constrains Aris's final choice and charges the story's ending with menace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The stakes escalate with masterful efficiency, moving from an archival puzzle to a personal, existential threat as Aris realizes the entity has infected her. This deepening is driven entirely by her agency as an investigator. The final choice to contain the pathogen carries the unmistakable cost of her own painful transformation, making the stakes visceral and the resolution hard-earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story powerfully explores themes of memory, hope, and hidden dangers, using the central concept of a commodified dreamscape to great effect. The twist that a "cherished dream" is actually a desperate warning is thematically potent. The final image of forging regret into a weapon offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict, avoiding a simple moral while delivering a powerful emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly matched to the character and setting, establishing a tone of deliberate, scholarly grace that makes the intrusion of cosmic horror more impactful. The close third-person POV is tightly controlled, and the narrator's perceptual signature—that of a meticulous "noticer"—is consistent throughout. The prose rhythm modulates effectively from quiet observation to rising urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and concise, with high information density. However, at the most critical emotional turning points—the realization of "luminous regret" and the final "metamorphose"—the language shifts from concrete imagery to abstract conceptual summary. While articulate, this tells the reader about the change rather than fully immersing them in the sensory experience of it, slightly dulling the immediacy of the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>While the idea of shared or recorded dreams is a familiar genre element, its synthesis here with archival investigation and a slow-burn cosmic horror is highly original. The story creates a distinct mood and a memorable central threat ("a shadow unbound"). The narrative commits fully to its grim premise, resulting in a conclusion that feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable.</comment>
