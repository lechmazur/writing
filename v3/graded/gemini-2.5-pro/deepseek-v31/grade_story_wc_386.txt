<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is compelling and consistent, serving as a strong engine for the narrative. However, her interiority reads more as a statement of purpose than a dramatized internal conflict; contradictory impulses are described rather than shown in action. The story effectively portrays her competence, but a moment of genuine struggle or a difficult micro-choice would have elevated the characterization from a skilled operator to a more deeply felt protagonist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story's structure is flawless for its length, operating under a Hybrid (Accumulative to Causal) lens. It establishes the premise, accumulates pressure by describing the chaotic psychic noise, and delivers a clean, causal climax and a resonant Conceptual Repricing for its closure. The final realization lands with the undeniable cost of a "terrible fact," perfectly reweighting the story's initial mystery into a moment of grim clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, a primary strength of the piece. The "candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice" is not only vividly imagined but also thematically integral, embodying the story's ideas of preserved memory and cold truth. The central object, the melted snow globe, functions as a powerful micro-setting that directly constrains the final choice (the act of understanding) and charges the final, reverent image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear dominant stake—exposing a lie—and achieves a meaningful tightening when Elara isolates the purser's consciousness from the chorus of spirits. However, the conflict unfolds as a successful, low-friction procedure. The pressure is intellectual and psychic but lacks a moment of visceral opposition, doubt, or a trade-off that would have made the final victory feel more hard-won and costly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme is handled with impressive subtlety and power. The central question of salvaging truth from wreckage emerges organically from the plot and coalesces in the potent symbol of the snow globe—a memory of innocence used as an instrument of destruction. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer, avoiding any moralizing in favor of a quiet, profound tableau that lingers effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, creating a tone of solemn expertise and ancient mystery that perfectly suits the concept. The third-person limited POV is controlled with no leaks, and the psychic distance is expertly managed, drawing close for the final revelation. The prose has a distinct rhythm and perceptual signature, making Elara's worldview feel unique and authoritative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and concise, with high information density and strong, evocative word choices. The rhythm is well-paced, building a quiet, reverent momentum. A single sentence—"And she weaves truth carefully, for a misplaced assumption could..."—reads as a slight authorial intrusion that tells the reader the stakes of her work rather than letting the scene show it, a minor blemish on otherwise polished craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable ingenuity by synthesizing familiar tropes into a fresh and memorable whole. The core concept of a "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" who works via dream-cameos in a glacial shrine is highly original. This unique framework transforms a relatively standard mystery plot (insurance fraud) into something that feels entirely new and specific, showcasing a confident and authentic vision.</comment>
