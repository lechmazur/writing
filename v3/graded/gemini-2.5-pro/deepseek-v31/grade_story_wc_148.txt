<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is exceptionally clear and tied to a compelling lineage. The final choice to speak truth is earned and directly confronts his "inherited sin." However, interiority occasionally veers into thematic summary rather than embodied experience, as in the line "He was not weaving a new tale; he was untangling an old, knotted one," which labels the process instead of letting the preceding action carry the full weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The structure is flawless for this length, operating on a Hybrid (Accumulative-to-Causal) lens. The setup (seeking the lattice) leads directly to a causal climax, and the closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The final sentence, "its last bodies yet to be found," adds a layer of Charged Poise, demonstrating a masterful control of narrative resolution and lingering tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is both atmospheric and functional, with "copperlight repose" acting as a perfect tonal frame. Crucially, the micro-setting of the confessional and the object-as-setting (the lattice) are not decorative; the lattice directly constrains the central choice and becomes the mechanism of resolution. The sensory detail of the "low hum" resonating through stone effectively physicalizes the supernatural threat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story establishes a powerful dominant stake: Kaelen's internal quest for truth, given immense urgency by the external threat of the bodies. The appearance of the Warden of Echoes serves as a perfect, meaningful escalation that tests the protagonist's core motivation. The resolution is driven by Kaelen's agency, and the cost—the vulnerability of speaking a terrible truth—is palpable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of inherited lies versus earned truth is woven into every element, from character lineage to the function of the central object. The story’s masterstroke is turning the confessional lattice, an object of hidden speech, into a filter for purifying truth. The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem, achieving profound thematic depth without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident, distinct, and sustained, carrying a mythic, slightly formal tone that perfectly suits the fable-like premise. The point of view remains tightly controlled, and the narrative's perceptual signature—its focus on silence, history, and stone—is consistent and character-specific. The prose rhythmically modulates to match the rising tension and quiet resolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. There is, however, a slight tendency toward abstraction in key moments, particularly the opening sentence ("a necessity that sustained impossibilities"), which is dense and less immediate than the rest of the piece. While this doesn't derail the narrative, it slightly dulls the initial impact before the story finds its concrete footing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story synthesizes a familiar fable ("The Boy Who Cried Wolf") with supernatural horror and a quiet literary resolution in a highly original way. The concept of the Warden of Echoes as an entity formed from stifled pleas is fresh and thematically potent. The central mechanic—using the lattice to filter truth rather than whisper lies or sins—is an ingenious and memorable transformation of a known object.</comment>
