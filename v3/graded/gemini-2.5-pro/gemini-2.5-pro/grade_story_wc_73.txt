<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The character's esoteric motivation is established with conviction and clarity, avoiding abstraction through concrete action. The internal state is perfectly embodied in the final paragraph, where the "fresh wound in his soul" coexists with a "profound sense of triumph," demonstrating a complex, earned emotional state. The final shift in perspective, seeing the prison as a canvas, is a powerful and earned change rooted in the story's events.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Conceptual Repricing (CR) for its closure. The causal chain of the mathematical proof leads directly to a non-causal, textural climax, a sophisticated use of a Hybrid drive. The cost is made explicit and felt on the page through the agony of the relived moment, fulfilling the rubric's cost-proof test perfectly and anchoring the final resonant image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but the primary antagonist and the medium for the character's work, satisfying the 9+ gate condition with ease. Details are sparse but purposeful, creating a powerful atmosphere of sterile infinity. The stairs function as a canvas for the proofs and the dice as a micro-setting that constrains the central choice, making the environment an active agent in the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story builds pressure masterfully around a single, highly original stake. The escalation is purely driven by the protagonist's agency—the painstaking completion of the proof—which forces the final, catalytic action. The cost of this action is rendered with visceral, emotional weight, making the stakes feel both significant and deeply personal, despite their abstract nature.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Thematic concerns of logic, memory, and finding purpose within confinement emerge organically from the character's struggle. The story avoids any overt moralizing, culminating in a final image—the prison as a canvas—that serves as a powerful, non-literal answer to the central conflict. This ending reweights the entire preceding narrative with resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident, consistent, and perfectly matched to the intellectual, obsessive character. Psychic distance is expertly controlled, bringing the reader close during the sensory climax while maintaining a slightly formal tone elsewhere. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, exemplified by sharp, memorable phrases like "a grim smile was the uniform of his optimism."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density without a single wasted word. Sentence structure and rhythm are varied to control momentum, especially in the transition from the methodical work to the climactic rupture. Figurative language, such as "dissecting its ghost" and "prodding a sleeping god with a compass and a ruler," is fresh and impactful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>While the "infinite" setting is a known trope, the story's core conceit—using mathematical logic to scientifically capture the texture of regret—is brilliantly original. The synthesis of disparate fields (metaphysics, probability, emotional memory) feels seamless and inevitable in hindsight. The story takes a significant conceptual risk and executes it with flawless integrity.</comment>
