<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, but her characterization lacks internal conflict. She is presented as a flawless artisan performing a sacred duty without struggle, doubt, or contradictory impulse. While her competence is well-dramatized, this unwavering serenity makes her feel more like a function of the story's concept than a complex individual, limiting the score in this category.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story executes a perfect Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from a state of quiet potential to a focused climax and resolving into a resonant final image. The closure is a clear Earned Stasis, with the cost (the soul's dissolution) made visible on the page ("The shimmering outline on the obsidian slab was gone"). The narrative cadence shifts beautifully after the climax, fulfilling the lens requirements with precision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an integral, active component of the plot. The aurora serves as the raw material for Elara's work, directly constraining and enabling her actions, which satisfies the 9+ gate for this category. Every descriptive detail, from the obsidian slab to the velvet-lined niches, reinforces the atmosphere and charges the final, resonant image of the collected memories.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story establishes a single, potent stake: capturing a memory before a consciousness dissolves. The conflict is an elegant, high-stakes procedural, pitting Elara's focused will against cosmic chaos. The pressure deepens effectively as she isolates the memory thread, and her climactic act of infusion is a clear exercise of agency with a visible cost (the soul's final dissipation), earning the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of preserving beauty against oblivion emerges organically from the central action, avoiding any didactic statement. The story's final image—the alcove of gems, each a "tiny, captured sun"—provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question about what endures. This resonant conclusion elevates the simple plot into a moving meditation on memory and meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story maintains a consistent, elevated, and lyrical third-person voice that is perfectly suited to its mythic tone. The point of view is stable, and the narrative distance is expertly controlled, moving closer during the intense focus of the infusion. The prose has a distinct and memorable perceptual signature, particularly in its description of sensing cosmic vibrations rather than just seeing light.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is luminous and evocative, with strong verbs and carefully chosen imagery. However, it occasionally tips into being slightly overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that can feel stacked. Phrases like "great, star-dusted oblivion" and "ghost-scent of forgotten memories" are beautiful but verge on being purple, and a minor paraphrase loop appears in the second paragraph ("Her purpose... her sacred duty"), slightly dulling the otherwise sharp execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core concept of a "beautician mortician" for consciousness is highly original, offering a fresh and poignant angle on themes of death and memory. The story commits fully to this unique premise, transforming a familiar trope into something memorable and specific. The synthesis of cosmic sci-fi and intimate, delicate artistry feels both bold and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
