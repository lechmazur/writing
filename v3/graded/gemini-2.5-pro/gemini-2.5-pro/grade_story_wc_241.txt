<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's core internal conflict—her structured, probabilistic worldview versus her father's chaotic intuition—is the story's engine. Her motivation is clear and her transformation is earned, culminating in a credible shift in perspective rather than a total personality change. The line establishing her as "only theoretically rebellious" provides the perfect psychological entry point for her undertaking this illogical quest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The structure is flawless for this length, moving from a contained inciting incident to a journey of accumulation, and landing a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the close. The ending, where Aris lights the lantern, provides a resonant on-page action that re-prices her entire understanding of risk and certainty. The cost—the loss of her intellectual bulwark—is keenly felt, making the resolution both satisfying and poignant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story uses its settings to create a powerful contrast between Aris's initial world (the "hushed, rainwashed library") and the one she must enter (the "grimy, forgotten corners of the city"). The lantern and its mica pane function as a "micro-setting," a tool that both constrains her actions and decisively charges the final, resonant image on the balcony overlooking the rail yard. The specificity is purposeful and elegantly integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake is internal—Aris's need to reconcile her life's philosophy with her father's—and it's signaled immediately. The plot deepens this stake through her journey, with each cryptic discovery representing a step away from her own certainty. The final message acts as a perfect culmination of pressure, forcing a stance crystallization that is earned by her actions and carries the clear cost of her former worldview.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of logic versus intuition, or calculated odds versus beautiful risk, is masterfully woven through character and action, emerging organically rather than being stated. The final image of the lantern light making the cipher a mere shadow is a superb, non-literal resolution. The final line about the "equation finally, beautifully, resolved" borders on being slightly too explicit but is saved by being perfectly in character for a probability professor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice is confident, consistent, and perfectly suited to the protagonist—an academic whose precision is challenged by an emotional mystery. The narrative maintains a controlled, melancholic tone that modulates effectively with the story's progression. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature; we see the world through Aris's analytical-yet-grieving eyes, which makes her eventual shift in perspective all the more powerful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. Sentences are beautifully constructed, with varied rhythms that propel the narrative forward ("a pilgrimage guided by vandals and ghosts"). There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding; every word serves the story's character, atmosphere, and momentum with remarkable efficiency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story presents a highly original synthesis of familiar elements. The core concept of a probability professor deciphering subway graffiti to understand her gambler father is fresh and thematically rich. It transforms the "posthumous treasure hunt" trope into a profound intellectual and emotional journey, avoiding clichés and delivering a conclusion that feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable.</comment>
