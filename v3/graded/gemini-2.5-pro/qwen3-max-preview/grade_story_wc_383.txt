<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "archive" rather than "heal" is compelling and consistent. Her interiority is vividly rendered, but dips into diagnostic self-awareness with lines like, "This was her alchemy: turning solitude into sovereignty..." This over-articulation slightly flattens the embodied emotion, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure within a single, continuous scene. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist becomes "sovereign," is earned, lands on the page with a clear conceptual cost ("not healed, not whole"), and provides a powerful final image. The causal logic of the internal journey is impeccable for this lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "velvet garden" is an exceptional setting, acting as an atmospheric crucible for the character's internal process. Sensory details are specific and purposeful, and the environment constrains the emotional choices. The seashell functions perfectly as a "micro-setting" object that drives the action and charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The internal stakes—archiving memory before it dissolves versus being consumed by it—are clear and potent. Pressure escalates beautifully as an internal deepening, driven by the shell's whispers, which forces the protagonist's final stance. The cost is legible in the renunciation of wholeness for sovereignty, marking a sophisticated and earned resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of achieving sovereignty through witnessing one's past is nuanced and powerful. However, the story occasionally lapses into stating its theme directly, as in "Her independence was not freedom from the past, but fluency in its language." This explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs slightly undermines the resonant power of the closing images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical, consistent, and possesses a distinct perceptual signature. The close third-person POV is expertly controlled with no psychic distance breaks. The prose texture is rich and sustained, creating a cohesive narrative stance that perfectly matches the story's tone and thematic aims, though the consistently elevated register offers little modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious and often stunning, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, the density of figurative language is relentless, occasionally bordering on overwritten and slowing momentum. A few phrases use a template cadence ("Pain became pattern. Isolation became architecture."), which, while effective, is a minor prose artifact that keeps it from the highest tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story transforms a familiar premise—confronting past trauma—with a fresh and ingenious angle: the rejection of healing in favor of "archiving" and "sovereignty." This conceptual shift, combined with the unique mechanics of "resonance structures," feels both original and emotionally authentic. The synthesis of skepticism and magic is specific and memorable.</comment>
