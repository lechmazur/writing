<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation evolves credibly from professional curiosity to a deeply personal, obsessive quest. Her internal conflict is shown through purposeful action, particularly the sequence of lies that demonstrate her increasing commitment and isolation. The final shift from "hunter" to "anchor" is an earned and resonant change, secured by the cost of perpetual secrecy and vigilance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building pressure through layered details rather than simple causal turns. The closure—a form of Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—is masterful; her new role as "anchor" lands with a palpable conceptual cost. The structure is tight, with each discovery organically leading to the next, culminating in a conclusion that is both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is the story's strongest asset, functioning not as a backdrop but as the central mechanism and antagonist. The archive as a "resonance chamber" is a brilliantly realized concept, and sensory details—the hum of servers, the screaming silence, the warmth of a drive—are perfectly selected to create a haunting, palpable atmosphere. The environment directly constrains and enables the climactic choice, passing the highest test for integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The stakes are established early and escalate from a professional mystery to a metaphysical responsibility. The protagonist's agency is absolute; every key turn results from her deliberate choices in the face of uncertainty. The deepening of the conflict, from finding data to manipulating resonance, constitutes a significant and well-executed tightening that makes the quiet, costly resolution feel entirely earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Thematic exploration of memory, deletion, and persistence in a digital age is sophisticated and deeply integrated. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing its complex ideas to emerge from concrete images and actions—the gaps between posts, the rhythm of forgotten songs. The final image of the protagonist as an "anchor" provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question that resonates long after reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is controlled with exceptional precision, establishing a voice that is at once lyrical, technical, and melancholic. The protagonist's perceptual signature—seeing the world through the lens of data, archives, and cadence—is distinct and consistently maintained. Prose rhythm and diction are masterfully controlled, modulating perfectly with the rising tension and the story's quiet, haunting tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The prose is dense, evocative, and exceptionally clean, with no evidence of scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language, such as data "unraveling into the substrate" or silence that "screamed," is fresh and integral to the story's core concepts. Sentence structure and paragraphing create a compelling rhythm that drives momentum toward the quiet, powerful climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story's core premise—that deleted people become "de-referenced" entities lingering in the digital substrate—is highly original and brilliantly executed. It synthesizes elements of ghost stories, sci-fi, and corporate thrillers into a unique and resonant whole. The quiet, ambiguous resolution subverts genre expectations in a way that feels both intellectually and emotionally satisfying.</comment>
