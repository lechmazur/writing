<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The character's motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in a specific worldview ("every ghost is a story refusing to be buried"). His actions are driven by this professional-yet-personal ethos, and his competence is well-balanced with his sensitivity. The final acceptance of his role as witness is earned, but the moment of self-analysis—"not guilt, not grief, but responsibility"—borders on diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening the embodied experience of that burden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>This story is a masterclass in the Accumulative/Textural drive. The plot unfolds not through causal chain reactions but through a deepening of observation that leads to discovery. The closure is a perfect example of a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the technician's witnessing alters the state of the ghosts and solidifies his own purpose, landing with the felt cost of the "weightless burden." The structure is elegant, focused, and flawlessly executed for its length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is the story's triumph. It is rendered with precise, evocative sensory detail ("faintly of popcorn and sawdust," "dust curled away... like fleeing children") that is filtered perfectly through the POV. More importantly, the setting directly constrains and enables action; the technician's key discoveries rely on interacting with the dust and reflected light, making the environment an active participant. The final image of the building "keeping vigil" cements the setting as a character in its own right.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The central conflict between discovery and neglect is established immediately and escalated with quiet precision. The stake deepens significantly with the discovery of the child's drawing, transforming a general investigation into a specific, personal tragedy. The resolution is earned through the technician's act of witnessing, which doesn't vanquish the ghosts but lightens their presence, and the cost—his acceptance of responsibility—is made explicit and felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The themes of memory, neglect, and the importance of witnessing are woven beautifully through imagery and action. The final image is resonant and avoids a simple moral. However, the piece slightly undermines its own subtext with an overly explicit thematic statement: "he’d found something rarer: closure, not for the dead, but for the living who’d walked away and never looked back." This line functions as a Thematic Echo that explains what the preceding scene already powerfully demonstrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is confident, consistent, and possesses a distinct lyrical and melancholic texture that perfectly suits the character and story. POV discipline is absolute, with a controlled psychic distance that modulates effectively between technical observation and empathetic reflection. The prose rhythm and perceptual signature—what this specific character notices—are unique and sustained without a single misstep.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is elegant, dense, and often stunning, with phrases like "a sigh woven into the settling of old timber." It demonstrates excellent rhythm and syntactic variety. The score is held back slightly by a few instances that feel overly written or explanatory, such as "his skillfully observant eyes" and the analytical summary of his burden. These moments momentarily break the otherwise immersive and concrete texture of the prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story presents a highly original synthesis: the ghost hunter as a quiet, methodical technician. The central mechanism of using a horologist's tool to analyze dust patterns as a form of paranormal investigation is inventive and memorable. By eschewing genre tropes in favor of a profound, atmospheric exploration of memory and neglect, the story achieves a fresh and authentic vision that feels both unique and inevitable.</comment>
