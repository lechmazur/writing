<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is established with compelling specificity, rooted in a professional empathy that avoids sentimentality. Her actions are consistent and reveal her character through choice—particularly the pivot from listening to broadcasting. While the girl is slightly archetypal, her grief is well-embodied; her silence and final whisper are more potent than extensive interiority would be at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The structure is impeccably clean for a single scene, following a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) drive lens. The story builds atmospheric pressure which culminates in a causal choice that resolves the situation. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the girl's echo finds stasis, lands on the page with a clear, felt cost: the final acceptance of her parents' permanent absence. All plot mechanics, from the summons to the hearing aid, are introduced early and pay off logically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in atmospheric economy, with sensory details that are both vivid and purposeful ("glass ceiling wept condensation," "lilies floated like surrendered hands"). The atrium functions as more than a backdrop; its liminal, decaying state is a physical manifestation of the girl's predicament. Crucially, a tool—the hearing aid—functions as a micro-setting that constrains and enables the central action, charging the final image with its dual function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The central stake—a soul stranded by grief—is signaled immediately and escalates effectively from a faint "tremor" to a "panicked flutter." The protagonist’s agency drives the resolution in a meaningful turn: her decision to broadcast a counter-pulse is a specific, high-stakes choice that directly confronts the conflict. The cost is made unmistakable in the gentle but firm delivery of the truth, foreclosing the possibility of reunion and enabling the final peace.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of love persisting beyond death is powerfully integrated, but its articulation skirts didacticism. The line "love doesn’t die—it just changes frequency" is a direct thematic statement that feels slightly less earned than the story's potent imagery. While the final paragraph’s summary of "incidental heroism" reinforces the core concept, it replaces some of the scene's resonant ambiguity with a label. The story's strength is in its images; these explicit statements slightly weaken their impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is executed with flawless control, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that balances professional detachment with deep empathy. The narrative voice has a distinct lyrical texture and rhythm that perfectly supports the story's melancholic, hushed tone. The sparse dialogue is a strength, with each line carrying significant weight and revealing character without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong verbs. However, a few phrases lean toward well-worn literary descriptions ("marble veined with forgotten histories," "voice low as falling ash"), which momentarily softens the otherwise sharp and original language. The final paragraph shifts slightly into a summary cadence, explaining the meaning of the preceding actions rather than letting them resonate on their own, a minor but noticeable flaw at this level.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise of an "emotional contact tracer" is exceptionally original, brilliantly reframing a contemporary technological concept into a conduit for profound humanism. The story synthesizes the ghost story trope with a unique speculative-fiction mechanic, resulting in a narrative that feels both fresh and timeless. The execution is so specific to this character and her method that the story is wholly transformative of its familiar elements.</comment>
