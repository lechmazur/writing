<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is exceptionally clear and potent, rooted in a specific, devastating trauma. The internal conflict between grief and scientific purpose is well-dramatized, culminating in the final beat of "bleak exhilaration" where these contradictory impulses coexist powerfully. The character’s final shift from a desperate search to a defined mission is earned by the climax, representing a credible change with the cost of his loss still painfully visible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story follows a tight, effective Causal lens. The inciting incident (solar flare) logically forces the use of alternate methods, which, combined with the character's motivation (the geode), leads directly to the discovery. The closure is a powerful Charged Poise, reconfiguring the protagonist's entire future while making the cost—the permanence of his loss—achingly clear. The plot is economical, elegant, and every beat feels necessary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is both atmospheric and functional. The observatory as a "fragile bubble" and the indifferent gas giant Helios create a potent backdrop of isolation. The true strength lies in the use of the geode as a "micro-setting" object; it's not just symbolic but is a critical tool that constrains his actions and directly charges the final, resonant image of the story. The console and sensor array are integrated seamlessly into the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding meaning in the face of annihilation—is established immediately and viscerally. The conflict deepens perfectly under a Causal lens, moving from an abstract hunt to a concrete, universe-altering discovery driven by the protagonist's specific choices. The final reconfiguration of his quest comes at the unmistakable price of his grief, a cost that is not erased but integrated into his new purpose, making the resolution feel earned and profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of potential preserved beyond loss is powerful and elegantly explored through the story's central conceit. The final image of mapping "stolen futures" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of grief. The only minor weakness is the repetition of the phrase "intangibly tangible," which verges on becoming a thematic label rather than letting the concept emerge purely from the action and imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that balances scientific observation with raw emotional turmoil. The voice has a distinct, slightly elevated and melancholic register that suits the character and tone. While the prose is generally strong, the voice occasionally leans on abstract phrasings that can feel more authorial than in-the-moment character thought, but it remains consistent throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong rhythm and sentence variety. However, there are minor but noticeable artifacts that prevent a higher score. The repetition of "intangibly tangible" is a conceptual loop that stands out. Additionally, a few phrases like "It wasn't memory; it was the potential *itself*..." act as scaffolding, explicitly telling the reader the nature of the discovery rather than allowing it to be fully conveyed through Aris's embodied reaction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story presents a highly original synthesis of hard sci-fi mechanics (perturbation theory) and a metaphysical exploration of grief. It transforms the familiar "haunted by loss" trope into something new by creating a tangible, scientific framework for where lost potential goes. The ending masterfully avoids cliché, offering not a resurrection but a new, profound purpose that feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable.</comment>
