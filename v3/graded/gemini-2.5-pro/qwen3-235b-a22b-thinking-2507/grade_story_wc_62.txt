<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation and internal conflict—the stonemason's tangible craft versus the ephemeral nature of memory—are expertly rendered and embodied. His actions are driven by a believable and specific hierarchy of values, and the final emotional release is earned through the preceding struggle. The contradiction between his instinct to "carve into stone" and the living ritual he performs is the story's powerful core.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot advances not through causal turns but through a deepening ritual that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure, where Silas re-prices the concept of grief, lands with a clear and moving felt cost (his tears), fulfilling the requirements for this lens perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse is far more than a setting; it is a central, active participant in the story's thematic and emotional arc. It constrains the action, houses the key symbols (butterflies), and ultimately becomes the final, resonant metaphor for grief itself. Every detail, from the iron bones to the skeletal rose cane, serves the story's purpose with exceptional economy and power.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The internal stake—how to give shape to collective grief—is established immediately and intelligently escalated by the mentor's intervention. The climax isn't a confrontation but a shift in practice, a choice to engage with the ritual differently, which forecloses his old method of solitary stonework. The cost is the emotional vulnerability Silas had been resisting, made visible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of memory's living nature versus the permanence of stone emerges organically from the story’s core images. The final realization provides a profound, non-literal answer to the central question without a whisper of moralizing. The image of the butterflies forming a "vessel" is a masterful thematic resolution, complex and emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical, precise, and sustained, establishing a somber yet luminous tone that perfectly suits the material. The third-person limited POV remains impeccably controlled, filtering every perception through Silas's specific grief and professional lens. Corvin's dialogue provides a distinct, complementary texture without breaking the established voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is of a very high caliber, characterized by dense, evocative imagery and strong rhythmic control. There are, however, minor flaws: the phrase "fiercely meditative" is repeated, and a few images verge on the familiar ("catching like burrs in his throat"). These are hairline imperfections in an otherwise immaculate surface, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of stonemasonry, a family poetry ritual, and monarch migration to explore grief is both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable. The story transforms the familiar "grieving protagonist" and "ghostly mentor" tropes into something specific and deeply moving. The central conceit feels entirely fresh and is executed with conceptual integrity.</comment>
