<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority occasionally lapses into overly articulated self-awareness. Phrases like "vulnerability felt like a raw nerve—and her only weapon" and the final paragraph's neat summary of her change read more like thematic statements than embodied emotion. While her core struggle is compelling, this diagnostic self-awareness slightly flattens the rawness of her crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, with each discovery propelling the next action. The setup of the cast and seashell pays off directly in the deciphering scene, leading to a Decisive Change (sending the video) with a clear felt cost. The structure is tight and satisfying for its length, with the cipher mechanism serving as an excellent engine for the central turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>While the "rusted library" setting is largely atmospheric, the "micro-setting" of the gritty, smudged cast on Maya's leg is masterfully integrated. It is not just a symbol of her injury but the literal surface for the story's central puzzle and proof. The cast constrains her physically while simultaneously holding the key to her agency, directly charging the final, climactic action of filming it as evidence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming her agency and exposing a betrayal—is established immediately and effectively escalated. The deciphering of the note provides a single, powerful deepening of the conflict, transforming a suspicion into actionable certainty and forcing a high-stakes choice. The resolution is earned entirely through the protagonist's agency, with the cost of professional risk and confronting trauma made clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of vulnerability as power is central, but its execution lacks subtlety. The story repeatedly states its theme directly, culminating in a final paragraph that reads like a moral summary ("Vulnerability wasn’t a cage; it was the key..."). This thematic over-articulation, especially at the end, replaces earned resonance with explicit explanation, undercutting the power of the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is controlled and maintains a consistent psychic distance, effectively grounding the reader in Maya's perspective. The narrative voice is distinct, though it sometimes strains for lyricism. The primary strength is its unwavering focus; there are no knowledge leaks or unmotivated shifts, ensuring the plot's unfolding feels tied to Maya's direct experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious but frequently overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that can feel strenuous ("groaned under the weight of the stars," "skeletal metal shelves clawing"). Some sentences are sharp and propulsive, but others are burdened by mixed metaphors or clichés ("snapping like rotten thread"). The final paragraphs, in particular, accumulate thematic statements and abstract nouns, losing the specificity that grounded the earlier scenes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise of an aquaphobic stunt double betrayed into a water stunt is a fresh, compelling hook. The core ingenuity lies in the specific mechanism of the child's coded message on the cast, which feels both unique and character-driven. While the broader "exposing the villain" arc is familiar, the particular details of its execution transform the trope into something memorable and specific.</comment>
