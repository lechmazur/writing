<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elara’s characterization is exceptional, with motivation that is both deeply internalized and clearly dramatized. Her shift from observer to active guardian is seamless, driven by a specific, embodied interiority ("luminescent ache settled in her chest"). The final choice to build the cairns is a perfect synthesis of her reticent nature and crystallized purpose, earned through prior beats with a visible, felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure builds atmospheric pressure that culminates in a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) for its closure. The path of relighting the lamp is foreclosed with finality ("rusted shut"), and the cost of this failure is paid on the page through the pivot to a more fragile, human-scale solution, making the ending both resonant and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in atmosphere and function, acting as both antagonist and crucible. The "haunted" quality is not a supernatural gimmick but the palpable weight of legacy, which directly pressures Elara's choices. The environment constrains the final action, with the sea glass—a recurring object—acting as the indispensable key that charges the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The stakes—the immediate safety of ships and the thematic preservation of hope—are signaled early and remain potent. The story achieves escalation not through plot turns but through a masterful deepening of texture and responsibility, consistent with its accumulative lens. Elara's agency in the face of irreversible failure drives the resolution, and the cost of her choice is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges with superb subtlety from the story's central images: the extinguished lamp, the sea glass, the stacked stones. The final image of the "lighthouse of the soul" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question about hope. A few phrases in the last third, like "quiet rebellion against despair," verge on stating the theme, a minor slip in an otherwise impeccable execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The point of view is flawlessly controlled, with a distinct and lyrical narrative voice that perfectly captures Elara's "warmly observant" yet reticent nature. The prose has a specific perceptual signature, filtering the world through her unique lens ("a sound swallowed too quickly by the void"). Psychic distance is managed with precision, modulating seamlessly with the rising emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose is luminous, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Word choice is precise and evocative, creating a rich texture without sacrificing momentum. A few instances of figurative language, such as "a soft, blue sorrow," feel slightly overwrought, momentarily pulling away from the otherwise grounded and potent style. The piece is free of technical artifacts or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>This story transforms the familiar trope of a haunted lighthouse into something deeply original and emotionally resonant. The ingenuity lies in making the haunting a legacy of duty rather than spirits, and in the quiet, analog solution of stone cairns. The synthesis of elements feels specific and inevitable, creating a memorable vision that is both timeless and unique.</comment>
