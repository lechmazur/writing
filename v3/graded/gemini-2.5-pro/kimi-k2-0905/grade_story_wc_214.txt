<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The janitor’s characterization is effective, with a clear motivation rooted in spiritual curiosity that evolves into a profound internal shift. His final choice to leave the lantern is a powerful, earned action demonstrating change with a visible cost. However, his interiority occasionally relies on high-concept abstractions like "the soft meteor of grief," which, while poetic, slightly distance the emotion from concrete embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story's structure excels under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered imagery rather than strict causality. The orientation is immediate and clear, and the progression from observation to empathic vision feels both magical and inevitable. The closure is a superb Conceptual Repricing, where the janitor's final actions provide a resonant answer to the meteor's question, with the tangible cost of abandoning the lantern making the change legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully rendered, with the "flourishing stillness" of the obsolete observatory creating a potent and essential atmosphere. Key objects, particularly the yellow lantern glass, function as a micro-setting that is not merely decorative but central to the plot's mechanism and closure. The final image of the dome left open is a perfect example of setting being used to externalize the story’s thematic resolution, easily clearing the bar for excellence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story establishes a powerful internal conflict, with the janitor's grief and loneliness as the dominant stake. Escalation is handled skillfully as a deepening of empathic connection rather than a series of external reversals, which perfectly suits the accumulative drive. The final choice to embrace vulnerability is driven by protagonist agency and comes at the clear, felt price of sacrificing a treasured object, making the resolution both costly and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of finding strength in vulnerability emerges organically from the central metaphor of burning meteors and is beautifully complex. The story’s final images provide a resonant, non-literal answer to its core questions. A significant flaw, however, is the line "understanding that strength in vulnerability was not armor but atmosphere," an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the otherwise masterful subtext by telling the reader the moral at a peak moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with exceptional control, establishing a consistent and distinctive narrative voice that is lyrical, mythic, and perfectly suited to the material. The janitor's perceptual signature—his focus on light, silence, and cosmic loneliness—is unwavering and shapes every description. The prose itself has a unique rhythm and texture that elevates the story's fable-like quality, demonstrating a high degree of stylistic command.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is elegant, with a high information density and a deliberate, hypnotic rhythm. Word choice is precise and evocative, creating a wealth of powerful images. However, the figurative language is so consistently dense—with metaphors or similes in nearly every sentence—that it verges on overwriting, slightly impeding momentum in places. While the quality of the imagery is high, a more varied textural density would have made the peak moments even more impactful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story is highly original, synthesizing science fiction, magical realism, and fable into a unique and memorable whole. The core premise of a "cosmic janitor" who listens to dying stars is fresh, and its execution avoids cliché by grounding the cosmic scale in a deeply personal emotional journey. The central metaphor of vulnerability as atmosphere is an ingenious and powerful insight that feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable.</comment>
