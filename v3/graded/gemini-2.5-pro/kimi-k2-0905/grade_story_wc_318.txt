<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is powerful and deeply embodied, particularly in the fusion of Ellery’s grief with his specific identity as a "leaf-blower symphony conductor." His motivation is crystalline and his actions are driven by a potent internal conflict between despair and a fragile hope. The only minor weakness is the articulated epiphany, which verges on a diagnostic self-awareness that slightly lessens the raw, in-the-moment authenticity of his emotional journey.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure within a single, continuous scene, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing. The closure lands with undeniable felt cost, as the nature of silence and memory is reconfigured for the protagonist and his wife. The narrative causality is emotional and symbolic rather than strictly linear, and it holds perfectly from the inciting image of the hourglass to the final, changed silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop; it is the story's central engine. The "echo-chamber tunnel" is a perfectly chosen, concrete space that physically manifests the story's themes of memory, resonance, and haunting. The specificity of the objects—the cracked pull-cord, the hourglass—is impeccable, and both constrain choice and powerfully charge the final, resonant images. This is a masterclass in making setting indispensable to plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story establishes a profound emotional stake from the first sentence and expertly deepens it. The key tightening occurs when Ellery's first attempt yields "only engine, only echo," a moment of failure that forces a tactical shift driven by renewed, desperate hope. The resolution is earned entirely through his agency, and the cost is legible in the transformation of his grief, not its erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of tending to absence emerges organically from the story's central, brilliant metaphor. However, the resonance is slightly undermined by the explicit thematic statement: "He understood then that tending to the unspoken... means giving absence a shape echoing can carry." This moment of telling, while beautifully phrased, is a "Thematic Echo" that articulates the story's thesis directly, preventing the theme from residing purely in the powerful subtext of the final images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is flawlessly controlled, maintaining a close psychic distance that immerses the reader in Ellery's specific perceptual world. The narrative voice has a distinct lyrical and melancholic texture, with a perceptual signature tied to sound that feels entirely authentic to the character. The prose rhythm and syntax modulate perfectly with the rising and falling emotional intensity of the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prose is exceptional, marked by high information density, precise word choice, and fresh, effective figurative language ("laughter—bright, sudden, the sound of a glass marble dropped onto tile"). The rhythm and propulsion are masterfully controlled, accelerating with the roar of the engine and hushing into the vacuum of silence. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every line serves character, atmosphere, and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story’s premise is strikingly original, transforming a mundane object—a leaf blower—into a conduit for a profound and magical exploration of grief. It cleverly subverts the ghost story trope into a "true haunting" of resonant love, not fear. The synthesis of the mechanical, the mundane, and the supernatural feels entirely fresh and emotionally authentic, resulting in a memorable and singular artistic vision.</comment>
