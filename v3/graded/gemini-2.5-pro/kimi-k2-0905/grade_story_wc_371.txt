<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mila’s transformation from a passive “noticer” to an active “cultivator” is earned and compelling. Her motivation is clear and consistent, and her internal shift is dramatized through action rather than summarized. The final paragraph, where the courtyard's tea steam rises inside her as a "private liturgy," provides a perfect, embodied conclusion to her character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building meaning through layered imagery and resonant action. The closure is a superb Resonant Reconfiguration: Mila's role and the city's state are reconfigured with a felt, ongoing cost (the fight never ends). The before/after is perfectly legible, moving from noticing loss to actively cultivating memory, landing with undeniable force.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in atmospheric and functional world-building. The secret tea house and overgrown palace courtyard are not just backdrops but crucibles for the story's central action and thematic core. The final image, where the "vanished bakery [is] alive inside the artwork" and Mila feels the ovens breathe, represents a perfect fusion of setting, theme, and climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The central conflict between memory and "creeping normality" is established immediately and escalated with grace. The stake—the soul of the city—is abstract but made tangible through the concrete details of vanished shops and magical bread. The move from observation to action provides a decisive deepening, and the resolution is earned entirely through the protagonist's agency, carrying the cost of perpetual vigilance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Thematic development is exceptional, emerging organically from the central metaphor of planting memory. The story avoids didacticism, allowing its core insight—"absolution is not granted but cultivated"—to land as an earned epiphany. The final image of benches where strangers share rumors provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of civic amnesia, beautifully illustrating the theme's continuity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly sustained, creating a tone of modern folklore. The point of view is flawlessly controlled, filtering the magical events through Mila's precise and unique perceptual signature as a "normality noticer." The prose itself has a distinct rhythm and texture that is instrumental to the story's success, with word choices like "heuristically" and "liturgy" feeling both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density and consistently inventive imagery ("flour ghosts," "breadcrust armor"). The prose is lush without becoming overwrought, and its rhythm propels the narrative forward. There are no wasted words or scaffold-like phrases; every sentence contributes to the story's potent atmosphere and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar tropes—magical realism, the disappearing city, the wisdom of nature—into a fresh and memorable narrative. The core concept of fighting civic amnesia with guerrilla gardening and enchanted bread is highly original. The execution feels authentic and singular, demonstrating a confident artistic vision that transforms its influences into something new.</comment>
