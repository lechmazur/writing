<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cordelia’s motivation is powerfully established and her actions are a direct, embodied extension of her character as a “newsprint heiress.” The internal conflict between honoring a legacy (the pen) and dismantling its falsehoods is dramatized with concrete choices. The change at the end is earned through a specific, costly act, fulfilling the arc from observer of regret to author of a new reality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless causal structure, where each of Cordelia's actions produces a direct, logical effect on the celestial orbit according to the rules of her "proof by contradiction." The closure unit is exceptionally strong: a Decisive Change ("The ellipse cracked open") leads to a Resonant Reconfiguration ("The story continues"), with a clear, felt cost in the splintered nib. The plot is an engine of immense precision and elegance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The observatory is far more than a setting; it is the story's central mechanism, a "solemn playroom" where abstract concepts are made tangible and interactive. Every detail, from the slit roof dripping starlight to the clockwork projector, serves the plot and deepens the atmosphere. The setting is indispensable, directly constraining and enabling the protagonist's climactic actions and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The central stake—Cordelia’s liberation from an inherited, orbiting regret—is established immediately and escalated through a series of brilliant, causally-linked turns. Her methodical writing progressively raises the pressure on the system, forcing a confrontation that culminates in a costly, agency-driven resolution. The cost of victory is made tangible and thematic in the breaking of the heirloom pen nib.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story brilliantly dramatizes its themes of truth, legacy, and the nature of regret through its central metaphor without ever resorting to overt statement. The final image of a new, wider orbit is a masterclass in resonant, non-literal resolution. A minor deduction for the newspaper headline ("Heiress Redirects Orbit of Regret"), which, while diegetic, verges on articulating the theme too directly for a piece this subtle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, seamlessly blending the vocabularies of journalism, astronomy, and formal logic into a unique and compelling prose style. The point of view is stable and close, filtering every perception through Cordelia's specific history and purpose. The dialogue, though sparse, is perfectly calibrated to the story's "solemn playful" tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prose is a high-wire act of immense skill, characterized by high metaphoric density and lyrical precision. While the style is consistently elevated, it risks tipping into being overworked; however, the figurative language is so well-integrated with the story’s core concepts that it enhances rather than obscures meaning. The rhythm and syntax vary effectively, particularly in the climax, demonstrating masterful line-level control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story's core conceit—rewriting personal history via logical proof on a celestial projector—is stunningly original. It synthesizes disparate fields into a coherent and resonant magical-realist world. The execution is audacious and confident, transforming the familiar trope of redeeming a family name into something utterly fresh, memorable, and intellectually rigorous.</comment>
