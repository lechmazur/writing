<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maris's characterization is exceptional, defined by her professional diligence as an observer, which becomes the key to navigating the story's supernatural logic. Her motivation to decode the stranger's gesture is clear and sustained. The final choice to sacrifice her own memories is a powerful, earned action that demonstrates a change from investigator to participant, showing a deep internal consistency and paying a visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story employs an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly. The structure builds pressure through a series of observed "gaps" that feel both uncanny and logical within the story's world. The closure unit—a Conceptual Repricing of the memory "loan" leading to a Decisive Change and landing in an Earned Stasis—is on-page, has a clear cost, and provides a deeply resonant resolution. The causality, while surreal, is internally consistent and compelling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in atmosphere, with the "opal dock" and "softly persistent mist" creating a liminal space that is central to the plot. The environment is not a backdrop but an active force; the mist swallows sound to heighten isolation, and the lighthouse beam becomes a tool that reveals the temporal loop. Every sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the protagonist's unique perspective, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story establishes a powerful metaphysical stake: Maris's reality and memory versus an encroaching, cyclical debt. The conflict escalates effectively through the accumulation of anomalies, moving from a physical mystery to a temporal crisis. The final choice to "repay" the debt is an act of agency with a palpable cost—the loss of personal memories—which satisfyingly resolves the central tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of memory as a debt is explored with originality and depth, emerging organically from the story's events rather than being imposed. The final image of the dock as a "closed eye" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central mystery. The story slightly over-articulates its theme in the penultimate paragraph ("every keeper stands between..."), a minor flaw that prevents a perfect score but doesn't undermine the powerfully earned conclusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is maintained with impeccable control, establishing a voice that is both lyrical and precise. The prose possesses a distinct perceptual signature tied to Maris's role as a keeper of light, noticing absences and rhythms. The narrative distance is perfectly calibrated, creating an intimate yet mythic tone that is sustained from the first sentence to the last without a single misstep.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prose is luminous and dense, with figurative language that consistently deepens atmosphere and character. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the tidal and rotational motifs of the story. While the style is highly lyrical, it remains clear and propulsive, avoiding the pitfall of overwriting for its own sake. There are no technical flaws, loops, or scaffold, resulting in a polished and immersive reading experience.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>This story achieves a high degree of originality by synthesizing familiar gothic elements—the isolated keeper, the mysterious stranger—into a unique conceptual framework of memory as a cyclical loan. The specific logic of the "gaps" and the Edelweiss as a token of "borrowed memories" feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The narrative fully commits to its strange premise, delivering a conclusion that is both surprising and deeply satisfying.</comment>
