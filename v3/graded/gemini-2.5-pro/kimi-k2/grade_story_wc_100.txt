<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation is exceptionally clear and consistent, rooted in his professional duty and a trait of being “inadvertently stubborn.” This trait is demonstrated, not just stated, through his unwavering pursuit of the mission. The internal conflict is sharpest and most effective in the single moment of hesitation before writing his own name, a micro-choice that carries the weight of the entire story's theme and provides a felt cost. The transformation to feeling "lighter" is earned by this act of acceptance and completion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive perfectly. The structure builds through a sequence of resonant, fantastical images rather than strict causality, leading to a powerful climax. The closure is a form of Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elias returns to his purpose, now re-consecrated. The cost is made tangible on the page: his bleeding fingers, the symbolic act of writing his own name in the ledger of the dead, and the consumption of the lens itself. The ending feels both inevitable and magical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is a standout achievement, both atmospheric and functional. The forgotten underwater city library is a brilliantly realized fantastical space that directly enables the story’s central action. More importantly, key objects—the broken lens and the wax-sealed book—function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. The entire environment, from the pier to the library's dome, is integral to the plot's progression and would be impossible to replace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving rest to the unburied—is established immediately and remains the focus. Under the accumulative lens, the pressure deepens thematically rather than through external opposition. The critical tightening occurs when Elias must write his own name, a choice driven by his own agency that forces a confrontation with his own mortality to complete his duty. This act ensures the resolution is earned with a clear, personal cost, making the final relighting of the beacon deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of memory, absence, and the duty of remembrance is woven beautifully through the story’s imagery. The central concept that “distress signals are not always loud” is explored with subtlety and depth. The final image of the restored lighthouse provides a perfect, resonant answer to the story's central question. The only minor weakness is Elias's final spoken line, “Some signals are meant to be answered,” which verges on summarizing the theme for the reader, slightly undermining the otherwise flawless subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and perfectly calibrated to the story's mythic, melancholic tone. The third-person limited POV remains tightly focused on Elias, and his perceptions shape the prose, creating a strong, specific filter for the fantastical events. The prose itself has a lyrical rhythm and a deliberate, almost solemn cadence that enhances the atmosphere without ever becoming opaque. The control of psychic distance is masterful, drawing the reader close during moments of decision and pulling back for resonant images.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in most lines. Phrasing like "cradled in his arms like a cracked halo" and "books floated like jellyfish" is specific and memorable. The rhythm is controlled, slowing and accelerating with the action. There are a few instances of familiar phrasing ("tide whispered secrets") that are functional but lack the sharp originality of the story's best lines, preventing a perfect score, but these are minor issues in an otherwise polished piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar elements—the steadfast undertaker, a magical object, a lost city—into something strikingly original and emotionally true. The core concept of an underwater library for the unburied, accessed via a parted sea, is a fresh and powerful central conceit. The story fully commits to its premise, following its logic to a conclusion that feels both surprising and inevitable. It avoids cliché and builds a unique, memorable world within its brief word count.</comment>
