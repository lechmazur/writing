<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear, consistent, and powerfully embodied. The internal conflict between her guilt-driven profession and her need for truth is palpable and drives the narrative. The final change feels earned, though the line "I chose silence, and I can choose voice" is slightly too diagnostic, briefly pulling back from the otherwise concrete and sensory interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, where a series of discoveries builds emotional pressure toward a Decisive Change. The associative causality feels organic and purposeful, culminating in a closure unit (the choice, the writing, the release) that lands with the deeply felt cost of accepting personal responsibility. The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the story's internal focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as a character and a constraint. The "cobalt terrace at dusk" and the "forgotten shore" are not mere backdrops but active agents in the story, revealing memories via the tide. Micro-settings like the watch hand and the tin box are handled with tactile specificity, directly constraining choice and charging the final image with immense weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The dominant internal stake—Mara’s struggle for absolution from a lifetime of chosen silence—is established immediately and escalates with each discovery. The pressure deepens not through external opposition but through an intensifying internal reckoning. The final choice to embrace her voice carries the clear, unmistakable cost of shattering her long-held justifications, making the resolution powerful and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Thematic exploration of memory, silence, and truth is sophisticated and deeply integrated. The story avoids moralizing, instead allowing the theme to emerge from the central metaphor of forging lineages versus reclaiming one's own. The final image of the paper boat carrying the truth into the "current of time" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is masterfully controlled, with a distinct and consistent narrative voice. The prose has a lyrical, melancholic texture that perfectly matches the protagonist's emotional state, creating a perceptual signature that is both beautiful and purposeful. Psychic distance modulates effectively, drawing the reader close during moments of discovery and pain.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is evocative and demonstrates high craft, with strong verbs and dense, resonant imagery. However, there are moments where the figurative language becomes slightly overwrought, such as the conceptual explanation "a hush that was not absence of sound but absence of absolution," which briefly stalls momentum. While largely excellent, a few lines could be sharpened for greater concision and impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise of a "guilt-ridden black-market genealogist" is highly original and serves as a brilliant externalization of the protagonist's internal conflict. The story transforms the familiar theme of confronting past trauma by filtering it through this unique, specific lens. The synthesis of character, profession, and setting feels fresh, inevitable, and memorable.</comment>
