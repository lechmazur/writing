<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Mara’s characterization is exceptional, with her internal conflict between her failed revolutionary past and her current role as poet-caretaker made tangible through action. The contradiction is powerfully embodied in the scene where she is found covering a mirror that reflects her younger, more certain self. Her transformation from seeing herself as a "revolutionary or traitor" to a "bridge" is earned through her choices, and her motivation feels both profound and deeply personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story employs an Accumulative/Textural lens to perfection, building pressure through imagery and thematic density rather than linear plot events. The structure delivers a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR) at its closure, transforming the central conflict from "ownership" to "stewardship" with a clear, felt cost in the form of confronted sorrow. The final image of the mirrors reflecting constellations instead of bruises provides a legible and resonant before/after state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in integration, with the "baroque asteroid" and its key features—the mirrors reflecting visible time—acting as central engines for both plot and theme. These elements are not descriptive backdrops but active constraints that shape Mara's choices, from covering the mirrors in fear to finally facing them in hope. The specificity of "bruise-colored ribbon" and "chronal dust" creates a vivid, unforgettable atmosphere that is inextricable from the story's meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—the fate of a civilization’s memory—is established early and deepens beautifully through Mara's agency. The confrontation with Dr. Solenne provides a perfect tightening point, forcing Mara to articulate and defend her purpose. The only slight weakness is the resolution of the external conflict with the Company enforcers, which feels somewhat summarized and frictionless, slightly lessening the impact of the otherwise superbly handled escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story's theme—that stories and histories are not owned but tended—emerges organically from the central conflict over the shard. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this question, reweighting the entire narrative. The final poem, while bordering on a direct thematic statement, functions effectively as a coda that crystallizes the earned wisdom of the piece without feeling like a simplistic moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The voice is luminous, consistent, and possesses a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the high-concept world through Mara's poetic and melancholic perspective. Psychic distance is masterfully controlled, bringing us close to her guilt and hope. The brief dialogue is potent and character-driven, with Solenne’s line, "gentle as falling ash," perfectly encapsulating the tone and the stakes of the conversation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is consistently beautiful and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in its imagery. However, the final act drifts into strategic telling that feels slightly less potent than the showing that precedes it, particularly in the quick resolution with the Company enforcers. The final sentence ("The miners' children learned to read the crystal's shifting stories") is a dangling fragment that feels slightly less polished than the rest of this otherwise impeccably crafted piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story demonstrates remarkable ingenuity by synthesizing disparate elements—baroque sci-fi, archaeology, and lyric poetry—into a coherent and resonant whole. The core concept of "visible time" and a history-bearing crystal is fresh and thoughtfully explored. The narrative smartly subverts the typical revolution-vs-corporation trope by resolving the conflict through creative collaboration rather than violence, a choice that feels both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
