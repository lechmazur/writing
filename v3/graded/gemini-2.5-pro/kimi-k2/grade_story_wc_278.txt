<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is singular, powerful, and utterly clear, driving every action from searching for a lullaby to the final, self-inflicted tattooing. The change is earned through a visceral, on-page choice with a permanent cost, transforming her guilt into a bearable physical mark. The characterization is realized through action and a consistent internal landscape, avoiding any diagnostic summary in favor of embodied grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless causal chain under a Hybrid (Causal-dominant) lens. The progression from letters to amber to console to tattooing is logical within the world's rules, leading to an on-page Decisive Change with a resonant, felt cost. The structure is elegant and economical, with the closure—the guilt shrinking to a freckle—perfectly resolving the initial problem.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in worldbuilding that serves plot; the "laboratory of lost sounds" is not a backdrop but the essential toolkit for the protagonist's salvation. Key objects, particularly the amber and the console, are not just described but actively constrain choices and charge the final image. The atmosphere is potent and inseparable from the character's internal state, fulfilling the 9+ criterion with ease.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—silencing an internal cry of guilt—is established immediately and tested under escalating pressure, particularly when the firmware amplifies the sound. The protagonist’s agency drives the climactic choice, which involves a significant, painful trade-off. The cost is made unmistakable and permanent on her body, providing a powerful and earned resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the synthesis of image, action, and concept, exploring the transformation of grief rather than its erasure. The story avoids any moralizing, culminating in a final image that offers a complex and resonant answer to the central problem. The idea of binding a sound to a fossil is a powerful metaphor for how we learn to carry our pasts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent psychic distance that is perfectly suited to the melancholic, focused protagonist. The prose itself has a unique perceptual signature, filtering the fantastical world through a lens of quiet sorrow and professional precision. There are no slips in POV, and the rhythm of the prose modulates effectively with the rising tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The prose is exceptionally crafted, marked by high information density, startlingly original figurative language ("original metronome of grief"), and a controlled, evocative rhythm. Sentences are concise yet rich, advancing the narrative without a single wasted word or clichéd construction. It is free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, representing a very high level of line-level mastery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story's originality lies in its seamless synthesis of disparate, evocative concepts—constellation tattoos, acoustic archaeology, haunted technology—to explore a universal human experience. It transforms the familiar trope of a haunted character into something startlingly fresh and specific. The execution is so confident that the fantastical premise feels emotionally inevitable and deeply resonant.</comment>
