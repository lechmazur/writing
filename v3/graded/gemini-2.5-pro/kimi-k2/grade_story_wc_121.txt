<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "retrace" is clear and compelling, rooted in a tangible personal history. Her internal conflict is vividly dramatized through her actions and the environment's response. The final choice to surrender the tablet is a powerful, earned change, stemming from the story's central revelation and representing a credible shift from a flawed coping mechanism to acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story employs a hybrid Causal/Accumulative lens flawlessly, moving from a clear initial goal to an emotionally resonant Decisive Change. The structure is tight, with each beat escalating pressure toward the climax. The closure, where she throws the tablet, provides a definitive 'after' state with a deeply felt cost—the abandonment of hope for a 'fixed' past—and the final image reconfigures the opening beat with new meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is a triumph of speculative fiction, both atmospheric and functional. The procedurally generated viaduct is not just a backdrop but an active force that constrains choice and reflects the protagonist's internal state. Its failure, looping on the hospital floor, is a brilliant turn, and its final dissolution provides a powerful visual for the resolution. The tablet as a 'micro-setting' is central to charging the final, decisive action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear dominant stake—to escape the labyrinth of self—and escalates the pressure with precision. The tightening occurs when the viaduct's procedural generation fails, forcing a confrontation with a core trauma instead of abstract architectural fears. This shift deepens the conflict from a conceptual struggle to a personal one, and the cost of resolution is made unmistakable in the final, grounding act of surrender.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of accepting an imperfect past to inhabit the present is developed with sublime imagery rather than exposition. The central metaphor of the labyrinth being internal is powerful, and the final image of the ripple—no longer a prophecy, but "the widening circle of now"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core problem. It resists a simple moral, landing on a complex emotional truth about healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a close psychic distance that immerses the reader in the character's surreal experience. The narrative voice is distinct, confident, and poetic, with a perceptual signature that filters the fantastical world through a lens of regret and determination. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the rising tension, creating a seamless and evocative read.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly polished, with striking and consistent figurative language that builds a coherent atmosphere. Sentences are crafted for maximum impact, driving momentum while layering meaning ("a sound like glass breaking in reverse"). While the density of metaphor is very high, it serves the story's surreal, dreamlike logic without becoming overwrought or obscuring clarity in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story achieves a high degree of originality by synthesizing science-fictional concepts like procedural generation and fractured timelines with mythological and psychological frameworks. This synthesis feels organic and inevitable rather than eclectic. The core premise is explored with conceptual integrity, leading to a conclusion that is both surprising and deeply earned, transforming familiar tropes into something memorable and specific.</comment>
