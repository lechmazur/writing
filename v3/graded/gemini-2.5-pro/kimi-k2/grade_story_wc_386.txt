<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Nadia's motivation to "salvage something pure" is beautifully externalized through her meticulous ritual, showing a professional competence that makes her grief more potent. Her interiority is concrete and specific to her unique profession. The characterization is held just shy of a 9+ score only because her internal state is one of focused execution rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously within the key scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through the methodical steps of a ritual rather than conventional causal turns. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands with profound emotional weight and a clear conceptual cost, exemplified by the now-empty snow globe reflecting a single "newly borrowed" star. The internal logic of its supernatural system is established early and holds perfectly through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in atmospheric and functional detail; it's not a backdrop but an active participant in the narrative. The glacier shrine is both a container for the ritual and a medium for its magic, with features like "auroras trapped inside ice" acting as causal agents. The snow globe serves as a perfect micro-setting, constraining the central action and charging the final image with its transformation from a vessel of disaster to one of peace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The central stake—salvaging purity from trauma—is established immediately and remains the unwavering focus. Pressure deepens decisively with the radioman's cameo, which serves as a perfect, story-specific catalyst that confirms the connection and raises the stakes for the ritual's final stage. The resolution is earned entirely through Nadia's agency, and the cost is made legible in the final lines describing sorrow that will "thaw one echo at a time."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges with exceptional grace from the story's dense web of imagery, primarily through the recurring motifs of snow, starlight, and wreckage. The transformation of the snow globe from a symbol of contained disaster to one of salvaged purity provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about grief. The final paragraph extends the theme beyond the protagonist with quiet power, avoiding any hint of a stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The voice is the story's triumph—a sustained, lyrical, and utterly distinct narrative consciousness that feels inseparable from the protagonist. Nadia's perceptual signature, filtering the world through sound, water, and memory ("listening through octaves of wreckage"), is established in the first paragraph and never wavers. POV control is absolute, maintaining a close psychic distance that makes the fantastical elements feel intimate and real.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is incredibly dense and poetic, with nearly every sentence layered with figurative language that builds a powerful, immersive atmosphere. While this style risks becoming overwritten, it is executed with such control and consistency that it becomes a core strength. A few metaphors, like smoke coiling into "paragraphs of remembered minutes," push conceptual boundaries but ultimately serve the story's lyrical, non-literal mode without breaking clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The core concept of a "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" using shared dreams is brilliantly original, synthesizing familiar genre elements into something startlingly new and specific. The story's true ingenuity lies in its full commitment to its lyrical premise, creating a unique methodology for magic that feels both ancient and technical. The vision is singular and executed with a confidence that makes its unconventional approach feel inevitable.</comment>
