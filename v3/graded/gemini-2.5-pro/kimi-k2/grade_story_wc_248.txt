<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation—atonement for a promise broken by fire—is viscerally established and consistently drives the narrative. Her internal conflict is powerfully embodied through actions like painting with "ink distilled from her own burnt tears." The final transformation into the archive's new heartbeat is a profound, earned change that provides a costly but resonant closure, moving beyond simple redemption into a form of sacred duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot progresses through a sequence of resonant, symbolic acts rather than strict causality, building emotional and thematic pressure. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing, as the curator's message redefines the goal from "waking me" to "remembering why stories matter," a shift paid for by the protagonist's self-immolation into the living promise. This structure is perfectly suited to the fabulist material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, a character in itself that is integral to every beat. The "archive buried beneath volcanic basalt" is not mere backdrop; its obsidian walls serve as a canvas, its mirrored chambers force confrontation, and the sarcophagus becomes the site of transformation. The environment directly constrains the protagonist's actions and charges the final image, where her "volcanic tenderness" finds its purpose as the archive's "steady glow."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing a forgotten promise—is clear and compelling. The conflict deepens through an internal, artistic trial, escalating from miniature phoenixes to the soul-baring confrontation in the mirror chamber. The final choice to become the archive is a powerful resolution born of agency, with the ultimate cost—her individual existence—made tangible and meaningful in the final lines.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of redemptive creation and the enduring life of stories emerges organically from the potent central imagery (phoenixes, palimpsests, fire forgiven). The final image of the restored self-portrait is a superb, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The score is slightly tempered by the curator's message, which states the theme a bit too directly, though the raw power of the final actions largely mitigates this slip into explication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is confident, distinct, and sustained, weaving a lyrical and elevated prose style that perfectly matches the mythological tone. The narrative perspective remains tightly focused, filtering the fantastical setting through the protagonist's guilt-haunted but determined perceptions. The consistent "volcanic" and "ash"-related imagery creates a powerful and coherent perceptual signature that defines the character's internal world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious, dense, and rhythmic, with strong sentence-level propulsion. While the high concentration of figurative language borders on overwriting, it remains coherent and thematically consistent, creating a unique and immersive texture. A few moments, such as "equations of regret," feel slightly more abstract than the otherwise concrete imagery, but the overall craft is precise, controlled, and free of technical errors or clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story is highly original, synthesizing library science, mythology, and geology into a unique and memorable fabulist premise. The core concept of an arsonist librarian atoning through subterranean art is fresh and compelling. The narrative takes significant risks, particularly with its purely symbolic progression and transformative ending, and succeeds in creating a resonant and emotionally authentic vision that is far from any familiar template.</comment>
