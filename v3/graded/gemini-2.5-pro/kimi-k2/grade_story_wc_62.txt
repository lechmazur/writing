<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and her actions are consistent, but her interiority occasionally lapses into overly diagnostic self-awareness. The moment "Mara understood the lesson: grief is not a monument but a migration" feels more like an authorial summary than an earned, embodied realization. While her journey is compelling, this tendency to articulate the theme so directly slightly undermines the character's otherwise subtle and specific internal world.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story operates on a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through imagery rather than causal turns. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing of grief from a stone to a flock—is potent and earned through Mara’s ritual action. The cost is the final, gentle dissolution of her mother’s specter, leaving Mara to carry the new custom alone. The time compression ("Mara spent the next weeks...") is a slight weakness in immediacy, but it functions adequately within this fable-like structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional, functioning as a crucible for the entire narrative. The ancient greenhouse, with its "wet loam and bruised citrus" and "thundering calm," is a liminal space that enables the story's magic and constrains its action. Key objects—the ribbon, the stone—are not merely descriptive but are central to the plot mechanics and charge the final, resonant image of the community weeping on the village green.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to shape and release collective grief—is established immediately and remains the focus. The conflict is primarily internal, with pressure applied by the spectral mentor's guidance. A key deepening occurs with the instruction "The shape you seek is not in the stone but in the space where the butterflies rise," which reorients Mara’s efforts and makes the resolution possible. The cost is legible in the mentor's final departure and Mara's assumption of a solitary, ongoing duty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story's greatest strength—its powerful central metaphor of grief as migration—is also the source of its most significant flaw. The theme is beautifully rendered through imagery, but the narrative repeatedly distrusts its own subtext by stating the theme directly. The line "Mara understood the lesson..." is an unnecessary gloss, and the final poem "Grief is the echo of love learning to fly" feels like a concluding moral that flattens the earned complexity. This thematic over-articulation prevents an otherwise brilliant piece from achieving flawless execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyrical, distinct, and impeccably maintained, creating a tone that is both somber and luminous. The third-person limited POV remains tightly focused on Mara, and her perceptions are filtered through a consistent, "fiercely meditative" sensibility. The sparse, spectral dialogue is handled perfectly, adding to the otherworldly atmosphere without disrupting the narrative's poetic rhythm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density and striking, original imagery ("monarchs...brushed her cheeks like warm ash," "stars appeared like chisel marks in the dark"). Sentence and paragraph structure vary to create a compelling rhythm that carries the reader through the fable-like narrative. The writing is clean, evocative, and free of distracting artifacts, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, inherited poetry, spectral guidance, and butterfly migration as a mechanism for processing communal grief is highly original and masterfully executed. The story transforms the familiar trope of talking to a ghost into a profound, ritualistic exploration of memory and release. The core concept feels both unique and, in hindsight, inevitable, marking a truly distinctive artistic vision.</comment>
