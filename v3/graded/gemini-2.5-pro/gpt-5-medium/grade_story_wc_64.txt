<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's characterization is exceptional. His defining traits—"blithe" yet "shadowed," "tenderly organized"—are not just labels; they directly motivate his patient, kind methodology. The internal contradiction is beautifully resolved when his "blithe mask soften[s] into respect," an earned change that feels both subtle and profound. The motivation is clear and consistent, and his actions are a direct extension of his established personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story follows a flawless Causal drive lens, where each discovery logically and elegantly propels the next action. The structure is tight, moving from the silo to the empty grave to the final revelation with escalating stakes. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change in knowledge, resulting in a Resonant Reconfiguration of the gardener's understanding and purpose, with the cost felt in the weight of the widow's lifelong secret. This is a perfectly executed short-form plot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in atmospheric and functional detail. The "cobalt silo" is not just a location but a "listening metal" that participates in the story, and the tapestry is the central plot device. Key objects—the sovereign case, the needle, the chess clock—are integral to the action and constrain choices, satisfying the 9+ gate. The sensory language ("velvet unwinding," "lunar gray") is evocative and consistent, creating a tangible, memorable world that is inseparable from the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The stake—"to discover the shape of intentions"—is signaled early and masterfully concretized as the search for a hidden truth. The conflict escalates beautifully through the gardener's agency, from a gentle intellectual puzzle to a physical act of uncovering a lie. The final revelation carries a clear, felt cost: the burden of the widow's secret and the complex reality of her love and sacrifice. The story demonstrates a single, meaningful deepening of stakes with exceptional control.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme is handled with remarkable subtlety and power. The story explores grief, memory, and the nature of truth without a single line of overt moralizing. The core theme emerges organically from the plot, culminating in the idea that the tapestry's border "told both truths at once." The final image of the gardener preparing to plant poppies is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions, honoring the complexity of the widow's choices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and impeccably controlled. The elevated, lyrical prose establishes a unique perceptual signature focused on texture, sound, and pattern, which perfectly suits the gardener's character. POV is held with absolute stability, and psychic distance is expertly managed to build a sense of quiet intimacy and ritual. The prose itself becomes an act of characterization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious and often brilliant, with high information density and striking figurative language ("knots sit like punctuation in a stubborn sentence"). However, the density occasionally verges on overwriting, particularly in the opening sentences. A phrase like "exhales a hush that sounds like velvet unwinding from a well-kept secret" is beautiful but risks overwhelming the reader with multiple layers of metaphor. This slight lack of restraint in a few key moments is the only element holding the craft back from perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story is highly original, synthesizing disparate elements—a cemetery, a silo, a tapestry, a chess clock—into a coherent and resonant whole. The premise of decoding a secret map of intentions woven into a funerary tapestry is fresh and compelling. The story avoids all genre clichés, delivering an emotionally complex and unpredictable resolution that feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable.</comment>
