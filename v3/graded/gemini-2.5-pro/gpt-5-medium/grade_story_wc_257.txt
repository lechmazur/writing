<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Characterization is exceptional and deeply integrated. The narrator's shift from a paralyzed artist to a "tutor of endings" is earned through a series of specific, ritualistic actions. Her internal conflict is shown, not told, through the charged objects she handles—the tools, the beads, the vellum. The final stasis is a powerful renunciation of her old life and an acceptance of a new, costly purpose, fulfilling the 9+ quick test with grace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story employs a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot progresses not through causal turns but through a deepening of ritual and purpose, moving from a private act of memory to a public service. The closure is a perfect example of Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), landing with the felt cost of a life dedicated to tending grief. The structure is elegant, and the lens holds perfectly from start to finish.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The observatory functions as a powerful, indispensable micro-setting. It is not merely a backdrop but the primary tool and crucible for the character's transformation, constraining and enabling her choices. The projector, the dome, and the vellum stencil are all integrated into the story's core action and charge the final, resonant image of the lily glowing from fingerprints. This is a masterclass in using setting to drive narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The central conflict is a quiet but potent internal struggle against grief-induced paralysis, with the dominant stake being the protagonist's ability to find a new purpose. The pressure deepens beautifully under an accumulative lens, moving from a personal test to the shared burden of the community she creates. The scene with the mother and her daughter's tattoos provides a powerful intensification, and the cost of her new role—a life of perpetual watchfulness—is unmistakable in the final lines.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme is expertly woven through image and metaphor, emerging organically from the narrator’s actions. Concepts like grief as a "hinge" and the power of "intention" are grounded in concrete rituals, avoiding abstraction. While a few lines border on direct thematic statement ("intention honors even the broken plans"), they are delivered in earned, dramatic moments that prevent them from feeling like authorial intrusion. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about loss and purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The first-person voice is masterful: lyrical, precise, and consistent. The narrator's perceptual signature as a jeweler shapes every observation, lending the prose a unique texture of metal, light, and delicate craft. The psychic distance is perfectly controlled, and the rhythm of the sentences modulates with the story's quiet, intense emotional arc. It is a memorable and singular narrative voice that fully satisfies the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prose is luminous and highly polished, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft. Information density is high, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs of characterization, world-building, and emotional progression. The figurative language—"Light found dust like a river finds silt," "a thin ring cool as pocket water"—is consistently fresh and effective. There are no loops, scaffolding, or overwriting, resulting in a seamless and propulsive read.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story's premise is strikingly original, synthesizing the disparate worlds of mourning jewelry, astronomy, and grief counseling into a coherent and moving whole. The transformation of a planetarium into a therapeutic space is an ingenious narrative choice. Every element feels specific and inevitable in hindsight, creating a vision that is both unique and emotionally resonant, far exceeding any genre template.</comment>
