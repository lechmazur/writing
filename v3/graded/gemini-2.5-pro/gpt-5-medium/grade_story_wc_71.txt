<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is singular and powerfully executed, functioning as the story's engine. Character is revealed entirely through a unique perceptual filter and a specific, peculiar methodology. The final earned shift in understanding acts as a potent character arc, resolving the core motive with a conceptual cost that feels both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot advances through a sequence of three distinct encounters that deepen the central question, leading to a perfectly landed Conceptual Repricing in the final paragraph. The closure is on-page, the cost is legible, and the logic is impeccable for this mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's defining strength, with sensory details that are both vivid and purposeful. The micro-setting of "displaced objects" is brilliantly employed not just as description but as the primary tool that constrains action and directly charges the final, resonant image of the beetle tin. The setting is not a backdrop; it is the core mechanism of the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The epistemological stake—to understand living houses—is established immediately and escalates perfectly through the counter-example of the "dead" second house. This turn narrows the protagonist's options and forces a re-evaluation of their method. The conflict is resolved entirely through the protagonist's unique agency, with a clear conceptual cost paid in the final realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The theme of attention and memory imbuing the inanimate with life emerges with extraordinary grace from the story's concrete particulars. The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central inquiry, recontextualizing the entire narrative without resorting to a simplistic moral. The final image of setting something down and meaning to return is a masterclass in thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct, consistent, and controlled, establishing a memorable perceptual signature from the first sentence. The lyrical, almost incantatory prose is inseparable from the narrator’s character and worldview. Psychic distance remains perfectly calibrated, drawing the reader into a specific, idiosyncratic mode of seeing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose is luminous, with high information density and a stunning command of figurative language. The rhythm is controlled and sentences are beautifully constructed to serve the hushed, intense atmosphere. A fractional deduction accounts for one or two similes that border on precious, a hairline crack in an otherwise flawless surface, such as "creeping normality rehearsed by a heart."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise of a "creeping normality noticer" is highly original and confidently executed, offering a fresh, profound angle on the familiar idea of place-memory. The synthesis of sensory observation, poetic metaphor, and a quasi-mystical method feels entirely unique. The story takes significant risks with its lyrical density and succeeds completely.</comment>
