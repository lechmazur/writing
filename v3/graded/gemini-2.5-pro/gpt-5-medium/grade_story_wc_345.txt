<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The collective "we" narrator is effectively established as a single entity, but lacks the internal contradiction and specific flaws of a singular protagonist. The primary internal conflict ("We argued, because hope here is brambled") is stated rather than dramatized through competing actions in a scene. The transformation to unity is believable within the story's lyric mode, but the shift relies on the external crisis rather than a more granular internal reckoning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive perfectly. It layers details about Lio, the bell, and the chalk to build a reservoir of trust that pays off during the crisis. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration; the community's departure is a decisive change, and the final image of the nebula showing "bruises without shame" makes the conceptual cost of leaving their world legible and emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional and indispensable, functioning as a primary driver of conflict and resolution. The "floating rock arches" are not mere scenery; a collapsing shard creates the central crisis, directly threatening the community. The environment constrains every choice, from the "hammocks" for homes to the final escape on a "river of air," charging the final image with a sense of both loss and liberation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—achieving a collective solace—is clearly signaled and powerfully tested. The falling arch provides a superb, high-pressure tightening that forces the community to move beyond their "brambled" arguments and act. The successful rescue earns the resolution, and the cost is clear and significant: they must abandon their home entirely to preserve their newfound unity. The escalation from internal friction to external crisis is seamless.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme is expertly woven through image and action, culminating in a resonant final insight without moralizing. The concept of shared vulnerability is beautifully dramatized in the rescue and then articulated in the earned line about the nebula showing "to people who are tired together rather than tired alone." The final image of trading apologies "like seeds" offers a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question about how a broken community heals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The collective "we" voice is maintained with masterful consistency, creating a distinct, lyrical, and elegiac tone. The prose has a memorable perceptual signature and rhythm, evident in phrases like "hope here is brambled" and "a humble comet." The psychic distance is perfectly controlled for a reflective, myth-like narrative, establishing a voice that is both intimate and epic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is luminous and imaginative, with high information density. However, the sheer density of figurative language occasionally risks becoming overwrought, slightly dulling the momentum in a few passages. For instance, the climax contains multiple poetic descriptions where simpler, more direct prose might have heightened the tension. The repetition of "reexamine" feels like a minor scaffold rather than an intentional echo, a small blemish on otherwise excellent craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story is highly original, synthesizing speculative fiction, pastoral fantasy, and post-disaster genres into a unique and coherent vision. The premise of a benevolent ghost guiding a fractured community via chalk and a watering bell feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. It transforms the trope of a wise mentor by making the guide incorporeal and the guidance indirect, forcing the community's own agency to the forefront.</comment>
