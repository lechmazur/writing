<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is rendered with exceptional specificity and consistency. Motivation is clear and deeply rooted in a believable professional and personal ethos ("discover the shape of collective grief without breaking it"). The internal conflict between the certainty of the craft and the necessary ambiguity of grief is dramatized beautifully through the use of the poem-marked ribbon, culminating in an earned change of practice—a choice with the felt cost of letting go of control.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure, paced by the butterfly migration, builds thematic density rather than causal turns, leading to a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration at the close. The final image of the "single spare curve" for the kite provides potent, earned closure, re-casting the entire story's meditation on grief with a sense of quiet mastery. The cost is the acceptance of grief's unending, migratory nature.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active, breathing agent in the story. The greenhouse's "thundering calm" and its physical state (cracked roof, condensation) directly constrain and shape the protagonist's emotional and professional choices, acting as a conduit for the mother's "spectral mentorship." Sensory details are vivid, purposeful, and consistently filtered through the carver's unique perspective, making the environment indispensable to the story's closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to hold collective grief without breaking—is established early and artfully deepened by the arrival of the grieving father. His request for "words strong enough to hold the date" forces the protagonist’s internal process into a shared, high-stakes application. The resolution, achieved through a sustained, meditative process rather than a single confrontation, feels earned, and the cost is legible in the season-long dedication to the craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The theme of grief as a migratory, cyclical process is developed with extraordinary grace, primarily through the central metaphor of the butterflies. It emerges organically from character, action, and image, resisting any form of moralizing. The final image of the carved kite is a perfect, resonant, and non-literal answer to the story's central question, providing a powerful emotional aftereffect without a single word of explicit summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is the story's greatest strength: lyrical, meditative, and utterly distinct. The prose itself embodies the character's "fiercely meditative" nature, with a perceptual signature that consistently filters the world through the lens of carving, memory, and nature. The POV is flawlessly controlled, and the psychic distance modulates perfectly between intimate reflection and professional observation, creating a voice that is both authoritative and vulnerable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prose demonstrates exceptional control of rhythm, syntax, and imagery, achieving a high information density where nearly every sentence serves multiple functions. While the density of figurative language is high, it remains coherent and sustains the established voice rather than feeling ornamental. The sentences are meticulously crafted, with no evidence of scaffolding or redundancy, resulting in a momentum that is both stately and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>This story transforms a familiar subject—grief and memory—through a highly specific and original synthesis of elements: gravestone carving, poetry, a greenhouse setting, and the butterfly migration. The concept of "spectral mentorship" as a quiet, guiding hush is a particularly fresh and effective choice. The emotional truth is profound, and the execution is so specific that the story feels inevitable and wholly its own.</comment>
