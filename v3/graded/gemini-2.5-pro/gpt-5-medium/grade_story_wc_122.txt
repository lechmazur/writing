<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is viscerally established and her internal journey is compelling. The characterization is strong, particularly in its embodiment of sensation. A minor deduction is for the moment of slightly too-perfect self-awareness near the end ("yet she had already stopped without noticing"), which feels more like an authorial summary than an earned, in-the-moment realization and slightly undercuts the subtlety of the final beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot builds through increasing metaphorical and sensory density, leading to a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration for the protagonist. The closure is earned, occurs on the page with a clear felt cost, and the internal, metaphorical causality is perfectly consistent with the world's logic, satisfying the 9+ gate for structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The cavern is not a setting but a participant, actively shaping the story's events by "swallowing sound" and enabling the central experiment. Both the cavern and the micro-setting of the drum constrain choice and charge the final image, making the environment indispensable to the plot and theme. The sensory details are selective, purposeful, and filtered beautifully through Mara's unique POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mara's fight against emotional numbness—is signaled immediately and deepens effectively under the story's textural pressure. The escalation is internal and perceptual, culminating in a stance crystallization that feels earned and carries the legible cost of rediscovered vulnerability. The story wisely avoids external conflict to focus on a high-stakes internal battle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of healing through a different kind of listening emerges organically from the story’s potent imagery. However, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary ("She would teach the art of listening backward to move forward," "The hush she carried was no absence, only a way for presence to travel..."). This explicit moralizing slightly weakens the resonance of the final image, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is exceptional: lyrical, controlled, and possessing a distinct perceptual signature rooted in tactile sensation. POV is flawlessly maintained, with psychic distance modulating effectively to match emotional intensity. The prose itself becomes an extension of the character, fulfilling the highest standards for voice and perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious, rhythmically sophisticated, and demonstrates high information density. The figurative language is largely brilliant and integrated. The score is held back from the highest tier by the final paragraph, which shifts from the potent "showing" of the central scene to "telling" the outcome and its future implications, slightly reducing the momentum of the otherwise powerful ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The premise is strikingly original, synthesizing concepts of deafness, music, memory, and healing into a memorable and singular vision. The story commits fully to its unique metaphorical logic, transforming familiar tropes into something fresh and emotionally authentic. The execution feels inevitable in hindsight, a hallmark of true ingenuity.</comment>
