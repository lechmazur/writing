<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse keeper's character is rendered with exceptional consistency and depth. His motivation to decode the gesture is clear, and his method of "observing gaps" is not just a label but a demonstrated practice that drives the plot. The internal conflict between his isolated nature and the empathetic act of communication is subtly and effectively dramatized, culminating in an action that feels both inevitable and costly, as he accepts the "weight" of being a witness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story's structure is flawless under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is immediate and evocative, and the narrative progresses through a deepening of understanding rather than conventional plot turns. The closure is a masterfully handled Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise); the act of signaling and accepting the ambiguous reply provides a profound sense of resolution, with the felt cost of his new role as keeper of this memory making the ending resonate powerfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant in the story. The "opal dock" is a superb, atmospheric anchor, while the micro-setting of the "notch rubbed bright" is the story's narrative and thematic core, acting as a lock, a memory-holder, and a physical constraint that directs the final choice. This integration of environment and action is seamless and essential, with the dock itself holding the key to the mystery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The central stake—whether a final gesture finds meaning or is lost to the sea—is established immediately and maintained with quiet intensity. The pressure escalates not through external threats but through the narrator's deepening investigation, culminating in the discovery at the piling, which redefines the puzzle. The protagonist's agency drives this escalation, and the cost of his success is legibly felt in his acceptance of a solemn, isolating duty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Thematic exploration of witnessing, memory, and the persistence of human connection is handled with masterful subtext. The central theme emerges organically from the narrator's actions and the recurring image of the Edelweiss, which gains weight with each mention. The final image of the ambiguous answering light is a perfect, non-literal resolution that powerfully resonates without resorting to a stated moral, leaving a lasting impression of quiet hope and solemn duty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is the story's greatest strength: singular, poetic, and utterly consistent. The prose has a distinct rhythm and a perceptual signature focused on absence and detail, perfectly embodying the "eccentric lighthouse keeper." POV is flawlessly controlled, with a psychic distance that draws the reader into the narrator's contemplative, meticulous worldview. It is a memorable and beautifully executed voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is lyrical, dense, and demonstrates exceptional control of rhythm and imagery. Sentences are crafted for maximum impact, advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously, such as in "Witnessed isolation has a weight to it, a careful temperature that does not burn but never quite warms." While the figurative language is consistently rich, it occasionally borders on being overly dense, but never to the point of obscuring clarity or momentum, remaining in service of the powerful voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story transforms the familiar trope of the wise, solitary guardian into something fresh and poignant. Its ingenuity lies in the central mechanism—decoding a message not from words but from the echo of a past gesture preserved in wood. The quiet, ambiguous resolution avoids melodrama and delivers a more profound emotional truth, creating a memorable synthesis of character, setting, and theme that feels both original and inevitable.</comment>
