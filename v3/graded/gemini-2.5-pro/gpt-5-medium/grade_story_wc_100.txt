<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The undertaker's motivation is established with poetic precision and held with unwavering consistency. His weariness and stubborn sense of duty are not just stated but embodied in his actions, culminating in an earned transformation from a hired professional to a permanent keeper. The line "grief taught me to lift what the living cannot carry" provides a profound, character-specific anchor for his choices, making the final act of devotion feel inevitable and deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly, building pressure through atmosphere and imagery rather than conventional plot turns. The structure is an elegant, single arc: inciting incident (package), descent, ritual, and a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) for closure. The final image of the library as a "patient registry" provides a definitive "after" state, with the cost being the protagonist's absorption into his work, making the conclusion both satisfying and haunting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is a tour de force of speculative fiction, rendered with stunning specificity and lyricism. The "forgotten underwater city library" is not mere backdrop; it is the central mechanism of the plot, the source of the conflict's resolution, and the story's final, indelible image. Details like "books float on tethers" and "shelves lean like old divers" create a world that is both fantastical and emotionally coherent, directly constraining the character's actions and charging the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story masterfully defines its stakes as a struggle for quiescent memory against restless distress. The conflict escalates as the "chased stillness" manifests as a physical presence, "a mantled thing," which tests the dome, providing a clear moment of external pressure. The protagonist's agency is absolute; his stubborn, methodical work directly counters the entropic patience of the sea, earning a resolution where the cost is his own permanent change in status.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Thematic exploration of rest, memory, and belonging is seamlessly integrated into the narrative's imagery and action. The central idea that "rest is not surrender but location" is powerfully dramatized rather than merely stated. The transformation of the distress signal "SOS" into "SOR" (stay or rest) is a brilliant thematic crystallization, and the final image of the library provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The voice is the story's superlative achievement—weary, mythic, and utterly distinctive. The prose exhibits a powerful perceptual signature, filtering the surreal events through the practical, somber lens of an undertaker who thinks in terms of "addresses," "linen," and "forwarding orders." This consistency gives the fantastical story a profound sense of emotional gravity and internal logic, with syntax and rhythm perfectly modulated to the story's quiet, inexorable momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished to a mirror sheen, demonstrating exceptional information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is abundant yet purposeful, building the world's unique texture without becoming overwrought. Each sentence contributes to momentum and atmosphere, with no evidence of scaffolding or redundancy. The line-level craft is impeccable, creating a piece that is as beautiful to read for its sentences as it is for its story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story presents a highly original synthesis of familiar mythic elements—the keeper of the dead, a drowned city, a lighthouse—into a singular, memorable vision. The concept of an underwater library for souls, where distress signals are cataloged in books, is fresh and brilliantly executed. The narrative commits fully to its surreal premise, resulting in a piece that feels both timeless and entirely new, transforming genre tropes into something deeply personal and artistically coherent.</comment>
