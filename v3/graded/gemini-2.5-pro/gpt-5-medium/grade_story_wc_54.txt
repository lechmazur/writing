<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation is exceptionally clear, specific, and consistent. The voice, rooted in an engineering mindset (“hope was a system”), is perfectly sustained, turning abstract concepts into concrete actions. The arrival of the janitor provides an ideal secondary pressure, grounding the narrator's intellectual quest in immediate human need, which earns the final shift from solitary project to communal responsibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The structure is flawless for this length, operating on a Hybrid (Accumulative -> Causal) lens. The first half accumulates small, methodical changes, while the janitor's arrival provides a perfect causal pivot that drives the narrative to a powerful Decisive Change. The closure lands with a clear, felt cost—the shift from quiet wonder to the "proportional headaches of functioning mercy"—making the earned resolution deeply resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is not merely a backdrop but the story's central character and conflict. The terminal's specific state of disrepair—its "wrong flows"—directly constrains the protagonist's choices and defines the plot. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, and the sextant piece serves as a perfect micro-setting/tool that anchors the theme and charges the final, resonant image of navigation toward an unseen harbor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story establishes its dominant stake—to "resurrect" the terminal—and escalates it beautifully. The conflict deepens from a person-versus-environment puzzle into a person-versus-apathy challenge with real human stakes upon the janitor's arrival. The protagonist's agency drives every beat, and the final cost of ongoing responsibility is made explicit and tangible, earning the story's optimistic conclusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme—that hope is an engineered system requiring maintenance—emerges organically from the protagonist’s actions, never feeling imposed. The final paragraph risks being too explicit, but the insight "hope is engineered, not declared" reads as an earned epiphany rather than a didactic summary. The final image of the nascent community and its tools provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The voice is the story's greatest strength: a singular, sustained blend of the technical and the poetic that feels completely authentic to the "functionally creative" protagonist. The perceptual signature, which filters the world through systems, gradients, and flows, is masterfully controlled. The sparse dialogue is perfectly pitched, carrying immense weight in advancing the plot and shifting the narrator's purpose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prose is both lyrical and surgically precise, with high information density in every sentence. Figurative language is consistently strong and conceptually coherent, as in "balancing gradients against distances like budgets of mercy." The rhythm is controlled, the word choice is impeccable, and there are no wasted words, loops, or other artifacts to impede momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The piece demonstrates remarkable originality by synthesizing the disparate fields of civil engineering and existential philosophy into a quiet, hopeful narrative. It transforms the familiar trope of urban decay into a canvas for constructive action. The core concept feels fresh, and its execution is so specific and heartfelt that it avoids all cliché, resulting in a memorable and authentic vision.</comment>
