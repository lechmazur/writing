<question>1</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's character is exceptionally well-drawn through their unique profession, which serves as a worldview. The internal conflict between "fantasy" and "practicality" is dramatized effectively, culminating in the pivotal choice to discard assumptions. This choice is not merely stated but demonstrated, making the narrator's ultimate success feel deeply earned and consistent with their established traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and atmospheric, while the plot progresses through a series of resonant images and poetic causal links. The closure is a superb Conceptual Repricing, where the city's relationship to its past is reconfigured on the page with a clear, felt cost, perfectly capped by the engineer's note.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The setting is the story's masterstroke, functioning not as a backdrop but as the central mechanism of the plot. Every element—the gorge, the mast, the cables, the swollen moon—is instrumental in the climactic action. The final transformation of the city into a record player is a brilliant and inextricable fusion of setting, action, and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A clear, high-concept stake is established early and intelligently escalated. The conflict deepens not through external force but through the protagonist's necessary internal shift, a change in method that raises the personal stakes. The resolution is nuanced, satisfying the core need for "placement" over "resurrection," a trade-off that gives the ending its significant weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The theme of reconciling beginnings and endings is explored with profound sophistication, emerging organically from the story's central conceits rather than being imposed upon them. Subtext is carried masterfully in the objects—the scarred star, the clarifying hush. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, achieving a rare thematic purity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The voice is singular, confident, and unforgettable from the first sentence. It perfectly balances the poetic with the technical, establishing the "fantasy practicality" tone that makes the world feel coherent and alive. The narrative perspective is controlled with masterful precision, filtering every observation through a unique and compelling perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The prose is exceptionally dense with figurative language, yet it avoids feeling overwritten by making every metaphor do causal or thematic work. The rhythm is hypnotic and controlled, accelerating and slowing with the action. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; each sentence is information-rich and contributes to the story's powerful momentum and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>This story is a triumph of originality, seamlessly synthesizing technology, memory, and myth into a cohesive and startlingly fresh narrative. The core concept of a celestial signal interpreter and the specific mechanics of the resolution are highly inventive. The execution feels both surprising and, in hindsight, utterly inevitable—the hallmark of a truly ingenious piece of fiction.</comment>
