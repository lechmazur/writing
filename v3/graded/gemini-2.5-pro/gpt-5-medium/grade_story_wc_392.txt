<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motivation is expertly rendered, balancing professional duty against an emergent moral clarity. The internal conflict between the algorithm's preference and "fidelity to lives" is potent and dramatized through concrete choices, like turning off the radio. The backstory of the father is integrated economically via the BRR rule, anchoring in the lantern's vision and tilting the final stance without halting momentum. The shift from a required calm to a chosen calm is a subtle, masterfully executed character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through observation rather than overt causal turns. The structure is a masterclass in economy, orienting the reader immediately and driving toward a powerful closure. The final beat—filing the report and returning the lantern—is a Resonant Reconfiguration with a clear conceptual cost (professional risk, bearing witness) that redefines the protagonist's relationship to his work. The closure is earned, on-page, and lands with immense weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The setting is not just a backdrop but a primary actor in the story. The tunnel breathes, resonates, and holds history, with details like the "salt-locked drains" and "bricked niche" being central to the plot. Atmosphere is thick and purposeful, mirroring the protagonist's descent into a deeper form of inquiry. The lantern functions as a perfect micro-setting, a tool that constrains choice by offering an alternate source of authority and which decisively charges the final, resonant image of the story.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story establishes its dominant stake—systemic truth versus bureaucratic convenience—with quiet efficiency. Pressure deepens through the accumulation of sensory and historical detail, which collides with the external pressure from the supervisor's messages. The protagonist's agency is perfectly suited to his role: his decisive act is one of documentation and interpretation. The final choice to defy the algorithm carries a palpable, if implicit, professional cost, making the resolution both earned and courageous.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of collective responsibility versus systemic failure emerges organically from the story's particulars. The lantern as a symbol of shared risk and hope is potent without being heavy-handed. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about memory and duty. A minor deduction is warranted for the line "risk becomes safety only when communities share it," which borders on stating the theme directly, a slight thematic echo in an otherwise masterful display of subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The voice is singular and compelling: precise, observant, and lyrical, perfectly embodying the protagonist's "watchfully calm" nature. The POV is flawlessly controlled, filtering every observation through the investigator's professional and personal lens. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, modulating perfectly from empirical description to more resonant, internal reflection. The narrative stance is confident and consistent, creating a completely immersive experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, striking imagery ("the white teeth of thirst"), and a controlled, elegant rhythm. Sentences are crafted to do multiple jobs, advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. A few phrases like "fortified vulnerability held like a drawn line within me" slightly cross into overwriting, a minor register drift that momentarily pulls focus from the otherwise grounded voice. However, the line-level craft is overwhelmingly clean, propulsive, and artful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story achieves a rare synthesis of elements—a procedural investigation, a historical artifact, a critique of modern bureaucracy, and a personal memory—into a seamless and haunting whole. The concept of a "preventable death investigator" provides a fresh frame for exploring familiar themes of responsibility. The story's originality lies not in a shocking twist but in its profound emotional and intellectual depth, transforming a workplace tragedy into a resonant parable that feels both timeless and urgent.</comment>
