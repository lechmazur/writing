<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted effectively in her grandmother’s legacy. Her interiority is conveyed with concrete, embodied language ("restless energy that coiled in her chest"). The transformation from seeking a final answer to embracing an ongoing "reckoning" is well-earned, but the characterization lacks a moment of sharp, simultaneous internal contradiction in-scene, keeping it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The plot progresses through a series of deepening discoveries rather than conventional turns, building elegantly toward the closure. The final image provides a perfect Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Mara’s relationship to the mystery is transformed with a clear, felt cost—the release of a simple solution for a lifelong process.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The atmosphere is a primary strength, with vivid, purposeful sensory details. Crucially, the central setting element—the cathedral window—is not a backdrop but the story's primary engine of conflict, constraining every choice and charging the final image. The integration of setting, character, and plot is nearly seamless and demonstrates masterful economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The internal stake—understanding her grandmother's obsession—is signaled early and deepens with each discovery. Pressure builds effectively under the accumulative lens, with Sister Agatha's clue and the inscribed text acting as key tightening points. Mara’s agency drives the resolution, and the conceptual cost is legible at the end, though the conflict remains almost entirely internal with minimal external friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges with subtlety and power from the story's central images: the night-blooming flowers and the layered glass. The final image of the "unbroken" layer provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question. However, the penultimate paragraph dips into thematic summary ("Flowers bloom at night not in defiance, but in communion"), a moment of telling that slightly undermines the otherwise masterful showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is controlled with precision, and the narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent. Mara's perceptual signature as a visual artist shapes what she notices, lending authenticity to her discoveries. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and character-differentiating, efficiently advancing the plot without any wasted words.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose is elegant, with strong verbs and a varied, compelling rhythm. Information density is high, with no noticeable scaffolding or repetitive phrasing. The only minor vulnerability is the sheer density of figurative language; while generally effective, its consistent elevation borders on overwriting and slightly smooths over the texture of the character's voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of nocturnal botany, artistic obsession, and cryptic architecture is highly original. The story transforms the familiar trope of a posthumous mystery by delivering a philosophical, rather than factual, resolution. This conceptual risk pays off, creating a memorable and intellectually satisfying narrative that feels both fresh and inevitable.</comment>
