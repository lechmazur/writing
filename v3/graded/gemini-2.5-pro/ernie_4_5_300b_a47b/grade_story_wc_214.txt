<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Zara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority sometimes uses abstract, diagnostic language ("a heart that had learned to hold both grief and wonder in equal measure") rather than showing contradictory impulses in the moment. Veyra functions more as a thematic counterpoint than a fully realized character, making his final, subtle shift feel slightly convenient. The characterization is strong but stops short of exceptional due to these elements of telling over showing in the internal landscape.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building toward a quiet but potent closure. The ending is a Conceptual Repricing: the speck of stardust in the lantern reframes the science/spirit conflict, landing with a felt cost represented by the star's absence and the lantern's dimmed light. The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the story's length and ambitions, with a clear before/after shift in understanding between the characters.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is deeply evocative and integral to the story's mood and theme. Specific details like the "domes, etched with the faded glow of ancient constellations" and the "shards of obsidian" create a tangible, unique world. The yellow lantern glass functions as a perfect micro-setting; it's a tool that constrains action and directly charges the final, resonant image, fulfilling the requirement for excellence in this category.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear internal stake—Zara's search for "strength in vulnerability"—and tests it through a single, meaningful escalation. Her choice to leave the station and seek the impact site is a decisive turn driven by her agency. The cost is legible in the missed report and the emotional weight of witnessing the star's end, and the resolution with Veyra provides a satisfying, if quiet, release of the central tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme of reconciling science and spirit emerges organically from the central conflict and the story's key images, particularly the final one. However, the last two paragraphs slip into direct thematic summary, which undermines the earned resonance of the preceding scene. Lines like "the real work happened in the margins" and "the universe paused to acknowledge her" state the moral rather than allowing the image of the stardust to carry the full weight of the conclusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, controlled psychic distance that suits the story's contemplative tone. The prose has a distinct texture, and Zara's perception feels specific. A minor friction exists in the highly poetic register of the narration, which occasionally feels more authorial than rooted in the perspective of a "janitor," but it's a consistent and stylistically coherent choice that largely succeeds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and polished, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, the final paragraph acts as a scaffold, summarizing the story's meaning after the true emotional climax has already occurred in the scene with Veyra, which dulls the ending's momentum. Additionally, some key concepts like "flourishing stillness" and "primal elegance" are repeated as labels rather than being fully dramatized, a minor but noticeable artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise of a "cosmic janitor" finding spiritual meaning in celestial mechanics is fresh and thoughtfully executed. While the skeptic/believer dynamic with Veyra is a familiar trope, the story transforms it through its specific, atmospheric setting and the quiet intensity of Zara's internal journey. The synthesis of a sci-fi backdrop with a deeply personal, spiritual quest feels distinctive and memorable.</comment>
