<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, anchored effectively by the hair ribbon and the memory of her daughter. Her interiority is concrete, though it occasionally strays into self-summary. The character is compellingly stubborn, but the final beats of the story articulate her earned wisdom a bit too neatly, trading embodied realization for a slightly diagnostic summary of her own growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, and its structure serves this lens perfectly. Orientation is established immediately and gracefully. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (RR)—the blooming of the orchard—that lands with the felt cost of Lira's long, solitary persistence. The causal chain is symbolic rather than mechanical, which is a strength in this mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is the story's greatest strength: an orchard in the rafters of a cathedral is a stunning, memorable image. It's deeply integrated into the plot, acting as both obstacle (requiring Lira to climb) and objective (the thing she vows to save). The environment directly constrains character action and charges the final, resonant image of the glowing quartz eye, meeting the highest standard for this category.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lira’s vow to persist against abandonment and decay—is established early and held throughout. The conflict is primarily internal and environmental, fitting the story's quiet nature. The mending of the quartz eye serves as a meaningful deepening of this stake, and the subsequent blooming provides a resolution with a clear, felt cost: years of lonely, defiant effort are validated, foreclosing the option of despair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The themes of mending, endurance, and finding value in the discarded are potent and emerge organically from the story's central action. However, the final third of the narrative explicitly summarizes its own meaning. Lines like "Lira had learned that wisdom wasn’t found in grand contracts..." and the direct reference to "accidental wisdom" function as thematic moralizing, which weakens the resonance of the otherwise powerful final images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The point of view is controlled and consistent, maintaining a close psychic distance that suits the intimate, reflective narrative. The voice is lyrical and distinct, with a memorable perceptual signature; Lira notices the world through the lens of mending and memory. The prose has a specific texture that feels unique to this character and her strange, beautiful world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is clean, evocative, and often beautiful, with high information density in its descriptions. The rhythm and syntax support the story's contemplative pace. The final paragraphs, however, exhibit some minor repetitive sentence structures ("She’d done it. She’d mended... She’d mended...") and a shift into summary that slightly dulls the momentum established by the strong scene work preceding it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core premise is exceptionally fresh and imaginative. A "quartz-eye mender" operating in a cathedral reclaimed by an orchard is a powerful and original synthesis of fantasy, post-apocalyptic, and literary elements. The story commits fully to its unique concept, transforming familiar themes of loss and endurance into something that feels entirely new and specific.</comment>
