<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation is clear and her internal arc from investigator to creator is compelling and earned. Her interiority is rendered with particularity, especially in her connection to the wood grain. The father’s final lines ("Necessary distances...") verge on thematic summary, slightly flattening his character into a mouthpiece for the story's conclusion, which prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story executes a hybrid Accumulative-Causal structure flawlessly. It builds a textural, mysterious atmosphere where Lira gathers clues, leading to a causal climax where her action (writing a new code) directly triggers the resolution. The closure is a Decisive Change with a clear, felt cost—the inability to revisit a sacred threshold—which is both resonant and structurally sound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional and functions as a primary driver of the plot. The "drifting prism terrace" is a memorable, dynamic environment that constrains and enables Lira’s choices—its alignment literally reveals the path forward. The specific sensory details, from the shifting wood grain to the "fractured hush," are seamlessly integrated and charge the final image with meaning, far surpassing mere description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The central stake—understanding the past to navigate the future—is established early and deepens effectively. The escalation is handled through a key shift in knowledge, when Lira realizes the codes map temporal changes, which fundamentally reweights the conflict. The resolution is driven by her agency, and the cost of moving forward is made explicit and felt, satisfying the demands of a high-stakes emotional journey.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of "necessary distances" and "sacred thresholds" is artfully woven through image and action, culminating in the powerful final beat of Lira creating her own language. However, the father's dialogue ("Sometimes you have to walk away to see how close you are") is a moment of thematic echo, stating the core idea too directly. This small authorial intrusion slightly undermines the subtext and prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, distinct perceptual signature throughout. The narrative distance is expertly controlled, drawing the reader into Lira’s specific, almost synesthetic way of interpreting the world through texture and code. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the tension, demonstrating a high level of authorial control and artistry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is dense and highly figurative but remains clear and purposeful, avoiding the trap of overwriting. Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm, and there are no discernible scaffold phrases or loops. Every word works to build the story's unique atmosphere and advance Lira's internal state, resulting in prose with exceptional information density and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story's synthesis of architecture, magical realism, and personal cartography is highly original and executed with confidence. It transforms the familiar trope of a lost child returning home into a sophisticated meditation on memory and meaning. The central conceits—the drifting terrace and the temporal weather codes—are fresh, memorable, and feel inevitable to the story's emotional logic.</comment>
