<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her inherited vocation. Her internal conflict between the director's pragmatism and her own creative hope is well-dramatized. The final shift from "caretaker" to "collaborator" provides a satisfying arc for this length, earned by her actions. The characterization is strong, showing her competence and determination through precise, ritualistic movements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and internal pressure toward a solution. The structure is a clean, single scene with a clear inciting incident and resolution. The closure is an effective Resonant Reconfiguration, where Lirael's understanding of preservation evolves, with the cost being the irrecoverable loss of the original sound, which is reframed as a gain. Causality is emotional and intuitive, fitting the story's logic perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a standout success, both highly imaginative and integral to the plot. The "opal library above clouds" and the "glass-orchids" are not mere backdrops; they are active participants in the story's conflict and resolution. The wind chime and orchids directly constrain Lirael's choices and are central to the final, resonant image of the library humming in response to the new song, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The stake—the potential shattering of the library's fragile equilibrium—is established immediately and remains the dominant pressure. The conflict escalates not through external events but through Lirael’s internal agency as she defies the director’s finality. The crucial choice to create a new harmony, rather than mourn the old, carries the clear cost of altering the past forever, a price she willingly pays, making the resolution feel earned and decisive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of preservation as evolution rather than stasis is potent and well-integrated. However, it is slightly weakened by being stated too directly in both narration ("preservation wasn’t about freezing time...") and dialogue ("You’ve preserved the act of remembering."). While the final image of a new emotion rising is a powerful, non-literal answer, these thematic statements in the final third feel like unnecessary summary, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical, confident, and perfectly matched to the story's fantastical, melancholic atmosphere. The close third-person POV remains stable, providing a distinct perceptual signature focused on sound, resonance, and delicate systems. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with Lirael's focus and actions. The hologram's voice, a "cascade of opalescent static," is a concise and effective contrast.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong sensory details ("prismatic whispers," "sighed into silence"). The rhythm is well-controlled and the word choice precise. Minor deductions are for a few instances of common phrasing ("her chest tightened") and a slightly precious descriptor ("foxglove regret") that momentarily breaks the otherwise seamless texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise of a museum for extinct feelings, tended by a librarian in a cloud palace, is wonderfully original. The story synthesizes fantasy, sci-fi, and a quiet philosophical question into a cohesive whole. The resolution—embracing imperfection to create a new, living harmony—is an ingenious transformation of a simple "repair" plot into something more profound and memorable.</comment>
