<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is exceptional. The protagonist's core contradiction—a professional liar compelled to uncover the truth—is established immediately and drives the entire narrative. The final choice to reveal the truth is not an unearned epiphany but a costly renunciation of his trade, earned through the story's events. The internal conflict is made tangible through his interactions with the watch and driftwood.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story executes a flawless Hybrid (Causal-dominant) structure. The plot advances through a clear "because/therefore" chain, culminating in a Decisive Change that reconfigures the protagonist's goal. The closure, a Charged Poise as he walks back to the terrace, lands with a perfectly legible emotional and professional cost, making the story's "before" and "after" states starkly different.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully integrated, functioning as a primary agent of the plot. The driftwood-strewn beach is not mere backdrop but the very tool that forces the story’s central discovery and enables the final choice. The recurring cobalt terrace provides a potent atmospheric frame, its changing appearance mirroring the protagonist's deepening moral crisis, fully satisfying the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Conflict and stakes escalate with precision. The initial professional dilemma deepens into a profound moral crisis upon the discovery of the erased brother, a turn driven entirely by the protagonist's agency. The final choice to break the silence carries an unmistakable on-page cost—the potential loss of a client and the violation of his professional ethos—which powerfully charges the story's final moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Thematic exploration of truth, memory, and silence is subtle and resonant. The story avoids any overt moralizing, instead allowing the theme to emerge organically from the central metaphor of the "sieved hush" and the physical act of uncovering secrets from driftwood. The final image provides a complex, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the weight of truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is confident, consistent, and possesses a distinct perceptual signature fitting for a melancholic man in a secret-laden trade. The third-person limited POV remains tightly controlled, modulating narrative distance effectively as Elias moves from professional detachment to personal moral implication. The prose rhythm and texture perfectly support the story's noir-tinged, speculative atmosphere.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While the prose is largely evocative and precise, the central discovery scene relies on a noticeable template cadence ("He knelt... He picked up... He closed his eyes... He opened his eyes... He continued his search..."). This repetitive sentence structure slightly dulls the momentum and creates a mechanical feel during a pivotal sequence, preventing the piece from reaching the highest tier of line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise of a psychic, black-market genealogist who reads driftwood is brilliantly original, synthesizing elements of noir, fantasy, and psychological drama into a seamless and compelling whole. The story commits fully to its unique conceit, using it to explore universal themes in a way that feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable. This is a memorable and inventive piece.</comment>
