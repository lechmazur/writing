<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation is exceptionally clear and poetically rendered, driving all her actions. Her interiority is consistent, though it lacks a moment of significant internal contradiction or doubt that would deepen her "hauntingly optimistic" endurance. Her competence is well-established, but the struggle feels more physical ("fingers raw") than psychological, keeping her characterization just shy of the highest tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building pressure through layered actions rather than causal turns. The structure is clean, with excellent orientation and a clear Decisive Change at the end—the labyrinth is restored. The cost is legible (raw fingers, fulfilled plates), but feels slightly light for the scale of the magical act, which is the only element holding this back from a perfect score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a standout success, functioning as both atmosphere and an active participant in the plot. Specific details like the murals and symbolic junctions directly constrain Lira's choices, satisfying the 9+ gate. The sensory details are vivid and filtered perfectly through Lira's poetic POV, making the labyrinth feel ancient and alive. The recurring object—the storybook plate—is central to both navigation and the climax, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The central conflict—Lira versus the labyrinth's decay—is established immediately and escalates steadily toward the climax in the cavern. The dominant stake ("ruin to reverence") is consistently tested by her patient work. The resolution is earned entirely through her agency, and the cost, while modest, is visible on the page. The story deepens the stakes effectively within its accumulative structure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of mending, resilience, and reverence emerges organically from the protagonist's actions. The final image of the refilling tide pools provides a powerful, resonant answer to the opening image without resorting to a simplistic moral. However, the last sentence ("a reminder that even broken precedents could be mended...") comes very close to stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the otherwise masterful subtext and preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is the story's greatest strength: consistent, lyrical, and possessing a distinct perceptual signature. The prose rhythm and sophisticated diction perfectly match the "poetic wharf weaver" character, creating an immersive and authoritative narrative stance. Psychic distance is expertly controlled, and the entire piece reads with a singular, confident vision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The line-level craft is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the prose is saturated with figurative language, which at times risks becoming overwriting and slightly dulls the momentum through its sheer density. A few moments of plainer, more direct prose during key actions would have provided powerful contrast and heightened the impact of the more lyrical passages.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core concept of magically sewing a ruined structure back to wholeness is highly original and thoughtfully executed. It transforms the familiar labyrinth trope into a canvas for resilience and creation. The synthesis of dream logic ("sleepwalking paths"), ancient magic, and a tangible craft feels fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
