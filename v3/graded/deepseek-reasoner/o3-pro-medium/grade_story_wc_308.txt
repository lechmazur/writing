<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ithar's weathered resolve is a consistent, embodied trait that drives the entire narrative. His final choice to etch instructions and relinquish power is a micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values (sharing over ruling), earning the Earned Stasis closure. The single flaw is a minor lack of visible internal contradiction during the high-pressure beat of tasting the arrowhead, which is more declarative than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant and held perfectly, with pressure building through sensory density and pattern recognition. Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the etched arrowhead waiting for a future pilgrim reweights the premise from personal mastery to cyclical teaching. The cost of relinquishment is legible in the act of etching and grounding the vision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The canyon setting is indispensable, actively constraining and enabling Ithar's method through its echoes and bone towers. The stone arrowhead functions as a micro-setting, charging the final image and constraining choice (e.g., its use to ground the vision). Sensory detail is masterfully selective and woven into action, reflecting the POV's goal-directed perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a flawless, single decisive intensification: the act of placing the arrowhead on his tongue. This agency-driven choice deepens his knowledge and directly leads to the climax of understanding. The cost of his devotion is tested by the canyon and paid through his act of sharing, which is a tangible forfeiture of power.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of navigation through stillness and cyclical teaching emerges entirely through concrete action and image, never stated. The final image of the etched arrowhead is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the prior material from a personal quest to a legacy. It embraces complexity, balancing power with the obligation of balance and sharing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature that filters the world through sound, memory, and vibration. The prose's lyrical, rhythmic control is exceptional and consistently voice-motivated, enhancing the accumulative texture. There is no head-hopping or register drift, even under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic variety. A single minor artifact occurs in the high-pressure beat: "tasting flint, river memory, and distant starlight" flirts with register elevation slightly beyond the POV's likely lexicon. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core concept of navigating without moving is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of mystical and physical navigation. The specific execution through echolocation and bird patterns feels organic and inevitable, not derivative. The risk-taking lyrical style fully commits to its premise and heightens stakes without becoming a gimmick.</comment>
