<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marrow's blank-faced performance and Ithica's painted smile create potent internal contradiction. Her final choice to accept the lamp's logic is earned by the dramatized shift from panic to calm under pressure. The moral ambiguity is embodied in her actions, not labeled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the internal hush is remade. The cost is legible in Ithica's transformed stance and the inspectors' eased shoulders. The turbine shutdown provides a coherent situational pressure that forces the final crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The farmhouse and turbines are not backdrop but active constraints, shaping the emotional and physical space. The cedar block and dried flowers are micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through a specific, grim POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of public grief vs. mandated happiness are signaled early. Escalation is driven by the inspector siren, forcing a panic that Marrow's agency resolves. The cost is the visible trade-off of accepting a manufactured lightness to survive, which reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of finding lightness within grief emerges through the specific image of the cedar lamp and the act of whittling. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The concept of a "remade hush" is the thematic core earned by the entire scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Ithica's perception. The prose has a distinct, controlled lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity. Marrow's dramatic narration is a clear voice distinction that serves the accumulative design. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and pattern-taught ("remade hush"). A minor deduction for a potential overload in the kettle narration line, which borders on decorative in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a dystopian happiness mandate with a lyrical, almost mystical performer feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is committed to fully and followed to its logical, emotionally complex conclusion. The specific choice of whittling a lightless lamp is a high-risk, high-reward inflection that pays off.</comment>
