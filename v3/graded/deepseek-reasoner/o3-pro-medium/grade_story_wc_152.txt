<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Selis's contradictory impulses (wisdom disguised as foolishness) are dramatized in her interaction with Voren, and her final choice to act is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Her internal state is embodied through tactile thread-work and selective perception under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost (the risk of her mission). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern breaks (Voren's intrusion) and a cadence shift (the decoded message) reweighting stakes. The final image of her moving out is reconfigured by prior particulars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory and candle constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Selis's expertise (e.g., "trembling threads," "shifting light"). The environment actively pressures tactics, such as the rotating roof enabling her listening.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens—Voren's intrusion deepens pressure, and her decoding forces a tactical leap. The cost is legible in the "last chance" urgency and the risk she undertakes, narrowing options decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (stitching as subversion, silence as weapon) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to secrecy vs. truth via the image of "wisdom traveled unseen." Complexity is embraced through Selis's layered deception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with elision (e.g., "adjacent possibilities") taught and paid off. POV is stable and voice-modulated (e.g., "galaxies bloomed like secrets"). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density and propulsion, but minor figurative strain in "galaxies bloomed like secrets" slightly muddles peak clarity. No loops or scaffolding; syntax varies purposefully with scene needs. Read-aloud rhythm is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of embroidery and espionage feels inevitable. Risk-taking (e.g., "adjacent possibilities" as method) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals, and the premise commits fully to its implications.</comment>
