<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's dual allegiance and orderly intuitive mind are established through concrete actions and micro-choices under pressure, driving her to steal the chip and later reorganize the community. Her final exhale and return to her role feel earned by prior causality, with the cost of her sustained tension legible. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously, as when she feels the chip's "authoritative" weight yet remains a "shadow taught manners." A minor deduction for some emotional states being labeled ("hopeful desperation") rather than fully embodied in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (public trust arrangement) with visible cost (her held breath since childhood) under a coherent causal lens. The foundation stone chip's theft and use directly cause the mayor's concession. The orientation is immediate, and the drive lens holds without ambiguity. The final image of the Ferris wheel turning reconfigures the stakes with a felt cost of enduring vigilance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The floating carnival setting is indispensable, constraining choices (vulnerable pier, loosened footbridge) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's professional perception ("read chaos like sheet music"). The environment is a tactical resource, such as using the calliope smoke to drown sensors. The micro-setting of the chip itself, smelling of "tidepools forgotten by architects," charges the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens: her plan with Tajo creates a diversion that enables the theft, which then forces the mayor's hand. The cost is legible in the postponed vote and the ongoing threat of corporate drones. The dominant stake (preserving the carnival's soul) tightens through each beat, culminating in a tangible victory with lasting consequences. The tension between immediate action and long-term strategy is palpable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between tradition and change, embodied in Mira's "dual lungs" metaphor. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the mosaic of shared stakes "sprayed in impossible colors," rejecting a tidy moral. Subtext operates in the graffiti's hidden messages and the polka-singing alarms. The integration of art and law as tools of resistance feels earned and complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that reads chaos like "sheet music" and maps rumors like "harbor pilots chart currents." The voice is confident and specific, with purposeful elision (e.g., the skylight pick is summarized). Dialogue is minimal but functional when present. The prose rhythm accelerates under pressure without losing coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid, with high information density and varied syntax. Most sentences advance story or atmosphere, though a few phrases ("hopeful desperation") lean slightly toward label-speak. The read-aloud rhythm is strong, with purposeful variation. Minor figurative stacking in high-pressure beats prevents a higher score, but clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a floating carnival, graffiti-coded revolution, and legal strategy feels fresh and inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. Risk-taking in structure (time jumps) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending's blend of poetic and pragmatic resolution is bold and coherent.</comment>
