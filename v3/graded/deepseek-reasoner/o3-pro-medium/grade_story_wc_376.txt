<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cressida's wilting-at-dishonesty trait is embodied and constrains choices, driving her retreat and later fearless movement. Her final unfurling posture and drenched state show earned change with visible cost. The relationship with Fen feels authentic and pressures truth-telling, though his introduction is slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of lost words/truth builds to a resonant reconfiguration where planting seeds reconfigures the city's reality. Closure lands on-page with cost (cracked clay, drenched state) and the final image of letters rising reweights prior material. The discovery under floorboards is a slightly soft setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, pressuring every choice through toxic sky and glass arches. The greenhouse city and oasis planter constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (bruise-purple sky, hissing humidity), fully integrated with action and POV bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. survival) escalate through accumulative density of unspoken words, culminating in the seed-planting act that forces a trade-off with visible cost (rain cleansing sky). Agency is clear in Cressida's decision to plant, driven by understanding dawned from the map. One meaningful tightening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of candor's power emerges organically from concrete particulars (seeds as unuttered truths, wilting trait). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of letters rising in rainbows. Resists moralizing; complexity lingers in the dead lily's memory watering the city.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a poetic perceptual signature ("city exhaled a brittle sigh"). Diction remains within character lexicon (gilded-leaf flourishes). Dialogue with Fen is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext of shared longing for truth. Minor rhythm issue in one complex sentence near end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and varied rhythm. One minor loop: "truth" appears densely in final beats but supports accumulative pattern. No figurative muddle; closure image remains clear. Sentence openings vary effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ecological and communicative decay feels fresh and inevitable. The conceit of an archive of unuttered truths is transformed through specific, grounded choices (seeds as pollen, wilting physiology). Risk-taking in poetic density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
