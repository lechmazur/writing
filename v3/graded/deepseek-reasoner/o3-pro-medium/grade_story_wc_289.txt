<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with micro-choices like blurring the letter revealing her hierarchy of values. Her final renunciation—releasing the secret—is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("lightness, as if every secret she had kept now breathed outside her ribs"). Contradictory impulses act in scene: her trade is secrecy, yet she seeks connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Mara's realization reconfigures her role with felt cost. The accumulative lens holds, building through sensory density and pattern breaks (e.g., the nest's whisper, the filament's hum). Orientation is immediate; cost is legible in the final image of the boat drifting and the "lightness" she feels.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The temple and installation function as micro-setting that constrains choice (e.g., stepping stones shaped like envelopes guide her path) and charge the final image (the nest reflected in the pond). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's professional bias ("weatherproof satchel," "tools of her odd trade").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: Mara actively follows clues (the nest's suggestion, the water's guidance) to the platform. The stakes tighten from personal secrecy to universal connection, with cost legible in her release of the letter. One meaningful deepening (the filament's mechanism) reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of connection versus secrecy through the image of the paper boat and the filament's hum. Theme emerges organically from events (the blurred letter, the communal music) without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., "Not everything that circles is lost").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends professional observation ("discreet love letter ghostwriter") with lyrical sensitivity ("prismatic quiet"). Purposeful compression (e.g., "follow the water") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains within Mara's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "lotus leaves waited like open palms"). Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; clarity is maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise of a love letter ghostwriter in a mystical art installation is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Emotional truth is prioritized through specific detail (the sailor's letter, the audio tapes). Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination feels organic and inevitable.</comment>
