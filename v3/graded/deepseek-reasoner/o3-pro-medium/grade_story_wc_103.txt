<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quillon’s retrocognitive flaw is embodied and constrains choices, his professional pride is tested, and his final renunciation is earned. A hairline slip: his motivation to "discover the texture of time" is slightly abstract, but the concrete cost of his choice solidifies it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis with undeniable cost ("forever designing pathways"). The hybrid (accumulative/causal) lens holds: pressure accumulates through sensory and geometric density, culminating in a causal choice to anchor the shard and accept his fate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is indispensable, constraining every choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("mist quivered," "ivy wrapped his ankles"), fully integrated with action and POV perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Quillon's agency under the hybrid lens. Each misstep in the hyperbolic maze multiplies corridors, raising the cost of his quest. The final choice to become the axis carries a severe, legible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of time, memory, and sacrifice. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The cost of preserving beauty is deeply felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a poetic, perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure. Syntax and rhythm masterfully reflect the protagonist's mental state and the story's dreamlike logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly inventive, but slight density issues emerge in high-pressure beats (e.g., "photographs developing in reverse"). A minor figurative overload slightly obscures immediacy without harming closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A stunningly original synthesis of concept, character, and setting. The premise of a hyperbolic garden encoding time is transformed through specific, grounded choices and a bold, coherent artistic vision that commits fully to its implications.</comment>
