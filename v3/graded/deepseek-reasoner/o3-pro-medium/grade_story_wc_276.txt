<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arlen's characterization is deeply integrated with his actions; his cool-headedness and emotional transliteration ability drive his choices, particularly the climactic release which costs him his rare catch but earns gratitude. His internal conflict between fisher hunger and empathy is embodied in the hesitation beat, making his final renunciation earned. The only minor flaw is slight diagnostic language in "transliterates emotions," though it's immediately grounded in concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Arlen releases the echo, reweighting his goal from capture to reverence, with cost legible in the "sigh that was more release than defeat." The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, escalating through pattern breaks and sensory density toward the decisive choice. All anchors are established early, and the constraint of Nethe's silence shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is indispensable, constraining choices (e.g., the zigzag pacing to read interference) and charging the final image with "gentle equilibrium." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Arlen's expertise, with tactile immediacy in lines like "hammered the rail spike... garden winced." The rail spike and wire-net function as micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Arlen's agency under the accumulative lens: his net-casting and spike-hammering intensify the silence, forcing the constellation's warning and his ultimate choice. The cost is unmistakable in the bruising hush and the ache of Nethe's hostage silence. The stake shifts from capture to understanding, deepened by the protagonist's actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central paradox of capturing silence, resolving in a non-literal answer: some songs refuse translation. The final image of the "compass humming toward distant, unspoken shores" reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like Nethe's shudder of gratitude, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Arlen's profession ("reading interference lines as a sailor reads wind"). Diction remains within his lexicon, and rhythmic control heightens pressure in peak beats. Purposeful compression (e.g., "speech only vibration-nets... could trap") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and varied syntax. Minor overwriting risks appear in phrases like "sorrow shaped as a shipwrecked cradle," which slightly stacks metaphors but does not harm clarity. No loops or scaffolds; momentum is maintained through concrete actions and images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound-garden mythology, emotional transliteration, and cosmic sleepwalking is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks like personified silence and constellation warnings heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise commits fully, transforming familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices in world and character.</comment>
