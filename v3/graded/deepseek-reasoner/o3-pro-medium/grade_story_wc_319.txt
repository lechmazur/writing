<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The guardian's motivation is clear and rooted in their role, compelling their choice to engage with the pendant. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, though the "dimensionally homesick" pang feels slightly abstract. The final choice to carry the garden inside is a credible endurance earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the guardian internalizes the garden and uncertainty, reconfiguring their role. The cost is legible in the final image of carrying the frozen garden within, foreclosing a simpler existence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The frozen garden is a masterfully integrated micro-setting that actively pressures the protagonist's choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered entirely through the guardian's unique perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres and deepens through the discovery of the pendant and interaction with the mist-shape. The dominant stake of finding belonging escalates meaningfully, culminating in a choice with visible cost—the guardian's internal reconfiguration to carry the garden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, particularly the spiral and the act of waiting. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of embracing uncertainty without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The guardian's voice is consistent and compelling, with purposeful compression and elision that serves the accumulative design. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a slight rhythm stumble occurs in "practiced interiorizing exteriors." No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of library fantasy and mystical realism. The core concept of "boundaries of light" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Bold risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
