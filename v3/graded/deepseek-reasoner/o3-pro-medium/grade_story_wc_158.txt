<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mareth's insomnia and poetic torment are embodied through concrete action ("refined her torment into ink"). Her decision to follow the postcard is a high-stakes micro-choice revealing a hierarchy of values, and the final blossom armistice is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("the war inside her cease, not in defeat but in shared breath").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, landing with felt cost ("the war inside her cease"). The elder's arrival via the postcard is a motivated ellipsis that pays off, though the mechanism of the elder's existence is slightly ambiguous, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image ("its spirals no longer echoing only brine"). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Mareth's poetic POV, with the environment evolving causally to support the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The dominant stake (transforming pain into finished beauty) tightens through the decision to plant the postcard, a meaningful deepening that reweights the stake with a visible, felt cost ("the war inside her cease").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of alchemizing pain into beauty emerges organically from events and images, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the blossoming, singing garden, which reweights prior material without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose's lyrical density is voice-motivated, pattern-taught, and legible, sustaining a consistent, character-specific way of noticing that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly poetic with excellent rhythmic control and information density. Minor deduction for a potential register drift in peak beats (e.g., "shyly unstoppable shimmer"), which, while voice-motivated, slightly risks clarity at the story's most crucial moment of action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of cosmic and deeply personal stakes. The combination of a galactic postcard, a giant shell, and a poetic alchemy of pain feels organic and singular, with bold risk-taking that heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
