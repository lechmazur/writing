<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amira's characterization is deeply embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., filing the gear by feel) revealing her hierarchy of values. The final choice to test the clock is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the shared silence. The practiced smile humanizes her quiet grief without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in "a screw of doubt turned free." The pattern of sensory substitution builds to a decisive cadence shift. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The water clock shop and birthing clamp function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Amira's professional POV. The fog evolves with the plot, thinning as internal clarity emerges.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with pressure intensifying through tactile discovery. The cost is felt in the sacrifice of the clock and the shared breathing at closure. One meaningful tightening (the screw's corrosion) forces a trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (e.g., "listening... was a way of smelling with her ears"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to perception and loss without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image, like the fog thinning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Amira's expertise. Diction remains within her lexicon, though minor filter verbs ("she felt") appear. Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops. Figurative language is pattern-taught and functional ("reading between lines"). A minor register drift occurs in "geography shift," but clarity is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of aromatherapy and clock repair feels organic and inevitable. Specific, grounded choices transform familiar tropes of loss. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative premise.</comment>
