<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("felt the old tension stitch itself into her shoulders like sutures"). Micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values. Final choice to go west together is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost ("hinge inside their ribs align"). Orientation is clear within first paragraph. Persistent constraint of broken trust shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Environment actively constrains choices and charges final image (snowfield for codes, mist sealing conspiracy). Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered ("muffling the world in a silver hush"). The pillbox functions as micro-setting that drives the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens through density increase (glyphs, gear revelation). Cost is legible in the physical and emotional price paid ("fingers red with cold"). Single meaningful tightening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reconciliation through repair emerges organically from concrete particulars. Ending offers resonant non-literal answer through the ticking mechanism. Minor thematic echo in final dialogue ("Unused courage waits...") prevents perfect score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with consistent POV filtration. Lyric compression is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Syntax and rhythm reflect Mara's precise, guarded nature. Dialogue is minimal but carries significant subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptionally high information density without padding. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful ("weighed exactly as much as everything broken"). Rhythm varies naturally with scene needs. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of spy thriller and literary reconciliation. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific, verifiable detail (pillbox, gear, snow codes) creates organic originality.</comment>
