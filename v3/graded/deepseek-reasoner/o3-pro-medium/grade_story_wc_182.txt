<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ora's characterization is concrete and particular, with her linguistic expertise and resourcefulness driving key choices under pressure. Her micro-choices, like using the diary and performing rescues, reveal a hierarchy of values. Marrow's paradoxical nature adds complexity without flattening her agency. The final choice to offer a lost word is earned by prior causality, though Marrow's motivation feels slightly underdeveloped, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (vault opening) with felt cost (sacrifice of an extinct word). The hybrid causal-accumulative lens holds, with events linking through because/therefore logic and textural density. Orientation is immediate and functional. The persistent constraint of the bookstore's rules shapes tactics throughout, and cost is legible in the final exchange.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. The labyrinthine bookstore pressures navigation and tactics, with shelves actively participating in rescues. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Ora's expertise. The environment evolves causally with events, such as the register's restoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens, with Ora's rescues and negotiations tightening options. The cost is unmistakable in the sacrifice of the lost word. Stakes are braided (finding the library vs. managing debts) and converge at closure. Pressure coheres and deepens through meaningful turns, like the register's demand.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, exploring memory, error, and redemption without moralizing. The final image of the library offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in gestures and implications, such as Marrow's dissonance approved by the shelves. The ending reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Ora's linguistic focus. Diction and syntax are controlled and purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity. The prose has a rich texture without obscuring clarity. Elision (e.g., the exact word spoken) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent and enhances sense without muddle. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Minor redundancy in descriptive stacks is outweighed by overall propulsion and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of ideas (time travel, linguistic magic, sentient architecture). Tropes are transformed through grounded choices in character and world. Emotional truth and human complexity are prioritized over surface novelty. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
