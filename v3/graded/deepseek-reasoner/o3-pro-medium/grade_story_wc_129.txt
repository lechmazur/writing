<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alyss's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion ("luminescent ache") and micro-choices (weaving reeds into the arbor) that reveal her values. Her trait of being "boldly sympathetic" drives the climax, and the final choice to graft herself onto community feels earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of "interlocked marsh reeds and charcoal pencils" reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the pattern of longing→discovery→action tightens coherently toward the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor constrain choices and charge the final image—Alyss weaves reeds into its lattice, and the environment actively shapes the climax. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("flakes of mirrored dust fell from its petals, ringing like teaspoons"), integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: the discovery of the arbor and Vire's symbol forces a choice to engage, with cost legible in the "resonant hum" and new obsidian shoots. The dominant stake (longing for community) tightens meaningfully through density increase and cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the grafting metaphor and the arbor's etched message ("Offer your thread..."), resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to community longing through the final image of interconnection, reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with consistent POV and purposeful elision (e.g., "beyond the murmur of lost languages"). Voice is poetic yet precise, and diction remains within Alyss's lexicon even at peaks. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High information density with zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught ("bottled rain," "luminescent ache"). Syntax accelerates with scene needs, and closure image is clear. No artifacts obscure causality or dull the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of organic and mineral imagery, with the arbor as a living conduit for kinship. Risk-taking in lyric prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight, grounded in specific detail.</comment>
