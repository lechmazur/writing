<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's reluctant yet resolute characterization is embodied through concrete micro-choices and interior contradiction. Her hidden vow and "offhandedly exact" competence feel earned, and her final renunciation of recognition ("that, she thinks, is proper") lands with visible cost. The emotional progression avoids diagnostic labeling, rooted in specific sensory details like the wind bending her shoulders.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred causal lens holds tightly: the nut's discovery triggers the dream, which compels the assembly, which forces the maze confrontation. Closure is a decisive change (maze reconfigured) with a resonant reconfiguration (Liora's role shifts from reluctant to resolved caretaker). Cost is legible in the frost's threat and her silent acceptance of anonymity. One minor causality question: the birds' shift from guarding travelers to confusing paths is stated but not fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining every choice. The labyrinth and mechanical birds apply direct pressure; the orchard's "tired" trees and oozing resin charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "smell of salt and rust," "tick like impatient hearts"). Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment evolves causally with the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (prevent lost souls) are signaled early and escalate through the frost's imminent threat. Agency is demonstrated through Liora's model assembly and maze navigation, forcing a trade-off (personal risk vs. collective safety). Pressure tightens causally under the lens, and cost is felt in the time constraint and physical danger. The closure forecloses the path of passive endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (quiet duty, the power of small things) emerges organically from the nut, the blueprint, and Liora's actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "the smallest husk" sheltering a map home. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, avoiding moralizing. The final reconfiguration charges prior particulars without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Liora's perception, with a distinct perceptual signature ("rows of twisted pear trees oozing amber resin"). Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure, becoming more urgent in the maze. Purposeful compression (e.g., the dream summary) is taught and pays off. No dialogue, so those elements are N/A.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence structure. Figurative language is precise and voice-motivated ("clings to the cliff like a bruise"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Minor deduction for a slight repetition in "leaving impressions without touching," but it serves a pattern and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of fantasy and mechanistic elements, transformed through specific, grounded choices. The concept of a disassembled blueprint guiding a labyrinth feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet, resilient protagonist and the integration of setting and object heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The closure image is singular and memorable.</comment>
