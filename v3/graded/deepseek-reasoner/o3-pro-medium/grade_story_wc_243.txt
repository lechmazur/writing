<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("haunted euphoria settle between ribs like a vigilant dove"). The archivist's final choice to write the note is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost, earned by prior causality. The widow, though brief, applies immediate pressure and her distinct voice ("Watch until the frame settles") charges the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: the archivist becomes the "sworn custodian," a role shift with the persistent constraint of always carrying the locket. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through symbolic density. A minor deduction for slight lens ambiguity early on, though it clarifies by the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "blooming jetty" and locket are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("smelling of earth and ghost orchards"). The environment subtly guides choice and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, culminating in the decisive act of writing the note. The cost is legible: the archivist's duty "burned through my fingertips," accepting a perpetual burden. The stake—preserving moments—transforms into active participation, a meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: renewal is a continuous, communal act. The locket's transformation and the final image of the "living archive" reweight prior material without moralizing. Complexity is embraced through the widow's "haunted euphoria."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure ("the tide inhaled"). Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off. The widow's dialogue carries subtext and advances the plot. POV is stable and voice is coherent, with diction matching the archivist's poetic, observant nature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("soot lifting like reversed rain"). Minor deduction for a slight register elevation in "vigilant dove," but it remains voice-motivated and does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise—a regenerated covenant through a changing photograph—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The combination of archivist, locket, and covenant feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
