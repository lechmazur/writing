<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (signing the cast, decrypting notes) revealing a clear hierarchy of values. The final choice to expose the betrayal is earned by the prior causality of discovering the ledger and the surgical alteration. A slight deduction for the seashell's shift from encouragement to warning, which feels more authorial than a dramatized internal realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong causal drive lens holds: discovery of identity → discovery of ledger → live broadcast. Closure is a decisive change (exposure and survival) with clear, felt cost (the loss of a former self, walking toward a new name). The engineer's hidden cables are a minor convenience but are set up by the child's involvement, preserving causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (sagging roof, corrugated gutters, glass atrium). The rusted library and neon cast function as micro-settings that pressure choices and supply key resources. Capped below 9.0 as the environment, while evocative, doesn't decisively constrain the final choice; the cables are the crucial constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens: each discovery narrows options toward the climactic broadcast. The dominant stake (survival/truth) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. The cost—the protagonist's entire known identity—is legible and immense, charging the final image of walking toward a new name.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of identity and transformative betrayal emerges organically from events. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the seashell whispering for anyone to listen and the protagonist choosing a new name. Resists moralizing, embracing complexity and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that filters the world through a stunt double's professional and emotional lens. The voice modulates effectively with pressure, from trembling fear to raw confession. Purposeful elision (e.g., the exact surgical process) is handled well, trusting the reader.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and vivid, specific imagery. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in "identity could be edited again," which feels slightly analytical for the peak of the crisis, though it is quickly grounded again.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise—a stunt double discovering he is a surgically altered replacement—is a fresh, specific synthesis of familiar tropes. The execution is bold and committed, following the premise's implications to a coherent and ingenious climax that heightens stakes without becoming a gimmick.</comment>
