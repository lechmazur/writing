<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirelle's characterization is precise and embodied, with micro-choices (using shears, speaking her name) revealing a clear hierarchy of values. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, though the "bodily poetic" trait operates more as a label than a constraining force in key beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural drive lens is taught early and holds, building through pattern breaks and cadence shifts. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands with undeniable conceptual cost on the page ("the city hum like a newborn chorus"). Orientation is immediate and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in purposeful, POV-filtered detail. The silver courtyard, loom-rooms, and prism sanctuary are not mere backdrops but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory selection is exquisite and reflects urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift (the sanctuary's unweaving) that reweights the dominant stake. The cost is legible in the courtiers' visceral reactions ("some wept, some laughed"). Protagonist agency drives the entire escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between conformity and authentic expression. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the "prismatic arcs," reweighting prior material without moralizing. The integration is flawless and complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature. The ornate, lyrical syntax is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative drive. A minor register drift occurs in the peak beat ("bodily poetic intent"), slightly distancing the POV at a crucial moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly polished with excellent rhythmic control. Figurative language is dense but coherent and purpose-driven. A single minor artifact exists: the phrase "bodily poetic" feels slightly label-like in its second use, creating a tiny loop that slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of courtesan, loom-rooms, and echo-harvest is strikingly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with bold risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. A singular artistic vision.</comment>
