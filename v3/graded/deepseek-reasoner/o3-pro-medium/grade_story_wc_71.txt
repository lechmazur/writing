<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in her method of reading histories through displaced objects. The final realization that the house is "mute, not lonely" is earned by her on-page actions and the cost of breaking the silence is felt. A minor deduction for the phrase "inadvertently profound," which veers toward diagnostic self-awareness but is quickly anchored in the action of speaking aloud.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; pressure builds through sensory density and pattern breaks (dust swirling, air thickening) culminating in the decisive change of the house "waking." Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost: the tremor echoing a heartbeat and warmth seeping from the walls. Causality is tight, with each action (placing the root, moving the swan, speaking) provoking a coherent response.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is a micro-environment that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The sea-green door, warm brass knob, and worn floor ruts are tactile, purposeful details filtered through Mara's perception. The "quiet bay in spring" and the cottage's interior are not just backdrop but the crucible for the action. The orris root and porcelain swan function as key objects that decisively shape the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a single, decisive intensification: the act of speaking the word "sanctify" breaks the pattern of silence and triggers the house's response. The dominant stake (understanding/awakening the house) is signaled early and paid off with a visible cost (the tremor, the released warmth). Agency is clear; her choices directly cause the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central action: displacement as illness, placement as cure. The final image of paint chips settling into "delicate scales" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of what makes a house feel alive. Subtext is rich in gesture and image (the descending wishbone, the closed door as "lungs"). Avoids moralizing, achieving profound thematic resonance through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied in a distinct perceptual signature ("the hour while the streetlights daydream"). The lyrical, precise prose is consistently voice-motivated and heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. Syntax and rhythm masterfully reflect the hushed, attentive quality of the narrative. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing momentum or clarity. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful ("silence stood like a cathedral pillar"). Sentence-level rhythm is varied and propulsive. Read-aloud quality is superb. A single, very minor instance of potential scaffold in "inadvertently profound" prevents a perfect score, but it does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core premise of a "normality noticer" who diagnoses houses through object displacement is highly original and fully committed to. The synthesis of the supernatural and the deeply tactile feels fresh and inevitable. The specific, verifiable detail (orris root, wishbone) avoids quirkiness, serving character and conflict. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
