<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Milo's motivation is clear and rooted in his unique connection to the dead. His internal conflict is embodied in the shift from his "forever cheerful diligence" to the moment his "whistle tangled on his tongue," showing a change under pressure. His final choice to return the chess king is a micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values—compassion over curiosity—with a visible, felt cost of his night's labor. The only minor flaw is a slight diagnostic lean in "petition the gardener," but it's quickly anchored in concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through density of imagery and pattern (whistle, tapestry, echoes) until a cadence shift at closure. The decisive change is Milo's act of returning the artifact, which reconfigures the cemetery's hush from "ache" to "lullaby." Cost is legible on the page in the "soil so recently turned it still sighs steam" and the weight of Rowan's "hidden regret." Causality is tight, with the found object leading inevitably to the revelation under the yew.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The cobalt silo's "corrugated walls drink lantern light," pressuring Milo's decoding work, while the cemetery's yew tree is the literal endpoint of the map. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Milo's profession: "dewy rows," "grainy scent of forgotten harvests." The silo and cemetery function as a crucible, with the environment mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: Milo chooses to dig, to decode, to return the artifact. The dominant stake (uncovering buried intentions) tightens through a single meaningful deepening—the vision-releasing decoding of the tapestry. Cost is felt in the "velveteen gloom... soft yet deafening" and the hours-or-centuries sacrifice. A minor deduction for the stake's abstract quality initially, but it becomes visceral through the specific vision of Rowan's regret.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tapestry's map of grief and the "uncharted echoes," resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: forgiveness can bloom when hidden intentions are uncovered, answered by the echoes' new "harmonies." Subtext operates in gesture and image, like the sovereign case tucked like a "metronome" against his heart. The core concept of unresolved memory is integrated through specific particulars rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature: the cemetery's hush leans "like an audience," and whispers are a "choir shaped of wind and calcium." Diction remains within Milo's lexicon, with rhythmic control that heightens pressure: "velvet dust," "month-old thunder." Purposeful compression ("Hours pass, or perhaps centuries") is taught early and pays off in the closure's temporal reweighting. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful, though a minor overload occurs in "velveteen gloom... soft yet deafening," which slightly muddles sense at peak pressure. Sentence-level rhythm varies effectively, accelerating during the decoding beat. No loops, scaffold, or redundancy. A small deduction for the one figurative muddle in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of cemetery gardener, supernatural whispers, and tapestry-map feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "uncharted echoes" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the decoding process and the cobalt silo setting. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final image of the completed map and harmonious echoes offers a bold, specific inflection that avoids median options.</comment>
