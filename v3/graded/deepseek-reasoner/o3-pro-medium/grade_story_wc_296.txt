<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inyara's motivation is clear and rooted in past failure, with embodied emotion ("ached behind her ribs"). Micro-choices like speaking to the apples reveal values under pressure. The final unbending is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the memory wracking her.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strong; closure is a decisive change with cost legible when "water rushed out, carrying the confession." Orientation is anchored early; the frozen confession payoff transforms tactics and reweights the ending.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (mirror blocks pod, apples with thorns) and charges the final image (orchard whirls escorting her). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, like "skeins of mist twisted into branches."</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is agency-driven under causal lens: negotiating with apples, thawing the mirror. Cost is felt when memory wracks her and ice collapses. One meaningful tightening (mirror confrontation) forecloses guilt path.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and redemption emerges through particulars (sister's laughter, ash scent) without moralizing. Ending offers a resonant non-literal answer with the vision of her sister alive, reweighting prior loss.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("warlike serenity of dawn"). Lyrical compression is taught and paid off; no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent under pressure.</comment>  
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with varied rhythm and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language serves pressure ("like a surrendering sword"). Minor complexity in peak metaphors doesn't obscure closure.</comment>  
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of frozen confession and flesh-eating seed feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity in detail (runic thorns, ivory pod) avoids derivativeness.</comment>
