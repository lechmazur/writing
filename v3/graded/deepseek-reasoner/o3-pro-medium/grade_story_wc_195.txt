<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Caron's internal contradiction between war-weary knight and hopeful poet is embodied throughout, with micro-choices like reciting the script and surrendering his titles earning his transformation. The final renunciation of fear is motivated by prior causality and carries visible cost in his tears and limp.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: closure is a Conceptual Repricing where naming the orchard "Possibility" reweights the premise with undeniable cost (tears, physical limp). Orientation is clear by line 4; the pattern of "unsnapping" and theatrical motifs tightens toward the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains choice (labyrinth vines force pathfinding) and charges the final image (vines blossom into dawn). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Caron's perception (e.g., "glass that never saw sunrise").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Caron's agency: improvising the duel internally when script fails, then surrendering fear to name the orchard. Cost is legible in his physical and emotional state ("tears he had long forgotten how to shed").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the marionette theater and "unsnapping" motifs culminate in a non-literal answer to possibility vs. constraint. No moralizing; the final image of gathering pages as snow resonates without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with consistent lyrical density ("sap-slowed leaves reflecting distant constellations"). POV is stable; elision (e.g., the missing page) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language ("petals folding like secret syllables"). No loops or scaffold; syntax accelerates with pressure ("Caron exhaled, letting wars, titles, and loneliness unsnap"). Minor risk of density in peak beats but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of knightly quest and metaphysical theater transforms tropes through specific imagery. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
