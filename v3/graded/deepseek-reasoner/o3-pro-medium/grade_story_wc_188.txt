<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cyril's interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses ("serious playfulness") acting simultaneously. His motivation intensifies under pressure, compelling higher-stakes choices like improvising the firework. The final choice to scatter cinders with the princess feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the inverted despair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure is a decisive Conceptual Repricing where despair is inverted into festival. The cost is legible in the final image of "new constellations perforating hopeless paper." Linkage is tight, with each beat (chant, mosaic, rag knot) accumulating density to reweight the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "blooming fortress" and "mosaic" actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through Cyril's professional POV. The environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, as seen in "petals of night-bloom roses like silent audiences."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Cyril's agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful cadence shift when the guard shouts the mosaic phrase. The cost is unmistakable: the inversion of scheduled despair into rebellion. Pressure coheres through patterned intensification, narrowing options until the decisive act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to hopelessness via "new constellations perforating hopeless paper." Subtext operates in implication, such as the mosaic's hidden command, resisting tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Cyril's voice modulates with emotional intensity, and his professional lexicon ("compressed chrysanthemums of colored powder") remains consistent. Purposeful elision (e.g., the transition to the observatory) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deduction for occasional dense phrasing ("centrifugal force wring out flammable mist") that slightly obscures immediacy. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of rebellion and artistry feels inevitable. The core premise offers a fresh angle on defiance, transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure effect remains legible.</comment>
