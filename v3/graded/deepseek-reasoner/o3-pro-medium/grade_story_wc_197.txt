<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lina's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion ("felt each deletion like a skin bruise") and micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. Her final transformation is earned by prior causality, fusing memory with flesh in a decisive change with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds strongly. Closure is a decisive change (becoming a vessel for lost stories) with undeniable cost ("memory fused with flesh"). Orientation is immediate; the puddle-map discovery and lagoon climax are tightly linked and land with resonant force.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purpose-driven, constraining choices (key unlocks kiosk) and charging the final image (lagoon brightens, apparitions step onto water). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lina's perception, enhancing atmosphere without slowing momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving dissent) escalate through Lina's agency under pressure (slipping away, using key, wading to kiosk). Security arrival tightens options, forcing the fusion climax. Cost is legible in the light coiling around her ribs and the city's reawakening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus indifference emerges organically through concrete actions and images (revised histories, puddle-map, lagoon). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lina's transformation, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("amber glow sketched rippling constellations"). Prose reflects Lina's quiet resolve, and elision (e.g., trolley ride) is purposeful. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, though occasional metaphors ("water skins") slightly strain clarity. No loops or scaffolds; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor figurative overload in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magical realism and political resistance feels fresh and inevitable. The puddle-map and phone booth key are transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
