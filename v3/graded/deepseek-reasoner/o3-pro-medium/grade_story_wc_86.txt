<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("thumb circling the drawer pull as talisman"). Her final choice to untether Ilren is earned by prior causality and her stated philosophy. The micro-choice to give him the drawer pull reveals her hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara lingers on the parapet, feeling past mistakes loosen. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density and symbolic weight. The cost is legible in the final image of her carrying the "tide-stained quiet."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail that pressures choice. The storm-worn parapet and mist charge the final image. The drawer pull, a micro-setting object, constrains choice and is reweighted at closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens. Mara's decision to untether Ilren is a meaningful tightening that narrows options and tests her theory. The cost is felt in the captains' hesitation and the palpable moment "suspended like dew before falling."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, particularly the drawer pull and the "space between apology and forgiveness." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of Mara threading the twine, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mara's professional, metaphorical worldview. The voice is consistently textured and controlled under pressure. Purposeful elision (e.g., the gale stealing syllables) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and concise, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor deductions for occasional dense phrasing ("storm-worn windblown parapet in mist" feels slightly overstacked) and a near-paraphrase loop describing the hush. No artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a prisoner exchange with a thematic focus on reconciliation feels fresh and inevitable. The antique drawer pull is a highly original, specific inflection that transforms a familiar trope. The story commits fully to its premise and follows its implications with bold risk-taking.</comment>
