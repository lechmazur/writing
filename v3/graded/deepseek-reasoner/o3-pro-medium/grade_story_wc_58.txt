<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Peregrine's motive to understand "the geography of healing" through Selene's "unhealed map" is a sophisticated, character-particular drive that intensifies under pressure. Selene's contradictory impulses—wishing to be seen entire yet communicating through projected presence—are dramatized in scene, not summarized. Their final exchange ("an obituary for the living is a compass, not a tombstone") earns its wisdom through prior causality, with the cost of her impending vanishing felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout: pressure builds through density of image and pattern (obituaries, threads, maps) culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on the page with cost ("leaving only the thread warm against my wrist"). One slight causality question: the mechanics of "projecting presence" are somewhat nebulous, but the emotional cost remains legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The shadowed garden and the carpet thread function as micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The thread is handled, gifted, and becomes a tactile link to Selene's pulse. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("frost-stiff rose," "dry leaves across marble sounding like distant applause"), filtered through Peregrine's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift and density increase that reweights the dominant stake (being remembered before vanishing). The princess's intimate request and subsequent corrections ("sorrow must border hope the way cliffs border sea") deepen the emotional pressure, forcing Peregrine's compositional choices. The cost of their shared, frost-filmed vigil is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "explained absences" and the action of mapping inner geographies. The final image—the compass metaphor—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how words can heal. It reweights the premise without moralizing, embracing complexity and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, writerly voice that modulates under pressure ("my notebook filling with vividly descriptive phrases that rose like lanterns"). The dialogue is sparse but potent, carrying significant subtext and goal pursuit. The elision around "projecting presence" is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. There is high information density without scaffolding or loops. One minor instance of potential register drift ("lonesome splendor" feels slightly elevated for Peregrine's internal lexicon) but it is character-assigned and does not harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The premise of writing living obituaries in a realm where disappearance is currency is strikingly original and fully committed to. The synthesis of obituaries, cartography, and metaphysical projection feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking with a quiet, accumulative structure heightens the stakes and meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
