<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysander's internal contradiction between anxious elation and resolve is embodied in his physical communion with plants. His final choice to inscribe the spiral is earned by prior causality of his scar-based connection, with visible cost in blood and sap mingling. The "root-bound visionary" epithet is fully dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly: his actions directly trigger the maze's reconfiguration. Closure is a decisive change with clear cost—blood/sap mingling, ground tremoring, scars sealing—legible in the final beats. The eclipsed covenant backstory is efficiently integrated and pays off in the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cobalt glade and maze clipping are micro-settings that actively constrain and charge the final choice. Sensory details like "petrichor and tungsten-tinged light" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lysander's expertise. The glade's transformation into a spiral path is the climax's physical manifestation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency: Lysander's decision to cut his arm tightens options and forces the covenant's renegotiation. Cost is unmistakable in the bloodletting and physical tremor. The dominant stake (releasing trapped souls) is tested concretely through sympathetic wounding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the spiral's reconfiguration of constraint into guidance. The final image of the "newborn path" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to renegotiation without moralizing. Subtext operates in the plants' whispered commands and the stained fingertips.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature ("roots like distant thunder"). Diction remains within Lysander's lexicon of botanical mysticism. Purposeful compression in phrases like "future arrives early" is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language ("veins on his palms glowed, answering chlorophyll filaments") is coherent and voice-motivated. No loops or scaffold artifacts; closure beats are clear and vivid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of botanical magic and metaphysical covenant feels inevitable. The scar-based communion mechanic is highly specific and irreplaceable. Risk-taking in the visceral climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming the trope of self-sacrifice.</comment>
