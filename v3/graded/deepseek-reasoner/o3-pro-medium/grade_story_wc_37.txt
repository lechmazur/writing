<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion under pressure. The final choice to tear the logbook arises from contradictory impulses—order versus chaos—and is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The guide's presence applies secondary pressure, forcing a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern break (tearing logbook) reweights the stake with cost. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where memory-keeping is redefined from cataloging to nurturing. Cost is legible in the final image of "shared memory weaving inside my veins." The mirror world reveal transforms prior material without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (mica window bound by vines) and charges the final image (fractured pane revealing true sky). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias. The greenhouse functions as micro-setting, altering tactics and evolving causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: the decision to tear the logbook forces a trade-off (order for chaos) with visible cost. Pressure coheres through density increase (voices layering) that reweights the dominant stake. The final image carries felt cost in the "aching yet joyful" tone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images (logbook pages blossoming into chorus) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to memory's purpose through the final image of swaddling memories "until they could fly." Subtext operates in implication (woven dawns as communal creation).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Purposeful compression ("sap ran like mercury") is taught early and pays off. Diction remains within POV's lexicon even under pressure. Dialogue is absent, but internal voice coherence is exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, but slight figurative density in peak beats ("light dripped through, not blinding gold but woven dawns") risks mild register elevation. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with closure clarity untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory, light, and community feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals (fermented fireflies, mica window). Transformation of tropes (orchard as memory vault) is grounded in character choice.</comment>
