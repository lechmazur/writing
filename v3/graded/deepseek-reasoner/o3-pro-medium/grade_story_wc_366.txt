<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ellis’s reticence is embodied through action ("speaking mostly through the trims of his wake") and his final, contained swell of speech is a credible, earned shift. His micro-choices (pocketing the pebble, naming the shard) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The sole deduction is for a slightly compressed motivation for his initial dread, which feels more declared than fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Ellis transitions from solitary skipper to conscious guardian in a "quiet network," with cost felt in his savored "anchored hush." The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, escalating through pattern density (cairn, glass, lamp) to a cadence shift that reweights the stake. The final image reconfigures his role and the world's rules with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in economy and pressure. The lantern room ("smelled of paraffin, salt, and a faint lavender of age") and the sea glass are micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and deeply filtered through Ellis's professional, tactile POV, making the environment a crucible rather than a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive intensification: the dark lamp, the cryptic cairn, and the pulsing glass deepen the mystery and narrow options to a single, ritualistic act. Ellis's agency in replying to the cairn and naming the shard forces a trade-off (his silence) and reweights the dominant stake of safety with a visible, felt cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of cairns, glass, and light—a "quiet network of guardians" protecting against existential dread. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the "greenened promise," reweighting prior material without moralizing. The complexity of safety as both a bottled feeling and a collective act is earned through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a percussive, maritime rhythm ("The tide rolled ink-black") and a perceptual signature deeply tied to Ellis's worldview. Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., the keepers' backstory) are taught and paid off. The prose remains coherent and legible under peak pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly efficient, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("an uninvited dread that glimmered like static"). A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "like breath inside someone else's lungs" risks mild coherence strain), but overall, rhythm and syntax expertly modulate with scene needs, and there are no loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lighthouse haunt, a stone-cairn code, and a sea-glass chain letter feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic, committing fully to its premise. The unconventional, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry, supporting a singular artistic stance.</comment>
