<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ilya's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling his high-stakes choice to use the eye. His internal conflict is embodied and concrete, particularly in the confession about his sister. The final choice to collaborate with Mara is a meaningful change earned by prior causality, with the visible cost of risking the council's wrath. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label-speak in "confession reflex," though it is quickly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (plan to disseminate knowledge) with a clear, felt cost (the risk of the council). The causal lens holds strongly: Ilya's search leads to the discovery, which forces the confession, which enables the new plan. The orientation is immediate and the linkage is tight. The cost is legible in Mara's warning and Ilya's copper taste.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The hanging orchard is not merely descriptive; it actively constrains Ilya's search and supplies the key object. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through his professional perspective (e.g., "fungal humps," "copper probe"). The environment evolves with the weather, affecting action and mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: Ilya's deliberate search leads to the discovery, which forces the painful confession, which in turn enables the new collaborative plan. The stakes (psychological safety) are signaled early and tested concretely. The cost is legible in the risk taken with Mara and the council's potential reaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of truth vs. kindness emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the plan to "distill the eye's lesson into recipe, not relic." The final image of the orchard's discord feeling "woven into a larger, forgiving chord" provides thematic resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The voice is consistent and character-specific, with syntax and diction reflecting Ilya's rational mind. The elision of the virus's origin is purposeful and paid off by its ongoing effects. Dialogue with Mara is natural, goal-driven, and carries distinct subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and variation. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "truth now spilled from throats like uninvited wine"). Minor deduction for a slight register drift in "psychological safety" and "confession reflex," which feel slightly diagnostic, though they are quickly anchored in concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of a post-truth world and a mystical relic. The combination feels organic and is executed with high conceptual integrity. The emotional truth and human complexity are specific and avoid generic templates. The risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
