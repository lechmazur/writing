<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Corvin's motivation is clear and consistent, driving his ascent and debate with Mara. His internal conflict between data and narrative is embodied in micro-choices, like hesitating after Mara's counterargument. The final collaborative stance is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in his trembled calm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strong: Corvin's thesis directly motivates his ascent and encounter with Mara, leading to a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where they agree to collaborate. Orientation is immediate; cost is legible in the "abrasive calm inside him trembled" and the shared descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (low tide timing, submerged museum) and charging the final image (star charts on sediment-coated glass). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like "algae-filtered dusk" and "lotus sprouting from shattered figureheads," filtered through Corvin's philosophical bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. narrative) escalates through the debate with Mara, forcing Corvin to doubt and then adapt his method. Agency is clear in his decision to invite her to descend, narrowing options. Cost is felt in his trembled calm and the physical risk of the descent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the conflict and resolution, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer—star charts as a verifiable narrative—reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gestures like the lagoon stilling, signaling tension without exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature favoring philosophical abstraction ("stratified truth"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with distinct voices: Corvin's clipped syllables vs. Mara's narrative focus. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and no artifacts. Figurative language ("rumor became the only map") is purposeful and consistent. Information density is high, advancing story and atmosphere without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic and philosophical themes, with specific details like the chronometer cog and sedimentary layers. Risk-taking in style (lyric compression) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
