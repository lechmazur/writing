<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Briony's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in meticulous observation yet open to folklore's wisdom. Her final choice to accept the seed's vision feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her altered role. Embodied emotion ("felt the tender weight of destiny settle like warm moss") avoids diagnostic speech. Minor deduction for slight summary in middle reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly; the silver leaf's message directly propels action to the arbor's heart. Closure is a decisive change (accepting the seed's vision) with felt cost (new responsibility). Orientation is immediate; the verse invitation tightens options convincingly. Persistent constraint of folklore vs. science shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (skyborne arbor limits access) and charging the final image (emerald transformation). Sensory detail is purposeful ("pollen that chimed like bells"). Micro-setting (moonstone specks) evolves tactically. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under causal lens: Briony's decision to follow the leaf narrows options to the arbor's heart. Cost is legible in her altered role and the valley's changed perception. Dominant stake (decoding messages) tightens meaningfully through the silver leaf's prophecy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through integration of science and folklore, resolved in the final image of transformed monuments. No moralizing; the ending reweights prior material ("every rustle above her spoke in mossy delight"). Subtext operates through imagery (monuments, seeds). Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with lyrical yet controlled prose ("ashen skyborne arbor hung like upturned roots"). POV is stable and deep; free indirect style blends observation with character bias. No head-hopping. Diction remains within Briony's plausible lexicon despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("patient as lichen"). Minor deduction for slight synonym churn ("mossy delight" repeated). Rhythm varies effectively; sentences accelerate during discovery beats. No clarity issues at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of botanical precision and mystical folklore feels inevitable. Risk-taking in worldbuilding (skyborne arbor) heightens stakes. Premise is transformed through specific details (moonstone specks, ritual monuments). No derivative echoes; emotional truth anchors novelty.</comment>
