<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hilara's characterization is precise and embodied, with her meticulous nature ("monkish rigor") and curiosity driving every choice. Her internal conflict between solitude and integrity is dramatized through micro-choices like transmitting codes despite fear. The final choice to collaborate with Coren is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in her risked safety.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly: the message tube directly triggers her investigation, and her choices narrow options toward the climactic gate opening. Closure is a decisive change (mutual survival achieved) with felt cost in her breached isolation. Orientation is immediate; all anchors are set within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposefully integrated—storm imagery permeates every description, and the western industrial belt constrains her route. The greenhouse and broken test tube chimes charge the final image. Minor deduction: the quiet courtyard setting, while atmospheric, doesn't actively pressure choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start (repressed truth vs. safety) and escalate through her journey westward. Pressure tightens causally: the precise coordinates force her into forbidden territory, and the need for codes creates a final, risky choice. Cost is legible in her transmission under implied surveillance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the conflict between recorded truth and lived integrity. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "honest weather" as mutual survival, achieved through collaboration. Subtext operates in gestures like sharing silent tea, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Hilara's professional perception (e.g., "barometric paper" voice simile). Voice is distinct and consistent, with rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven when it appears.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and varied syntax. Minor figurative overreach in "thunder rolled like marble across cathedral floors" slightly strains the established voice. Otherwise, no artifacts or loops; momentum is well-maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of climate sci-fi and bureaucratic repression feels fresh and specific. The storm recorder and exiled meteorologist roles are transformed through grounded choices, not tropes. The core concept of a rogue quarantine zone drives the plot and stakes irreplaceably.</comment>
