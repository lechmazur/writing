<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lenore's grief is embodied and specific, driving micro-choices like inking the stencil and folding swans. Her final transformation into the observatory is earned by prior causality. The only minor flaw is a slight diagnostic tinge in "unspent grief," but it's immediately grounded in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lenore becomes the observatory, with cost legible in her tears and the dawn's arrival. The vellum stencil and origami swans build pattern density that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The observatory constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are purposefully selective (e.g., "bronze dome yawned," "pale lamplight"). The micro-setting of the workbench and tools actively shapes Lenore's tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lenore's agency under the accumulative lens. The dominant stake (transmuting grief) tightens through her actions with the stencil and lockets. Cost is visible in the blood welling and the changed city below.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like lockets and origami swans. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "teach withering to bloom" without moralizing. The final image of hammered absence is profoundly earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature. Purposeful compression ("things don't have to run forward to move us forward") serves closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density. Minor figurative strain in "curtains of intention" slightly muddles peak clarity, but doesn't harm closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of celestial navigation and grief work feels inevitable. Risk-taking with symbolic elements (tattoos, lockets) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The "genuinely artificial" star concept is brilliantly particular.</comment>
