<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's urbane serenity and tremor of purpose are embodied and specific, driving his micro-choices. His final act of offering the puppets is an earned renunciation, though the visible cost of this endurance is slightly muted, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the dome's reversed echoes force the scholars to reconfigure their certainties. The cost is legible in their chastened state and the "cautious dawn" of their epiphanies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (e.g., "moths drifted like ash"). The radar dome and candle are micro-settings that charge the final image, though the dome's potential to constrain choice is not fully exploited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Silas's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving through bars to test his method. The cost is felt in the audience's "sting of complicity," though the final confrontation lacks the same visceral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges impeccably from action and image, culminating in Silas's final, non-moralizing statement. The concept of "lukewarm light" offers a resonant, complex answer to the central ethical question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature. The lyrical, precise prose ("meteor hush," "paling sky") is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high density and rhythmic control. A minor tendency toward dense figurative language in high-pressure beats ("half-lit epiphanies flickered") prevents a perfect score, but clarity is never harmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a calligrapher-puppeteer using a mythic story stick to perform ethical reversals is highly original and feels inevitable. The concept is fully committed to and executed with specificity and risk.</comment>
