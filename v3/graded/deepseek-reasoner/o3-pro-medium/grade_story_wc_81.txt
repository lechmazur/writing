<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maris's motivation is clear and rooted in her specific, established traits as a logical indexer. Her "tranquilly perceptive" nature is not a label but a demonstrated skill, shown through her echo-mapping and tactile verification of the codex. Her final choice to stamp the forgery is a high-stakes decision earned by prior causality, with a visible cost—the loss of the library. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on diagnostic language in the final paragraph ("the alternative hypothesis of courage").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A strong causal drive lens is established and held: her investigation leads to discovery, which forces a choice with irreversible consequences. The closure is a decisive change: she verifies the forgery and escapes with proof, forever altering her relationship to the library. The cost is legible on the page in the roaring torrents and collapsed shelves, sealing her path of return. The structure is tight, with a single meaningful tightening from discovery to flood.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sunken library is not a postcard setting but a crucible that actively pressures choices through absolute darkness, salt breezes, and finally, surging water. The environment constrains her actions and charges the final image of her wading through the flooded atrium. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional priorities (e.g., feeling ink depths, noticing seven dialects). The setting's evolution is causal and integral to the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake (verifying textual truth) is signaled early and escalates coherently under the causal lens. The discovery of the hidden passage is a meaningful tightening that narrows her options and raises the physical stakes. Her agency drives the escalation—her choice to remove the codex triggers the flood. The cost is unmistakable: the library is lost, but the chain of provenance is salvaged at great personal cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of character, setting, and action—the pursuit of truth in a drowned world of lies. The concepts of "reclaimed stillness" and "honest origins" are earned through Maris's specific struggle and final, costly act. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the "first honest dawn" preparing to open its pages, reweighting the entire narrative without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply embedded in Maris's perceptive, logical consciousness. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with pressure without losing coherence ("dappled through each doubt like moonlit surf"). Purposeful compression (e.g., "whispering of tides beyond calendars") is taught and pays off, enriching the atmosphere. The voice remains consistent and character-specific throughout the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is purposeful and cohesive, supporting the atmosphere without muddying clarity. A single instance of potential scaffold exists in the phrase "Reclaimed, because truth steadies the sea of voices; stillness, because silence can finally breathe between honest words," which slightly explains a previously shown concept.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sunken library, a logical page indexer, and an antique ink stamp feels fresh and inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic, avoiding cliché. The risk of a quiet, intellectual protagonist in a high-concept setting pays off through impeccable execution, heightening the stakes and coherence. The closure image is wholly original and memorable.</comment>
