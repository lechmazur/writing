<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marlo's resolute scavenger identity drives micro-choices (collecting fragments, releasing sounds) with embodied contradiction—regret versus action. His final choice to carry rather than steal stories is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the relinquished fragments. The ghost's hollow cavity physicalizes internal conflict without diagnostic labeling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of collecting/releasing fragments escalates to closure where Marlo's traded stories reconfigure his relationship with regret. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost legible in "shared memory" and the ghost's transformed state. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Kinetic lagoon and carousel horses constrain choices (memory-erasing lily pads, compass-eyed horses). The disposable camera wheel charges the final image with "shared memory." Sensory detail is purposefully selective, reflecting Marlo's professional bias ("overheard stories drift like gulls").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marlo's agency under accumulative lens: collecting fragments intensifies pressure until he must relinquish them to fill the ghost's cavity. Cost is unmistakable in the traded sounds and the reconfiguration of his purpose. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of carrying vs. stealing stories emerges through concrete action (releasing giggles, sighs, curses) rather than statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the compass pointing toward "paths yet to erode." Minor risk of thematic echo in ghost's final promise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled compression ("fractured stillness," "chronologically confused"). POV is stable and voice-motivated; elision (e.g., ghost's origin) is taught and paid off. Diction remains within Marlo's lexicon even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("time has snagged on eddies"). Minor register drift in ghost's dialogue ("unfinished exposures") but does not obscure closure. Rhythm accelerates with pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of scavenging and metaphysical negotiation. Premise transforms tropes through specific details (camera wheel, kinetic lagoon). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
