<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amelia's characterization is precise and earned. Her "oldest vice" of curiosity and "devotedly observant" nature compel her choices under pressure. The final decision to intervene is rooted in her consistent traits and the proof-by-contradiction logic, with visible cost in the sale of her estate. Her internal conflict between loyalty and truth is embodied, not summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly: the telephone call motivates the ascent, the orrery reveals the stakes, and the proof-by-contradiction logic forces the climax. Closure is a decisive change (publishing the truth) with felt cost (financial loss, reputational risk). The final image of the stars "taking dictation" charges the ending with resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The observatory is indispensable, pressuring choice through its echoing acoustics and open dome. The orrery constrains the final choice, and the pen nib screeching in the groove is a tactile, consequential action. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Amelia's editorial perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to institutional accountability. The orrery's revelation tightens the conflict, forcing a choice between legacy and truth. The cost is legible in Amelia's vow to sell her estate and face the consequences. Agency is decisive and earned under causal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between legacy and truth. The "orbits of regret" concept is transformed into a tangible mechanism for change. The final image of "rewritten universe" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the orrery and the pen's screech.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, editorial voice. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, with Felix's "reverent yet mischievous" tone contrasting Amelia's composure. The prose has a distinct rhythmic control, though a minor register drift occurs in "theorem finally balance."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("planets revolving in choreographed orbits of regret") slightly dulls immediacy. The pen nib's "screech" is a powerful, concrete image. Rhythm and syntax are generally well-controlled and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a newsprint heiress, a brass orrery of headlines, and an observatory setting is fresh and inevitable. The "proof by contradiction" logic is a non-obvious, ingenious turn that heightens stakes. The story commits fully to its premise, achieving a singular artistic stance without derivative echoes.</comment>
