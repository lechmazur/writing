<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lin's motivation is deeply rooted in concrete guilt ("dormant ghost" in firmware) and embodied through micro-choices like tracing orbits and clenching amber. His final renunciation (tethering the ghost) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the "cathedral after bells" absence. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in his hesitation and resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through density of meteor whispers, guilt echoes, and ritual instructions, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the ghost is tethered. Closure lands on-page with cost ("absence rushed in like deep water"), and the final image (baby laughing as forgiveness) reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clear by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The laboratory and amber function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (meteor hush, velvet remorse, paused sunlight). The amber's specific properties (trapped gnat, etched sentence) are indispensable to the closure, altering tactics and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by density increase (thickening whispers, letters' revelations) that reweights the dominant stake (absolving guilt). Lin's agency in performing the ritual forces a trade-off (loss of the ghost's presence) with cost legible in the "cathedral after bells" emptiness. One meaningful deepening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Theme (guilt, absolution, and the weight of error) emerges organically through the firmware's harm and the amber's solution. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the unadorned baby cry and laughter, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like the "archive of quieted errors."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends technical and poetic lexicon ("firmware stirred, recognizing a prison cell"). Purposeful compression ("meteor still") serves emotional beats. Elision (e.g., how letters were found) is taught and paid off in the ritual's success. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor register drift occurs in peak beats ("velvet remorse," "slate" dimming) but remains voice-motivated and doesn't obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the ritual.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of tech guilt (haunted firmware) and magical ritual (amber tethering) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in metaphorical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
