<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-specific, with embodied emotion ("water folding around my chest with surprising warmth"). The final choice to copy the ledgers is earned by prior causality and reveals a clear hierarchy of values with visible cost ("risk, but the canal itself had taught me that silence corrodes more than confession").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds strongly. Closure is a decisive change (becoming "part of the legend") with clear, felt cost ("risk") and a persistent constraint (the watchers, the company reborn) shaping the final tactical choice. Orientation is immediate and precise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The canal setting is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and supplies resources (the strongbox, the ring). The sundial and the strongbox are recurring objects that constrain choice and decisively charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: the discovery of the strongbox and its contents directly forces the high-stakes choice to copy the ledgers. The cost of that choice is legible on the page ("risk"). The dominant stake (uncovering truth) is signaled early and meaningfully tightens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus silence emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: "silence corrodes more than confession." The final image of the water mirroring sky and boat offers a complex conceptual repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and impeccable rhythmic control under pressure. POV is stable and apt, with a consistent, evocative voice. The elision of the company man's exact thoughts is purposeful and effective, maintaining subtext and tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional prose with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("mist retreated like a defeated negotiator"). Syntax and rhythm are masterfully controlled to accelerate and breathe with scene needs. Read-aloud quality is superb.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of legend-seeking and moral reckoning. The concept of a sundial reading intentions is highly original and fully integrated. The story commits to its premise and follows its implications with authenticity and boldness.</comment>
