<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ilya's motivation is clear and rooted in his moonstruck nature, intensifying under pressure. His final choice to surrender his own creative spark is a meaningful, earned renunciation with visible cost ("lighter and emptied"). Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The only minor flaw is a slight over-reliance on poetic abstraction in peak emotional beats, but this does not break the closure choice's motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that lands on the page with undeniable cost ("a bell rung clear of clapper"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory density and pattern breaks. The final image reconfigures meaning, and a persistent constraint (the unwritten calendar) shapes tactics. Orientation is anchored immediately with who, where, and when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway and astronomical instrument function as micro-settings that actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through Ilya's specific POV. The environment subtly guides choice and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with pressure building through his nightly wanderings and the final costly sacrifice. The dominant stake (freeing creativity) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. The cost is legible on the page in the climax. A minor deduction for the comet's arrival feeling slightly coincidental, though it complicates rather than resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central thematic question of sacrifice for creativity. Theme emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The final image of Ilya resting, content to dream in silence, provides a profound conceptual repricing of the liberator's role without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and effective with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose has a distinct texture in word choice and syntax that reflects Ilya's dreamer state. Purposeful compression and lyrical diction are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush but generally controlled, with high information density and clear propulsion. Read-aloud rhythm is strong. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("Those silent syllables pressed against his skull like moth wings") creates occasional mild opacity, but doesn't harm closure clarity. No loops or scaffold artifacts are present.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of astronomical pursuit and creative liberation feels fresh and non-obvious, made specific through grounded particulars. The core premise offers a transformative angle on familiar tropes. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
