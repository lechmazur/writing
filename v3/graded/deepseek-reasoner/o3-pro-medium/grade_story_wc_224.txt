<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, embodied through tactile interactions (e.g., "felt its directions via the texture"). Micro-choices under the reorganization threat reveal values. The final renunciation ("not a place I reentered but a direction") is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final syllable reconfigures the mountain's architecture with felt cost ("I felt the mountain exhale, grateful"). Orientation is taught early ("overgrown spine of slate...bookstore") and pattern payoff is flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices throughout (e.g., "shelves carved into living rock" force tactile navigation) and charging the final image ("corridors straightened, aligning...pulse"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("phosphorescent margins lit my feet").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens—the nightly reorganization forces the seeding action. Cost is legible when "words of the doorway clattered like teeth" and the protagonist risks being "sealed inside a chapter." One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the stone's reclamation and seeding action, resisting moralizing. The final answer ("home was not a place...but a direction") reweights prior material without abstraction. Subtext operates in imagery ("quiet thunder") and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("mercury-glass seer...mirror eyes tilted") and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful elision (e.g., "substituting reality nightly") is taught and paid off. POV is stable and voice remains coherent through stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("hidden thunder" recurs meaningfully). Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of bookstore-as-heart and language-as-seed. Risk-taking in metaphorical depth heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
