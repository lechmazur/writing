<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mila's motivation is clear and rooted in a stubborn refusal of bleakness, compelling her high-stakes choice to "teach dust to tell stories." Her actions are consistent, and her final choice to disperse the literate dust is a credible endurance with visible cost. However, her internal contradiction is more stated than shown in scene, with a slight reliance on summary ("stubborn as a metronome") that prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, landing with undeniable conceptual cost as the dust carries stories into the ordinary. The pattern of gathering and dispersing is taught early and pays off. The linkage from lyric to action is coherent, and the final image of the "thistled calm" reweights the prior famine with fertile hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. The ember alcove, shortwave glow, and trickle of seawater are tactile, purpose-driven details filtered through Mila's professional POV. The environment actively guides her quest, and the final image of dust settling in "every bell, gutter, and heartbeat" is a masterful, concrete payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift from gathering to dispersing the stories. The dominant stake (resurrecting language) is tested by the regime's threat, forcing Mila's ingenious, costly choice to cloak the broadcast in everyday sound. The cost is legible in her exhaustion and the dimming dial glow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict: language's resilience against oppression. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—stories hiding in life's clatter—that reweights the famine's cost without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in images like dust as "carbon ghosts" of burned books, embracing complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, professional-perceptual signature ("rosin-scented fingers," "thistled calm"). Purposeful compression and patterned diction ("secretly luminous") are taught early and paid off at closure. The pirate's voice is distinct yet brief, and the elision in the lyric's mechanics serves the mystery without breaking clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "syllables wobbling like candleflame"), but it coheres and supports the voice. One near-paraphrase loop ("dust was what remained of burned books, and dust was listening") slightly dulls momentum but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic scarcity, musicality, and pirate radio feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices—e.g., dust as a narrative medium. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the vision commits fully to its premise.</comment>
