<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Anisa's embodied trauma and micro-choices under pressure are vividly rendered, particularly when she freezes during the thunderclap. Her motivation to anchor optimism in realism is earned through specific horticultural actions. Malik's quiet perception adds crucible pressure without over-explanation. Minor deduction for his slightly underdeveloped backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly through sensory pattern-building. Closure lands with undeniable cost in the final pearl/lighthouse image that reconfigures trauma into focused light. Orientation is immediate and purposeful. The somatic marker method transforms prior material without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable—the arboretum constrains choices (glass wall exercise) and charges the final image (lighthouse lens). Sensory details are purposefully selective (salt-crisp air, trembling glass) and reflect Anisa's professional perception. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation through the tour group's somatic experience creates meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens. The thunderclap reversal tests Anisa's resilience, and Malik's intervention demonstrates agency. Cost is legible in the pulse-guided cadence recovery and planted seeds as vows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pearl motif's transformation from grief-object to focusing lens. The final image offers a non-literal answer to trauma recovery without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like Malik's dirt-lined fingertip on her wrist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV remains stable and distinct with a perceptive horticultural lexicon. Voice modulates effectively under pressure ("hearts synced to the rhythm of waves"). Minor filter verb use ("she pictured") in closure beat prevents higher scoring.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic without artifice. Figurative language serves pattern-building ("gulls wheeling like loose gears"). One minor paraphrase loop ("small enough to carry anywhere" / "evidence that even shattered things could frame beginnings") costs slight points.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of trauma recovery with horticultural and neuroscientific concepts feels inevitable. The somatic marker method is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation pays off at closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
