<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara's internal conflict is embodied and specific, with a clear motivation to defeat numbness driving her choices. Her final integration of memories is earned by her risky, non-violent approach. However, the clones, while thematically potent, function more as facets of her psyche than fully independent characters with distinct voices, slightly flattening the relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Mara integrates her clones, reconfiguring her personhood with a visible cost—the dissolution of her other selves. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through layered imagery and a cadence shift that culminates in the final, decisive integration. The cost is legible in the transformation of the clones into marble and orchids.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is a masterful micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. Its unstable nature, with continents rearranging below, directly constrains the conflict's stakes and tactics, forcing a non-physical resolution. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's heightened emotional state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as Mara's choice to pursue stillness and complementary breathing creates a decisive intensification. The cost is unmistakable: the dissolution of the clones, which is the price paid for her wholeness. The dominant stake (personhood) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of personhood as a shared, integrated state emerges organically from the core conflict and is resolved through a resonant, non-literal image: the clones becoming marble guardians and rainfall. The final line, "each footprint a choice vivified by compassion," offers a profound answer without moralizing, reweighting the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and controlled, with a poetic, elevated register that suits the metaphysical premise. POV is stable and deeply embedded in Mara's perception. Minor deductions for occasional moments where the dense figurative language slightly obscures immediacy, but the perceptual signature is strong and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly poetic and dense, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, this density occasionally borders on overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "temporal aftershocks cracked open sky scrolls"), creating minor clarity drags that slightly slow momentum without fundamentally obscuring the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core concept of a clone custody battle for personhood is brilliantly original and executed with full commitment. The synthesis of sci-fi (clones, brain in a jar) with spiritual dojo ritual feels inevitable and fresh. The risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
