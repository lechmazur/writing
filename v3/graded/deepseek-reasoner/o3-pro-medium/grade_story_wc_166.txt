<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sable's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her values. The final choice to ingest the moonstone and complete the poem is earned by her established competence and risk-taking. Her elective exile and artistic defiance feel consistent and deeply character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong, building pressure through sensory density and pattern until the final resonant reconfiguration. Closure is a charged poise—the planet "sighs, fully inscribed"—with cost legible in her exhaustion and elation. The nostalgia ban backstory is slightly under-integrated into the present action, a minor flaw.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely rendered and actively constrains choice: the garden's dampness necessitates treated pages, the cherub holds the moonstone, the environment itself becomes her parchment. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and deeply filtered through Sable's professional perception as a tide dancer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens: her choice to ingest the moonstone is a major tightening that risks drowning in memory. The cost is unmistakable—exhaustion drapes her, but she gains a new, permanent anchor. The stake (inscribing the world) is signaled early and paid off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action and image: art as an act of rebellion, memory made material. The final image of tide lilies blooming offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how banned nostalgia persists. No moralizing; subtext operates through implication and gorgeous metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature shaped by Sable's expertise. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity, particularly in the climactic ingestion and writing sequence. No POV slippage; elision is purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly poetic but maintains propulsion and clarity. Minor overwriting in a few phrases ("spontaneously anchored" appears twice, "fledge new senses" is slightly strained). However, rhythm is masterful, and the final paragraph's cadence is flawless, charging the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of concepts (tide dancer, nostalgia ban, cosmic inscription) feels inevitable and fresh. The moonstone as crystallized memory is a brilliant, specific inflection. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure pays off, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
