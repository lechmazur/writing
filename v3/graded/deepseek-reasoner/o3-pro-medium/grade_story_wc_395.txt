<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her high-stakes choices. Her "brightly attentive" trait and "forbidden curiosity" are well-established, though her emotional embodiment in peak moments occasionally leans toward summary (e.g., "Lyra's heart pounded"). The final choice to embrace the liberation of memories is earned by her prior causality and shows a visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly. The closure is a decisive change (liberating memories) with clear, felt cost (buckling archive, legal teams responding). The plot is tightly linked via the numbers, the patch, and Lyra's agency. Orientation is immediate and clear, anchoring who, where, and when within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "social network archive" and "Echo of Forgotten Songs" are masterfully rendered, acting as a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and supplies key resources. The setting constrains Lyra's actions (protocol forbidding entry) and charges the final image ("the missing were singing themselves back into being"). Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and deeply integrated with the POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lyra's agency under the causal lens, from following the numbers to lying to the daemon and finally initiating the trace route. The dominant stake (finding the astronauts/truth) is clear and tightens meaningfully with each step. The cost is legible on the page in the archive's buckling and the corporate response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment>The theme of memory, loss, and corporate control emerges organically from the specific events and the final, resonant image of the missing singing themselves back into being. It offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The core concept of a "cold case" is fully integrated into the stakes and tactics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, controlled texture. The prose is confident and the perceptual signature is strong. Minor deduction for a slight register drift in the line "Algorithms blamed coincidence, but Lyra recognized intents darker than random math," which feels slightly external to Lyra's immediate POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and propulsive, with excellent rhythmic control. Information is layered effectively. A minor instance of potential overwriting exists in "a chorus of thanks rose, each voice thin but alive, singing pieces of a lullaby they once shared in orbit," where the phrasing could be slightly tighter, but it does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a corporate memory keeper, a social media archive, and lost astronauts is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is committed to fully and executed with specificity and risk, transforming familiar sci-fi and noir tropes into a fresh, coherent whole.</comment>
