<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and deepens under pressure, with embodied micro-choices like measuring azimuths. The horizon mapper is vividly drawn, though her "restrained wildness" feels slightly more told than shown in peak moments. Their relationship as a crucible forces the protagonist's final vow, a meaningful change earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly from inciting incident to closure. The final Charged Poise ("a revolution kept breathing") reconfigures the world's tempo with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate; the viaduct's activation is a decisive change arising from established mechanics and character choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining every choice: the frozen lake dictates their path, the basalt viaduct is the engine of change. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("beads of iron gleaming like seeds"). The environment charges the final image, its magnetism and cold integral to the revolution's logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: the mapper's arrival narrows options, leading to the dangerous lake crossing and the precise viaduct alignment. The cost is legible in the protagonist's transformed impatience and the wolves' witness, a visible price for the new possibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between patience and impatience, crystallizing in the final image of the viaduct's melody. The concept of a "patient revolution" is a non-literal answer that reweights the narrative without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical voice that modulates under pressure ("the light did not explode; it unfolded, slow as moss"). Diction is consistently precise and voice-motivated. The narrator's internal texture remains coherent and specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with high information density and varied sentence structures. A minor instance of register drift occurs with "unyoking me from urgency," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon, but this is a hairline slip that does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of horizon mapping, lunar tracking, and magnetic viaducts is a fresh, non-obvious angle on revolution. The core concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and the bold risk of a quiet, patient revolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. A singular artistic stance.</comment>
