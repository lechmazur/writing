<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses (guilt, rebirth, quiet pulse) are embodied in micro-choices like exchanging paperwork for work gloves. Her final renunciation of urgency is earned by the tactile cost of salvage work and the parasol tip's recurring oracle function. The foreman's minimal presence applies relevant pressure without overreach for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of ice sounds and salvaged objects deepens Mara's fluency in endings, culminating in the blizzard's forced pause and the ice's "tectonic lullaby" reconfiguring her stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where her internal shoreline unfolds with patient bells, cost felt in the "quiet weight of postponed departure."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is indispensable, constraining choice (trapping the crew, forcing the blizzard pause) and charging the final image with the ice's "plural accents of endings." Sensory selection is masterful—wind scudding through parasol holes, coal stove steam, ice calves snapping—all filtered through Mara's perceptual urgency and rebirth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is accumulative: each salvaged object (red boot, photographs) deepens Mara's fluency in finality, tightening toward the blizzard's situational pressure that crystallizes her stance. Cost is legible in her postponed clinic visit, traded for the ice's harmony with her breath. Agency is endurance/attention that forecloses the expected path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the parasol tip's oracle function and the ice's dialects, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: endings are not isolated but "a slow chord trawled from ordinary hours." The final image of ice syllables harmonizing with breath reweights prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends medical precision ("pulse beat a quieter rhythm") and lyrical abstraction ("tectonic lullaby"). Diction remains within Mara's lexicon, and elision (e.g., mudslide details) is purposeful, paid off by the parasol's whistle echoing the landslide sigh. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures accelerating during the blizzard and breathing in reflective moments. Figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent (e.g., ice armor, shoreline bells). Minor artifact: "windborne solace" slightly abstract, but anchored by concrete sounds. No loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synthesis of euthanasia tourism, ice salvage, and inherited objects feels fresh and inevitable. The parasol tip as an "oracle for wounds" transforms a familiar trope. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity in salvage items (red boot, photographs) avoids generality.</comment>
