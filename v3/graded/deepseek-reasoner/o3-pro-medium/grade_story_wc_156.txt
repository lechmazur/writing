<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ada's characterization is vivid and specific, with her methodically playful spirit and desire to "exchange certainty for curiosity" motivating her actions. Her internal state is embodied through concrete actions (scraping varnish, humming, using the nickel) and her final satisfaction feels earned. The only minor weakness is a slight tendency toward articulate self-awareness in peak moments, but her flaws and competence are well-balanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds strongly, with pressure building through layered sensory and thematic density. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the city's shift to curiosity is felt, with cost legible in the "fresh ripple of questions" Ada feels. The structure is taut, with a clear inciting incident, escalating dialogue with the garden, and a final image that reconfigures the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Sound Wave Garden is an indispensable, active participant that constrains and enables choices through its acoustics. Sensory detail is masterfully integrated and filtered through Ada's professional POV, with the environment evolving causally with her actions. The setting charges the final image and is central to the story's logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by Ada's agency in her dialogue with the garden, each exchange deepening the stakes and narrowing her options toward a single path. The cost of exchanging certainty for curiosity is made legible on the page through the city's transformation and Ada's own unresolved questions. The dominant stake is clear and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of curiosity vs. certainty emerges organically from the specific events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. The garden's demand to "Loose the city's certainty" perfectly echoes Ada's private motive, creating a sophisticated thematic integration. The piece avoids moralizing, offering a complex, earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly calibrated to the Accumulative/Textural mode, with a consistent perceptual signature. The prose rhythm is controlled and purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity. Purposeful elision (e.g., the exact mechanics of "waking" the stone) is taught and paid off in the thematic closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor instance of slightly ornate phrasing ("polite gremlins") that, while voice-motivated, slightly softens the immediacy of a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, the line-level craft is flawless, propelling the story with concision and power.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story synthesizes a highly original premise (acoustic restoration magic) with deep thematic purpose. The combination of specific, grounded details (the hobo nickel, the solvents) with a lyrical, conceptual plot feels fresh and inevitable. The risk-taking with the accumulative mode heightens stakes and coheres perfectly, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
