<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mora's motivation to "shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her high-stakes choice. Her embodied emotion ("fingers tingled with the ache of future nostalgia") and micro-choices (rotating the wick) reveal character. However, her internal contradiction lacks simultaneous action in scene, leaning slightly toward summary, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse now emits "darkness shaped like guidance," reweighting the premise with undeniable cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through a decisive cadence shift and density increase that reconfigures meaning. The cost is legible in the final image's "calm more electric than fear."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Emerald lighthouse is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. It functions as a micro-setting whose properties (emerald slag prism, central vein) are tactile and crucial to the action. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Mora's professional priorities, with the environment actively shaping the narrative's outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, culminating in the decisive act of steering the shadows. The dominant stake (shaping the future) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. A visible cost is paid—the keeper's role becomes a perpetual burden ("relieved and condemned")—charging the final image and narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of steering narratives, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from the integration of concept (otherworldly routine) and character action. The final image of "dawn... shaped by hands that never touched the horizon" provides profound thematic resonance through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature and controlled rhythmic modulation under pressure. The voice is consistently poetic yet precise, with purposeful elision and compression that serves the accumulative design. Diction remains within Mora's plausible lexicon, and the prose texture is singular and effective throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor risks of overwriting in peak beats ("shadowed elation coursed outward") are present but do not obscure closure clarity. Sentence-level rhythm is masterfully controlled, and the read-aloud ear test is passed with virtuosic variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sentient lighthouse, storm herald, and conceptual navigation of narrative is fresh, non-obvious, and feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is fully committed to and executed with conceptual integrity and authentic vision.</comment>
