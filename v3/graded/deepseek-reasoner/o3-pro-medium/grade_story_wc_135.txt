<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Karima's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as archivist, with embodied emotion ("salt still bookmarking my coat"). Her micro-choices under pressure—pausing on steps, arranging fragments by gap-conversation—reveal hierarchy of values. Final renunciation (accepting meaning as tide) earned by prior causality with visible cost in council's shiver and gathered memories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragments compile into lattice through staggered intervals, culminating in Charged Poise where wind practices through valve. Closure lands with cost (council's vote, flickering candles as footnotes). Orientation clear by "ivory harbor after rain" and "ferry." One meaningful cadence shift suffices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (marble stairs glistening, room above tide-mark) and charges final image (wind through valve). Sensory detail purposeful and POV-filtered ("water smelled of pages too long closed"). Harbor's pulse recalibrating mirrors internal state. Ivory harbor after rain recurs meaningfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring meaning) signaled early. Escalation driven by agency: Karima's method of staggered intervals forces councilors to offer fragments, tightening through lattice emergence. Cost legible in "holes blowing through recollection" and council's shiver. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of absence/navigation emerges through fragments and valve's resonance, not statement. Ending offers non-literal answer: "what we salvage tomorrow will steer what we invent next." Subtext in wind practicing through valve. Complexity embraced without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("gulls picked arguments," "pages too long closed"). POV stable, voice consistent with lyrical compression. Elision taught early ("staggered intervals") pays off in closure. No head-hopping. Diction reflects archivist's worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion. Figurative language cohesive ("patch the wind"). No loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies naturally with sentence length. Read-aloud quality strong. Peak beats maintain clarity without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archivist role with memory repair. Valve as resonant absence transforms trope. Specificity in "plum brine" and "chalk maps." Risk-taking in silent instrument payoff heightens stakes. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
