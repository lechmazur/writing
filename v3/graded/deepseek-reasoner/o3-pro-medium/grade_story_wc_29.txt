<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mina's characterization is precise and driven by consistent, contradictory impulses (hope vs. caution, idealism vs. cynicism toward Calvin). Her final choice to invert the signal is earned by prior causality, showing a micro-choice hierarchy that values unity over recognition. The cost is felt in her isolation and the dimming lights' quiet disapproval, scaling perfectly to the length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the plot tightens through because/therefore linkages: the signal warns, Mina seeks an ally, Calvin's opportunism forces her solo action. Closure is a Decisive Change (tricksters repelled, unity achieved) with cost legible in Calvin's slumped defeat and the auroras' celebratory yet fragile tie. The persistent constraint of human division shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The radio booth and astronomical charts function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "blinking red LEDs like candles in a crypt" mirrors the stakes). The environment pressures tactics, as the auxiliary antenna and amphitheater subwoofers become crucial tools.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mina's agency under the Causal lens: Calvin's arrival forces a peak choice where she must nullify his algorithm. The cost is unmistakable in the "cavernous" room and his deflation, foreclosing his path and risking their relationship. Stakes shift from decoding to actively defending unity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of unity versus exploitation emerges through particulars (protest signs, cocoa sharing) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "cleverness could be kinder than conquest." The final image of auroras tying stories together reweights prior divisions with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("static snow hissed," "smelled of power plays"). Voice modulates under pressure, compressing into grit during the climax. Elision (e.g., signal mechanics) is taught early and pays off. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, revealing Calvin's silk-over-steel opportunism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density ("subsonic frequencies rumbled like underground thunder"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during Calvin's confrontation. No loops or artifacts obscure closure. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, enhancing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic myth and modern tech feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking with subsonic peace frequencies heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific detail (e.g., redirected comets, socio-astrophysics) and a non-obvious moral calculus favoring subtle unity over amplification.</comment>
