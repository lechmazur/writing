<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The survivor's motivation to rectify loss through translating silence is clear, embodied, and intensifies under pressure. Micro-choices, like selecting specific tuning forks and using his own heart as a buffer, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final endurance is earned by prior causality. A slight deduction for a minor diagnostic label ("my own confusion") in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with escalation via pattern density and a cadence shift. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final image of guarding the chord. A minor orientation deduction: the precise nature of the "cataclysm" and "disaster" remains slightly abstract past the 120-word window, though it doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully integrated into action. The frozen ocean and glass pillars are not just described but actively pressure the protagonist's tactics and define the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from observation to active, risky intervention with the forks. The cost is unmistakable as he uses his own body to buffer the chord, preventing shattering. The dominant stake (translating silence) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of music surviving impossible silence emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the sketched score and the act of guarding the chord. It avoids moralizing and sits in complex, earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, precise, and scientifically observant. The voice modulates with emotional intensity without losing coherence. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight figurative overload in a high-pressure beat (e.g., "pain like molten snow"), which creates a momentary muddle. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are maintained, with no loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise—using sound frequencies to translate frozen silence into chromatic music—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. It is executed with conceptual integrity and bold risk-taking, fully committing to its own unique logic. The combination feels organic and inevitable, not derivative.</comment>
