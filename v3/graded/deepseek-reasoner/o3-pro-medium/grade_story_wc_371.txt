<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias is vividly realized through embodied micro-choices (testing soil, surrendering seeds) and a clear, conflicted motivation. His guilt and professional curiosity create authentic interior contradiction. The final choice to continue his work feels earned, though the phrase "professional curiosity" in the climax leans slightly toward diagnostic labeling, costing a hairline deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias's perspective shifts, feeling "the first credible taste of absolution." The inferred hybrid lens (causal/accumulative) holds, with the pavilion's warmth and Madam Ko's dialogue serving as causal triggers that deepen the thematic stakes. The cost of his lifelong guilt is legibly resolved in the final image of him "already charting" his next move.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is an active agent, constraining and enabling choice. The courtyard's forgotten state enables guerrilla gardening, and the pavilion's locked door presents a tangible obstacle. The final image of "wet leafscape" and "silver threads" charges the closure, visually representing the alternative normality Elias plants.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from cataloging loss to actively planting an alternative, driven by Elias's agency. The encounter with Madam Ko deepens the conflict from observation to participation, forcing a stance crystallization. The cost is his relinquished guilt, made legible through the steam dragon image and his final vow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action and image (seedballs, bread, steam) without moralizing. The final realization that "sacredness is merely the ordinary relieved of its disguise" is a non-literal, earned answer to the central question, reweighting all prior material. It avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical voice that filters the world through Elias's specific expertise. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext. The prose's rhythmic control and patterned elision ("quiet potential"/"quiet bloom") are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly efficient, with sentences performing multiple jobs. A minor paraphrase loop exists between "neglected places, like neglected people" and "noticing creeping normality is only half the task," but it does not obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of guerrilla gardening, spiritual absolution, and urban decay is fresh and specific. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, fully committed to its premise. The risk of a quiet, contemplative climax pays off by heightening thematic stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
