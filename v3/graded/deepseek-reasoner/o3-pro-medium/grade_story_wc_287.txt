<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Milo's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with his "wistfully pragmatic" nature driving every choice. His motivation to find light for Nara intensifies believably, compelling higher-stakes action. The final choice to bring her to the prism is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in their trembling descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly; the lockmaster's hint directly motivates the journey, and the tooth's use unlocks the central conflict. Closure is a decisive change (the prism is healed, light returns) with a resonant reconfiguration—the siblings become co-stewards. Cost is legible in the image of Nara's trembling hands on the glass.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The luminous harbor and floodgate tower are not just atmospheric but actively constrain and enable choice. The micro-setting of the prism chamber is indispensable, its failing state dictating Milo's actions and charging the final image. Sensory detail is exquisite and wholly integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the first paragraph (hope for Nara) and escalate through a meaningful tightening: the rose dies, the prism is failing. Milo's agency drives every turn under the causal lens. The cost is felt in the risk of bringing his frail sister into the tower, a trade-off that narrows options and heightens tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of care, light, and vulnerability emerges organically from concrete images and actions, never stated. The final image of the new rosebush offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of sustaining hope. Subtext is rich in gestures like the "protected vulnerability" of the harbor's mist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Milo's poetic, gardener's perception. The voice is distinct and consistent, with a rhythmic, lyrical quality that modulates perfectly with emotional intensity. The patterned repetition of "rhythm of oars in water" is taught early and pays off brilliantly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is precise and purposeful, enhancing clarity rather than muddying it. The read-aloud rhythm is masterful, particularly in the closing paragraphs. A single minor deduction for the slightly ornate "luminous harbor by moonlight."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a magical realist harbor light-system with the intimate stakes of sibling care feels fresh and inevitable. The concept is executed with full commitment and authentic vision. A slight ornamental quality to the "quivering hush" motif prevents a perfect score, but the overall ingenuity is exceptional.</comment>
