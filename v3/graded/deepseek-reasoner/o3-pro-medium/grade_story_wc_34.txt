<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and poetic ("half of him sailed with the vapors"), and the motivation to "build a mouth for silence" is clear and intensifies. However, the character's "driftingly alert" state is more observed than tested by a contradictory on-page impulse, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the ghost's song is encoded and the balladeer moves on; cost is legible in the transient, unobserved nature of his art ("would look like playful vandalism to casual eyes").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The courtyard is a micro-setting that actively pressures the action through the storm's timeframe and provides the wall as a canvas. The flower press bolt plate constrains choice as a pivot tool. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift and density increase as the ghost interacts directly, revealing its true motive. The stake—to articulate unspoken needs before servers rot—is tightened by this revelation, and the cost of transient, unobserved art is felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of giving voice to silence emerges organically through the specific action of encoding graffiti. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the prayers "already glowed above the morning traffic." Avoids moralizing, sitting in complex ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent, lyrical perceptual signature ("hummed like a silver bowl"). Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off. The voice modulates beautifully with pressure, and the prose remains character-bound throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, not ornamental. A single minor paraphrase loop ("driftingly alert" is repeated) prevents a perfect score, but it does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a code ghost, graffiti, and a balladeer is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable. The core premise is fully committed to and followed to its logical, poignant conclusion. The emotional truth and singularity of vision are exceptional.</comment>
