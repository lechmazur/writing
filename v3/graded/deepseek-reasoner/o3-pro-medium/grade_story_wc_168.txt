<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rowan's characterization is deeply embodied and contradictory, with "hard softness" shown through voice and actions. His micro-choice to offer Juniper the porcelain shard reveals his values under pressure. The final renunciation of his bargained innocence feels earned by prior causality, though his backstory reflection slightly exceeds the 20% allowance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration through the shared moment with Juniper. Cost is legible in "translation had begun" and Juniper's gesture. Orientation is immediate, and the pattern of imagery tightens meaningfully toward the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge and porcelain box function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Rowan's professional perception. The box's fracture lines and the ridge's spatial presence actively shape the ritual's outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake of translating pain escalates through Juniper's arrival, forcing Rowan to enact his philosophy. Agency shifts from solitary reflection to shared stewardship, narrowing options. Cost is visible in the renegotiated bargain and Juniper's acceptance of the shard, though the escalation relies slightly on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the porcelain box, ashes, and scars, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to pain's translation through the image of "alternating verses." Subtext operates powerfully in gestures and silence, particularly Juniper's wordless arrival.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—professional yet poetic. Diction remains within Rowan's lexicon even under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven when present. The prose rhythm modulates beautifully with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor overwriting risk in peaks ("something smaller than regret") but no coherence issues. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Read-aloud rhythm is compelling and varied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of firefighter trauma and poetic sensibility feels organic and inevitable. Specific details (porcelain shard, celestial dance) avoid cliché. Risk-taking in lyrical density pays off with heightened stakes and coherence. Transforms familiar tropes through grounded particularity.</comment>
