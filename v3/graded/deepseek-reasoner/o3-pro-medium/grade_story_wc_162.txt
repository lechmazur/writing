<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's "featherly determined" resolve is embodied in her tactile interaction with the logbook and wood grain, culminating in a final choice to guard the terrace—a renunciation that forecloses immediate return with a visible cost. Her internal contradiction (fear of closing the cathedral of absence) is dramatized in-scene, not summarized. The final endurance is earned by causality: the charred page sliver reconfigures her understanding of her father's abandonment as choreography.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the terrace steadies and Mira senses the maze rebuilding from "deliberate gaps," reweighting absence with purpose. Cost is legible in "she would return... not to be found but to walk the sacred threshold." Orientation is deliberately disoriented early but taught and paid off; the prism's fracture mirrors her internal state and resolves into promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace and wood grain are micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The terrace's instability forces attentive balance; the wood grain's "knots formed thresholds" directly enables Mira's breakthrough. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "varnish gleamed like trapped sunset"), and the environment evolves causally with her realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens: her decision to intuit the grain pattern deepens her knowledge and narrows options, leading to the revelation of the charred page. The cost is felt in her fear that finding the map might "close the cathedral," and her final stance crystallizes through this trade-off. Pressure coheres through symbolic density rather than causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the reconfiguration of "necessary distances" from abandonment to sacred choreography. The final image offers a non-literal answer: the sacred is "what you dared to turn through." Subtext operates in gesture (Arin offering the chair) and image (the cathedral of absence). Complexity is maintained; the father's instruction is reinterpreted but not morally simplified.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature ("featherly determined," "pastel kaleidoscopes"). Lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven ("Sit, and intuit the pattern"); Arin's question functions as action. Diction remains within Mira's plausible lexicon, even at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control ("fractured hush," "wind stumble through weather code"). Figurative language is pattern-taught and consistent, avoiding muddle. Minor scaffold exists in adjacent sentences ("The terrace belonged to Arin... His invitation"), but it does not obscure closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally with the emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of corn maze architecture, weather codes, and metaphysical inquiry feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "necessary distances" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in lyric compression and disorientation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final image is bold and authentically singular.</comment>
