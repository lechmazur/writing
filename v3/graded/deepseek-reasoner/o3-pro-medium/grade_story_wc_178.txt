<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Naram-ben's frugality and intellectual terror are embodied contradictions that drive his sacrifice. His final choice to offer the astrolabe is earned by prior causality, with the cost of losing his last instrument feeling tangible and scaled to his character. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on descriptive labels ("miserly nature") in the opening, though this is quickly overshadowed by concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through density and pattern until a decisive cadence shift at closure. The final image of the extra row of numbers reconfigures the premise with undeniable conceptual cost, proving mystery expands without losing equilibrium. The orientation is clear within the first 100 words, and the closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration that is both felt and conceptually weighty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The palace setting is not a postcard but an active, pressure-exerting entity, its "dusky harmony" and "reimagined halls" filtering through the astronomer's perception. The magic square tile and the dry fountain are micro-settings that crucially constrain his choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and wholly integrated into the action, reflecting his professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens, his schematic attempts intensifying the pressure until the ritual demands his ultimate sacrifice. The cost is unmistakable on the page as his astrolabe sinks into the "liquid thought" of the tile. This single, meaningful tightening forecloses his old path of mere thrift and reweights his relationship to discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of discovery as an act of devotion emerges organically from the specific events and the final, resonant image. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the astronomer's entire endeavor without moralizing. The core concept is fully integrated, resisting tidy resolution and embracing the beautiful complexity of "unending questions."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature that marries scientific precision ("schematic representations") with mythic grandeur ("covenant with the unknown"). The rhythmic prose modulates perfectly with emotional intensity, and the patterned, lyrical elision is taught early and pays off magnificently at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and enhances clarity rather than muddying it. A single, very minor deduction for a potentially mixed metaphor ("silence shimmered"), though it is largely effective in establishing the tone. Rhythm is masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of high-concept fantasy and mathematical precision feels entirely fresh and organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, resulting in a singular artistic vision. The risk-taking—blending the esoteric with the emotionally resonant—heightens stakes and meaning without a hint of gimmickry.</comment>
