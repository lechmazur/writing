<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s embodied authority and Doyle’s resigned hope are rendered through specific micro-choices and sensory filtering. Her final choice to leave, carrying only "traveled stillness," is an Earned Stasis that forecloses her personal stay with a cost felt in the library’s warmth and the city’s unfamiliar peace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the invisible, stubborn chord braiding diverse voices reconfigures the city's meaning. Cost is legible in the councilors' "bewildered relief" and the library's vow, all arising from pattern breaks in silence and sound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The velvet library and zither rosette are not just atmospheric but actively constrain choices and charge the final image. The rosette's "pulse like a heartbeat" at the climax and the alcove's "queer acoustics" are indispensable environmental pressures that shape the entire narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency under the accumulative lens, moving from gathering voices to teaching subtraction to facing the council. The cost is unmistakable in the dissolution of arguments "not in defeat but in resonance" and the councilors' synced breaths, all tightening the stake of communal harmony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "vanishing arts" and the method of "subtracting noise," resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of an "invisible yet stubborn" chord, reweighting prior conflict into peace without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Doyle’s perception, with a distinct lyrical texture. The voice modulates beautifully under pressure, e.g., "throat tight, realized the library itself was learning." Purposeful compression ("across unlearning hatred") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. No loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful ("dust motes that shone like lanterns"). Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs, accelerating tension and breathing in rests.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a choir teacher using a silent instrument to heal civic strife through harmonic subtraction is highly original and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, fully committing to its lyrical premise.</comment>
