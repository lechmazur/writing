<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marlen's motivation ("to discover what ceilings hide") is concrete and consistently drives his choices, culminating in the decision to retrieve the mainspring. His skillfully observant trait is dramatized through specific actions like analyzing dust patterns, and his unique ability to see ghosts provides both companionship and warnings, adding depth. A minor deduction for the slightly abstract phrasing of his quest's origin, but his final choice to donate the device is earned and carries a visible cost of personal burden lifted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure builds through layered sensory and supernatural details, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure is a decisive change: retrieving the mainspring settles the ghosts and reconfigures the setting's stalled time, with cost legible in the "cracks relaxing" and Marlen feeling "lighter." Causality is tight, with each discovery leading to the next, and the final image reweights the entire premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail. The abandoned circus ticket office is not just described but actively pressures the action, its decay and supernatural residue constraining Marlen's choices. Key objects—the mainspring, the vent, the dust patterns—are integral to the plot and charge the final image. The environment is a character, its atmosphere woven seamlessly into the narrative's progress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (discovering what's hidden) and escalate through Marlen's investigation, driven by his agency under the Accumulative lens. The discovery of the mainspring represents a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge and forces a consequential choice. The cost is felt in the ghosts' relief and the building's exhale, though the final choice itself carries a slightly minimized personal risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pursuit of hidden truths and the burden of unresolved time. The concept of "cracks in the façade" is realized literally and metaphorically, reweighted by the final image of those cracks "relaxing." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about closure and rest without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the ghosts' warnings and the building's sentient feel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Marlen's professional and perceptive lens. The voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a rhythmic cadence that supports the eerie atmosphere ("wind-whistled posters," "heart drumming like a calliope"). Purposeful elision (e.g., the exact nature of the ghosts) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished and evocative, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. Minor deduction for a few instances of slightly elevated diction ("weightless burden," "opalescent grays") that, while voice-motivated, verge on ornamentation in a high-pressure beat. However, clarity and momentum are maintained throughout, and the closure image is delivered with potent clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of an elevator repair technician who sees ghosts with an abandoned circus setting is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded details and a unique moral calculus about time and closure. The story commits fully to its singular vision, and the final reconfiguration is a fresh, earned inflection that heightens the stakes.</comment>
