<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's watchful, proactive nature is embodied through concrete actions like mapping constellations and chiseling resin. Rowan's emotional progression feels earned, with trembling hands steadying through purposeful work. Their micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values—healing over hiding—with visible cost. The final shared sleep is an Earned Stasis that forecloses isolation, charged by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through density of imagery and cadence shifts (e.g., "honeyed hush" to shared rhythm of work). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—as they sleep "wrapped in roots they had chosen together," reconfiguring vulnerability into strength. Cost is legible in Rowan's tears "not breaking upon his smile" and the garden accepting salt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The data center-moss garden is indispensable, constraining choices (e.g., chiseling resin from servers) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is purposefully selective ("chlorophyll hummed," "smelled of electrolyte and loam"). Spatial choreography is coherent, with aisles and center chamber guiding movement. The setting evolves causally, hosting new life that mirrors internal change.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under Accumulative lens: Mara's invitation to work deepens stakes from personal refuge to shared redemption. One meaningful tightening occurs when Rowan accepts the screwdriver, narrowing options toward active healing. Cost is felt in his tearful smile and the garden's incorporation of salt. Coincidence (reporters tracking him) complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grafting meaning onto wounds through concrete actions (mapping constellations, planting seeds). Subtext operates in gestures (proffering the pendant) and imagery (gnat witnessing epochs). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—healing scales quietly—without moralizing. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, embracing complexity in silence that "tasted sweet."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("chlorophyll hummed with a honeyed hush"). Diction remains within Mara's plausible lexicon, even under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven ("come" advances plot; Rowan's confession alters tactics). Rhythm controls tension, accelerating with notification and slowing to contemplative cadence at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished: high information density ("amberish flakes that smelled faintly of pine" does multiple jobs). Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught ("honeyed hush" recurs with payoff). No loops or scaffolding; sentences vary rhythmically. Final image ("dew rehearsing tomorrow's constellation") charges closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise is freshly synthesized: abandoned tech reclamation as emotional healing. Tropes (confessional aftermath) are transformed through specific grounded choices (using server racks for moss). Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry. Inevitability in hindsight: the garden's logic feels singular and fully committed.</comment>
