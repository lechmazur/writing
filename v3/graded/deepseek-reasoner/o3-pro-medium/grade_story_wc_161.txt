<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marietta's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her backstory of betrayal, compelling her high-stakes choice to send the bird. Her internal conflict between fear and duty is embodied and contradictory, not summarized. The final choice to trust is earned by the graduate's plea and her own remembered cost, with a visible cost in burning her papers. A slight deduction for the "bloom and wither" emotional state feeling slightly abstract at the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The inferred drive lens is Hybrid, leaning Accumulative/Textural, with pressure escalating through the density of dust patterns and the meteorite's silent score until it forces a stance crystallization. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she releases the bird, reconfiguring her relationship to trust with a felt cost. The cost is legible in the burning of her papers and the "ash settled like gray snow." A minor deduction for the graduate's introduction feeling slightly coincidental, though it complicates rather than resolves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The attic setting is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. It supplies the skylight for dust-mapping and the rafters for the aerodrome, constraining and enabling her tactics. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through her professional POV ("perfumed runway," "swirling diagrams"). The environment evolves with the plot, becoming an "archive, aviary, and confessional."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is a cadence shift: the dust patterns change, deepening her knowledge and forcing the final choice to send the meteorite. The dominant stake (preserving song/learning to trust) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. The cost is unmistakable: exposing a fragile bond to potential interception and burning her personal history. Agency is her decision to release the bird, which forecloses her path of hiding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of trust, loss, and artistic preservation, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the departing bird and the burning papers, reweighting the "paper trails" motif from condemnation to becoming. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image (e.g., weighing the room, feeding names to the stove). The final paragraph avoids moralizing, achieving emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature, noticing the world through the lens of music and flight ("silent score," "tiny aerodrome"). The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression (e.g., the summary of her exile) increases density without harming momentum. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and avoids muddle ("blooming withering beauty," "paper trails spiraled outward like migrating constellations"). There are no synonym loops, template cadence, or scaffold sentences. A single, very minor artifact: "bloom and wither" is slightly abstract in the final line, but it is pattern-taught and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The core premise synthesizes a pigeon trainer, a memory-holding meteorite, and dust-mapping into a fresh, organic whole that feels inevitable in hindsight. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The story commits fully to its lyrical, accumulative design. A slight deduction as the core concept, while brilliant, has echoes of other "memory object" narratives, preventing a top-tier originality score.</comment>
