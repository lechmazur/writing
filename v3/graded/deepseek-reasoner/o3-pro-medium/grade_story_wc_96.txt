<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rook and Mira exhibit rich interiority through embodied emotion and micro-choices, such as Rook's "stability masquerading as wreckage" declaration. Their shared history informs present actions, and Mira's transition from prison to freedom deepens her motivation. The final choice to "molt together" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in their shared risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the library transforms through collective imagination. Cost is legible in the "gleaming steel beneath" rust and the tangible risk of authorities. Orientation is immediate, and the pattern of linguistic rebellion escalates coherently to the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The library setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image—its decay and renewal are central to the conflict. Sensory details are purposefully filtered through Rook's poetic perception ("cracks like illuminated vines"). The environment evolves causally with the narrative, becoming a character itself.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the Accumulative lens through density increases—the arrival of townspeople transforms the conflict from personal to communal. Agency is clear in Rook and Mira's active choices, like scattering "seed packets of words." Cost is visible in the structural renewal and the threat of sirens, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the integration of anarchy and beauty, resistance and rebuilding. The final image of "luminous fracture" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like Mira's whistle, a code "promising pages instead of chains."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a poetic, perceptual signature ("glittered like broken glass"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in exchanges like Rook's declaration of "stability masquerading as wreckage." POV remains stable and deeply embedded in Rook's consciousness, with elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is densely poetic but maintains clarity and momentum, with high information density. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("sirens coughed") slightly obscures immediacy but does not harm closure. Rhythm is controlled and varies naturally, supporting the accumulative texture without loops or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of poetic rebellion and literal rebuilding is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in voice and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details like the coffee tin and seed packets, avoiding derivative templates.</comment>
