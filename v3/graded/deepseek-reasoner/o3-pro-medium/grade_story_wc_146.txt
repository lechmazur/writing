<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation evolves credibly from map-making to rebuilding, with micro-choices under pressure (kneeling, matching steps) revealing her values. Marek's cryptic patience is embodied, not labeled. The final choice to stay and walk feels earned by the tactile experience of the town's rebirth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through rhythmic footfalls and sensory density, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the town is reborn. The cost is legible in Lira's tears and the fork's transfer, signaling her inherited burden. Causality is tight and closure is undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ebony tuning fork and cobblestones are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "cobblestones remembered his footsteps," "heat in the ground like coals"). The archway and town act as a crucible, pressuring the protagonists' actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonists' agency under the Accumulative lens: their walking ritual intensifies the town's reanimation. The dominant stake (revival) is signaled early and deepens with each resonant step. The cost is Lira's acceptance of perpetual duty, felt in the fork's transfer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: balance through sound and movement, not words. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—rebirth requires perpetual, patient choreography. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., "heartbreak was the seed of hope"). Resists moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, measured rhythm that mirrors the ritual. Diction is precise and voice-motivated ("a resonant promise"). Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext and advances the plot. Elision (e.g., the collapse's cause) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished: high information density, varied syntax, and zero artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful ("dust lifted like waking birds"). Rhythm accelerates and breathes with the walking cadence. No loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of familiar elements (ghost town, magical object) through specific, grounded execution. The walking-as-revival method is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Authentic vision.</comment>
