<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Janus's spiritual curiosity and empathy are vividly embodied, driving his pivotal choice to heal rather than seal. His internal shift from seeking strength in vulnerability is earned through specific, concrete action (tracing meteor arcs, cross-referencing dust). A minor deduction for a slight motivational blur at the alarm's trigger—wonder feels primary, but protocol's weight is less immediate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Janus's act of healing reweights his role and the station's meaning. The cost is legible in the final image of his "fissures knit in sympathetic resonance." One causality hiccup: the alarm's cause (cracked jar) is slightly detached from the emotional core, but it doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The station is a masterful micro-setting that constrains and enables the central choice (observatory hatch, vacuum, broom). The yellow lantern glass is a recurring object that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, woven through action ("broom gliding like a low comet," "vacuum howled").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift—Janus's choice to trace the paths and then heal the shard. The dominant stake (finding meaning/purpose) tightens meaningfully. Agency is clear, though the initial alarm is a situational complication rather than a causally driven pressure point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (strength in vulnerability, finding meaning in overlooked acts) emerges organically from Janus's specific actions and the final image of the repaired lantern sailing away. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The concept of "flourishing stillness" is integrated as a lived experience, not a stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a poetic, perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure ("silence grew dense enough to nourish a flourishing stillness"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through Janus's consciousness. The elision of how the glass repairs itself is purposeful and pays off in the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush but precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design ("primal elegance," "whispering comets"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. A single minor artifact: "spiritually curious" edges toward label-speak but is immediately anchored in concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cosmic janitor, metaphysical repair, and accumulative lyricism feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is executed with high conceptual integrity and authenticity of vision. The risk of elevated diction pays off by heightening stakes and coherence, fully supporting the closure.</comment>
