<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied through micro-choices (calculating exchange rates, seizing the moment) and a clear, contradictory internal conflict between her honest nature and her father's legacy. Her final choice is earned by the pressure and her established calculation of a "fair trade." The only minor deduction is for a slight over-articulation of her father's maxim, which borders on diagnostic summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The causal drive lens is clear and holds: Corvus's threat forces Mara's choice, and her prepared defense with the ink pot shard creates a decisive change (escape) with a visible cost (abandoning her life and the ink pot). Orientation is immediate, and the closure lands with undeniable cost on the page ("one life surrendered for two lives protected").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prep room setting is vividly rendered and purposeful ("cold coils inhaled and exhaled"), but it primarily functions as a container rather than actively constraining choices in a way that charges the final image. The ink pot is the key micro-setting object that fulfills this role, but the room itself does not.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven cleanly by protagonist agency under the causal lens: Corvus's direct threat narrows Mara's options to signing or death, forcing her to activate her prepared plan. The cost is unmistakable and paid on the page (Corvus's death, the abandonment of her life).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of "fair trade" is intricately woven into the narrative's fabric, from Mara's whispered equations to the final calculation of "one life surrendered for two." It culminates in a resonant, non-literal answer—the world as a "problem set" solvable by "liquefying rigid thinking"—that reweights the entire story without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and controlled, with a perceptive, analytical texture fitting a mortician calculating moral equations. POV is stable. A very minor deduction for a few phrases that lean slightly ornate ("twitching like an unreleased theorem"), but the voice remains coherent and character-specific under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly efficient, with nearly every line doing multiple jobs. A minor rhythmic stumble occurs in the paragraph beginning "Minutes passed heavy..." where the clauses could be tighter. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional, propelling the story with clarity and purpose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a con artist's daughter working as a mortician, using an ink pot weaponized for political asylum, is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with bold, specific choices that heighten the stakes and coherence.</comment>
