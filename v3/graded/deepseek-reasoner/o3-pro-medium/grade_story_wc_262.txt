<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her high-stakes choice to project the film. Her interiority is concrete and particular, though a brief moment of diagnostic self-awareness ("she realized the letters were still incubating") slightly dampens the embodied emotion. Her final choice is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with a visible cost—the release of the love—and her emotional progression feels credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands on the page with a felt cost: the release of the love through Mira's sigh and the city's hum. The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout, as pressure escalates through density increases and a cadence shift (projecting the film). The persistent constraint of the silent film and the search for the tune shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The projection booth and film strip function as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through Mira's professional gaze. The environment guides her choice through the specific tools (projector, film) and the spatial choreography is coherent. The recurring object (film) evolves causally with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in her decisive act of projecting the film. The cost is legible on the page: the release of the love and the transformation of the silence. Pressure coheres and grows through density and a cadence shift, reweighting the dominant stake. The resolution is earned by her alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of unused love emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of circulated love and the city humming. Subtext operates in implication, and the piece invites reflection without moralizing. The core concept integrates with theme through specific events, resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose has a distinct texture, though a slight register drift occurs in the psychometry corridor description ("Ink glowed phosphorescent"). Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off at closure. Internal thought formatting is consistent, and the voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong information density. However, minor overwriting appears in the psychometry corridor beat ("walls lined with goodbye letters instead of wallpaper... each paragraph sighed a name"), applying a slight deduction. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence-level propulsion is strong. No loops or scaffold issues obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on love and memory, synthesized through specific character and setting. The combination feels organic, not checklist-driven. The final reconfiguration feels earned and inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the vision feels authentic.</comment>
