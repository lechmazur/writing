<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("palms smeared with loam"). The final choice to rebuild the sundial is earned by prior causality of exile and lost faith, with visible cost in the hollow feeling. Contradictory impulses of fear and cautious enchantment act simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density and pattern toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with cost ("hollow in my chest") and the final image of the tracking shadow reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clear by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("roots coiling around skulls that smirked like theatrical masks"). The sundial base is a micro-setting that actively shapes the protagonist's pivotal decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, moving from observation to the decisive act of placing the tent peg. Cost is legible in the reconfiguration of belief and the resolve to stay. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interrupted journeys and restored faith emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the sundial's new arm tracking "the slow return of trust."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. POV is stable and voice is consistent, with a lyrical, measured quality that fits the protagonist's reflective nature. Purposeful elision (e.g., the dream conversation) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is cohesive and purposeful ("fruit fall like muted bells"). Minor artifact: "cautious enchantment" is repeated, but it serves as a taught pattern and charges the final tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A fresh, specific synthesis of diaspora return and archaeological discovery feels organic and inevitable. The concept of interrupted journeys is transformed through grounded character choices and a unique setting. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
