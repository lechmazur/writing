<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lysar's motivation is clear and consistent, his regal humility embodied in action. Selestine's quiet fervor is a credible ignition point. Their alliance is forged through mutual humility, a micro-choice that reveals values. The final choice to sunder is earned by their established tactics, though Selestine's internal conflict is less explored than Lysar's enduring patience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly; the plan to use the rune is a logical escalation of established methods. Closure is a decisive change (the pretender's unmasking) with clear cost (the collective vertigo and the throne emptying). The final image of the library preparing for the next truth is a resonant reconfiguration that charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The library is a pressure cooker, its strange time and spiraling shelves constraining and enabling the central conflict. The iron gall ink pellet and mirrors are key objects that directly charge the final, decisive action. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, like dust exhaled like incense.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the outset. Escalation is driven by agency: first amplifying messages, then the scriptorium plot, culminating in the Hall of Mirrors confrontation. The cost is legible in the court's collective vertigo and the pretender's vanishing. A single, powerful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus deception emerges organically through the rune's function and the protagonists' methods. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the throne is emptied to become genuine again. Subtext operates in implication, such as the lies seeping like oil, avoiding direct moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and effectively omniscient, with a distinct, lyrical texture. The voice is confident and consistent, though the elevated diction occasionally flirts with register drift in high-pressure beats ("sunder"). No dialogue is present, so those criteria are waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly stylized, with strong rhythmic control. However, this creates a high density of figurative language that, while often beautiful, can slightly slow momentum and occasionally obscure clarity (e.g., "years folded like paper cranes"). A minor artifact penalty is applied for this decorative density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of a diminutive titan librarian and a magical rune of drift is a fresh synthesis. The execution is specific and grounded, though the core premise of a hidden heir and a false ruler is a familiar fantasy trope. The story's ingenuity lies in its particular execution and voice, not a radically original premise.</comment>
