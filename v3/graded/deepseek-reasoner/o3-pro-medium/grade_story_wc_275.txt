<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amber's characterization is rich with embodied contradiction: her pacifism is tested by her father's return, yet she chooses to sheathe her knife. Her "senseless perceptiveness" is demonstrated concretely when she closes the vents, and her final choice to offer virtues instead of violence is earned by prior causality. The only minor flaw is a slight pronoun drift ("Cullin entered, boots dusted, eyes scanning...") which momentarily obscures POV.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through density of symbolic meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the council's impatience is sheathed by the engraved quiet. The cost is legible in the final image of planting seeds outside the dome, trusting wind to carry calm. Orientation is immediate and the pattern of quiet versus conflict is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The glass-domed rose farm is indispensable, constraining choice (venting to save plants) and charging the final image (petals like small shields). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Amber's expertise ("stems dried out"). The setting is a crucible that pressures every tactical move.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase: the physical threat of the convoy is met with a deepening of the central stake (calm vs. fear). Amber's agency—offering the tray of virtues—narrows options and forces a stance crystallization in the leader. The cost is the vulnerability of planting outside the dome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between engraved quiet and violent requisition. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: continuity is woven with roots, not blood. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture (Cullin holding a watering can) and the charged reprise of the sandbag scrap.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Amber's perceptual signature ("listening to the hush of the dome"). Diction is consistently within her lexicon, and syntax varies to match emotional intensity. A minor template cadence appears in "Dusk burned the sky a tranquil blaze of peach and copper when the dome door sighed open," but it is voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. However, a template cadence run occurs in the description of Cullin ("He was built of muscle and regrets, yet his gaze softened..."). This minor artifact does not obscure closure but prevents a higher band score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of bounty hunter tropes with pacifist horticulture is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of "engraved quiet" is a specific, non-obvious angle that heightens stakes and fully commits to its implications. Risk-taking in the quiet climax is coherent and effective.</comment>
