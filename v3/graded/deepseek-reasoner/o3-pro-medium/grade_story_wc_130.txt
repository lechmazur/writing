<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eridian's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("ache nightly, finding its numbers blurred like ink under rain"). His motivation—mathematics of emotion—intensifies under pressure, compelling his inventive experiment. The final endurance (accepting rhythm over closure) is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("contracted from a yawning wound to a measurable curve").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density increases through mosaic, glass eyes, and drip rhythms, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Closure lands with cost ("still painful yet describable") and the final image reweights prior material. Orientation is clear by ~120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is micro-integrated and constrains choices: the cavern orchard's stalactites dictate drip intervals, and the mosaic stone enables discovery. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("dripping stalactites that watered silverleafed pomegranates"). The environment charges the final image ("seeds that might someday find cracks in the ceiling").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: Eridian's experiment (placing glass eyes, translating symbols) deepens pressure and narrows options. Cost is legible ("absence contract from a yawning wound"). One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: ambiguous loss is explored through mathematical metaphor, culminating in a non-literal answer ("loss does not subtract; it hovers"). Subtext operates in image and implication (glass eyes completing broken patterns). No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("pulsed quietly, like pocket hearths"). Purposeful compression and patterned elision (e.g., lyric descriptions) are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; voice modulates with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated ("like missing beats in a lullaby"). Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs. No artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of magic and mathematics feels inevitable and fresh. Specific, grounded choices (taxidermist's glass eyes, mosaic cipher) transform familiar tropes. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative design) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Authenticity of vision is singular.</comment>
