<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies; interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in actions like parsing bird cries. The final choice to tour the coast is earned by prior causality with visible cost—the garden's growth demands story. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the garden's growth reconfigures the battlefield's meaning with undeniable cost—the carriage feels heavy with breeze, not passengers. Orientation is clear by ~120 words; the pattern of ecological renewal is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is purposefully selective and constrains choice—the whitened reef, iron-flat waters, and seed pods all pressure tactics. The jetty and battlefield function as micro-settings that alter moves. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through POV bias, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens—charting nutrient streams via bird calls narrows options and raises cost. The fertilization ritual is a meaningful tightening that reweights the stake with visible cost (waiting motionless). Dominant stake (reclaiming land) is signaled early.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to peace through chlorophyll redrawing battle lines. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., seeds like spent cartridges). Complexity embraces ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure; POV is stable and apt. Diction is consistently poetic and voice-motivated. Purposeful compression (e.g., "narrow vastness") is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density and clear propulsion; figurative language is pattern-taught and functional. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "arrayed in ranks eerily recalling fallen soldiers" verges on explicit) but does not harm closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of ecological renewal and peace treaties; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals (e.g., reef-Latin, barnacle-Greek). Transformation of tropes through grounded choices in character and world.</comment>
