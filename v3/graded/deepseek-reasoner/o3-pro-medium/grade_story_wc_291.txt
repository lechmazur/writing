<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Samara's face-blindness and methodical nature are embodied through concrete actions (numbering breaths, using graphite to trace ripples) and drive key choices. Her emotional breakthrough at the climax is earned by the prior causality of the experiment and her struggle, with a visible cost in the "pinprick behind her eyes" and the blooming of shared remorse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds tightly: the found ribbon leads to the oil tracing, which reveals the heart symbol, triggering the memory of the perfume and the plan. Closure is a decisive change (case solved, empathy awakened) with a resonant reconfiguration in the final image of "the shape of what people share." Cost is legible in the suspects' breakdown and Samara's internal shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quarry is a micro-setting that actively pressures the investigation through its "furrowed hush," mist obscuring vision, and the empty pool that serves as the central clue. The environment constrains choice and charges the final image, with the mist parting at dawn to signal resolution. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Samara's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Samara's agency under the Causal lens: her discovery of the ribbon and execution of the experiment force a tightening that narrows options, culminating in the confrontation. The cost is the emotional risk and cognitive shift required to unify the opposites, felt in the peak beat where she "lanced the tension."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of unifying opposites emerges organically from the plot and character, resisting a tidy moral. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of shared shape, reweighting Samara's entire perception of connection without stating the theme. The empathy experiment premise is fully integrated into the thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature tuned to texture and pattern over faces. The voice is consistent and purposefully compressed, with elision (the captain's refusal to clarify) teaching a pattern of deduction that pays off. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven and carries subtext, as in Mercado's terse commands.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax that accelerates with the investigation. Figurative language ("mist twirling like pale serpents") is pattern-taught and serves atmosphere without muddying clarity. No loops, scaffold, or register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a face-blind portrait artist and a "unifying opposites" mechanic is a singular, non-obvious concept that feels inevitable in hindsight. The bold risk of an empathy-based resolution pays off through specific, grounded choices in the climax, heightening stakes without gimmickry. The quarry setting and cold case backdrop are transformed through this fresh angle.</comment>
