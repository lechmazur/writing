<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Eira's motivation is clear and rooted in her identity as an illustrator seeking raw truth; her final choice to uncage the echo is a credible renunciation that forecloses measured commerce for unmediated art. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., twisting the pendant, drawing the line) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The only minor flaw is a slight diagnostic label in "she understood why it had been jailed," but this is quickly anchored in concrete motive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (freeing the echo) with a resonant reconfiguration (the city's soundscape is permanently altered) and clear cost (stylus cracks, borrowed seconds empty). The accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure escalates through cadence shifts and density increases (e.g., "cadence lurched," "city lights flickered"), culminating in a final image that reweights prior material. Orientation is immediate and taught; causality remains intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the rooftop canal system pressures Eira's choice of transport and the whirlpool courtyard constrains her final action. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("rain began, soft as eraser crumbs"), filtered through her professional bias. The environment charges the closure image, with the stone cage and freed echo reconfiguring the city's auditory landscape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens: Eira's borrowing of time narrows her options and increases cost (city flickers, bell stops). The dominant stake (uncaging the echo) tightens through cadence shifts and environmental pressure. Cost is legible on the page: her stylus cracks and borrowed seconds empty, altering her tools and energy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the conflict between measured commerce (delayed echoes) and raw truth (unmediated art). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: Eira sketches what she hears, embracing freedom over control. Subtext operates in image and implication (e.g., the infinity symbol's recurrence), resisting moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, perceptually biased texture ("rooftops rose like overlapping shelves"). Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure, though a minor template cadence appears in "Roof after roof slipped beneath." POV is stable; elision (e.g., the giant's nature) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. A minor template cadence ("Roof after roof slipped beneath") and a slight register drift ("proto-echo, the ur-sound") prevent a higher score, but clarity and momentum are maintained. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of time-sculpting, echo-hunting, and a slumbering giant is original and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. Risk-taking (e.g., lyrical compression) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
