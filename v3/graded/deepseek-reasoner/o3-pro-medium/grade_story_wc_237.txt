<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Seren's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final choice to bear scars as lanterns is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Minor deduction for slightly over-articulated interiority in "sought insight by revisiting youthful superstitions."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong throughout. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost in "she wished instead to bear them as lanterns." Orientation is immediate, causality tight, with pattern breaks that reweight stakes. No outline sequencing or teleporting props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image magnificently. The floating platform, crystalline tea, and crow quill all pressure tactics and shape closure. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV bias. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in the blood-ink mixture and platform descent. Single meaningful tightening (storm wind rocking platform) forces stance crystallization. Minor deduction for slightly declarative stake setup in "meant today to transform scars into stories."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars rather than statement. The ending offers resonant non-literal answer through image of scars as lanterns. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication. No moralizing or thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with excellent rhythmic control. POV stable and apt, with voice modulation under pressure. Purposeful compression taught early and paid off at closure. Minor filter verb accumulation in "she sensed her scars warming" but not disruptive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion. Figurative language serves pattern and payoff. Minor artifact in "crystallizes when stressed" repetition (appears twice) but does not obscure closure. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally without algorithmic patterns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific verifiable detail creates authenticity. No template plots or near-echoes of famous lines.</comment>
