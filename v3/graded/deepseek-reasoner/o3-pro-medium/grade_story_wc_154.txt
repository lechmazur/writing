<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("my throat tightened with lotus-hearted ache"). The final choice to return the coral and carry the sentence is earned by prior causality, showing a micro-choice under pressure with visible cost. The protagonist's motivation intensifies credibly from passive observation to active, reckless mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost, landing on the final image of the coral's grooves fitting the boy's skin. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through layered notes and imagery. One meaningful cadence shift occurs with the discovery of the acrostic, reweighting the stake. A minor deduction for a slight causality question: the distant shellfire feels more atmospheric than a direct complication of the deciphering action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the POV's specific profession and trauma. The mist-clad atrium and brain coral fragment are charged, specific images. However, the setting, while atmospheric, does not decisively constrain a choice or tactic; it primarily serves as a reflective space. The fragment charges the final image but does not narrow options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens—the act of deciphering the notes deepens the stakes and changes knowledge. The cost is legible in the protagonist's tightened throat and the realization of their true task. A single, meaningful intensification (finding the acrostic) reweights the dominant stake of finding shared meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("Let what was broken remember its pattern") that reweights prior material without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from the coral motif and layered messages, embracing complexity. The final image of the coral fitting the boy's skin acts as a conceptual repricing, answering the central question of regeneration through a charged particular.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and superb rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistent, lyrical, and deeply filtered through the translator's specific worldview. Purposeful elision (e.g., the boy's surgery occurs off-page) is taught and paid off, focusing the narrative on the protagonist's internal reckoning. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional line-level craft with high information density and zero prose artifacts. Figurative language is precise, coherent, and serves the accumulative pressure ("the ache neither clings nor retreats; it simply opens"). Syntax and rhythm are varied and purposeful, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. Read-aloud quality is superb.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of war, healing, and language. The core concept of a translator deciphering messages on a cast feels organic and singular. The brain coral as a motif is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and theme. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
