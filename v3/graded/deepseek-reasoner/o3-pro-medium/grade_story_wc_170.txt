<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV's embodied silence as instrument and Ariste's trembling hands with borrowed heartbeat create profound interior contradiction. Final micro-choice of breath-stealing alignment earns closure through visible cost in the child's laughter.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: pattern of harmony → song → mural escalates through density increase. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "laughter rose like a kite" and forgotten bells.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prism parapet and echoing terrace constrain choice by demanding song-based pigments and breath cadence. Setting charges closure through "rain-sweet fragrance" and mirrors shimmering into being, making environment indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Time pressure ("before bells announced noon") tightens through protagonist's breath control and stolen heartbeat stakes. Escalation driven by agency under accumulative lens, cost visible in child's liberation and temporal suspension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme of possibility versus reflection emerges organically through painted doors and mirrored avenues. Final image of "silent songs awaiting curious ears" offers non-literal resolution that reweights prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with lyrical compression ("dusky harmony," "borrowed heartbeat"). POV stability maintained through embodied observation. Elision taught early through musical pigments pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero prose artifacts; figurative language consistently supports pattern ("like a throat clearing itself"). High information density with sentences advancing multiple layers. Rhythm accelerates with brushstrokes then settles into gentle bells.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of painting, music, and magic with irreplaceable specificity. Risk-taking in temporal manipulation and heartbeat borrowing heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise fully committed and transformed.</comment>
