<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is exceptional, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("turns a splinter beneath skin") and a final renunciation that feels earned. Her embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are consistently specific and reveal a hierarchy of values. The only minor flaw is a slight diagnostic tone in "harvest lessons from loss," but this is quickly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, landing with undeniable cost in the final image of the unfinished carving. The lens holds perfectly from the dense sensory accumulation to the crystallized time shift, which is taught early and pays off. The cost is legible in "Absence, too, can roar" and the visible peace that settles on her.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The skylight, kettle, and carving blank function as micro-settings that actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vividly selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's POV. The workshop's smell of "linseed, sawdust, and a faint musk" perfectly mirrors her internal state and anchors the entire narrative space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation occurs through a decisive cadence shift into crystallized time, reweighting the dominant stake of grief with clear cost. Mara's agency in stepping deeper into memory drives the intensification. The pressure coheres beautifully, forcing a stance crystallization that forecloses simple resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars—the carving, the kettle, the rain—avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to processing loss through art. The concept of "here and gone" is repriced from wound to organizing principle without moralizing, achieved through specific image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure. The lyrical compression is taught early and pays off at closure. Syntax and rhythm masterfully reflect Mara's state, particularly in peak beats like "She would sculpt a stillness loud enough to echo." No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is nearly flawless with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in high-pressure beats. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. One minor overwriting risk in "prismatic and still" is offset by the pattern's payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief, circus lore, and woodcarving feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the crystallized time sequence heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The perspective is memorably specific, transforming familiar tropes of widowhood into a singular artistic stance. Every element serves character and conflict organically.</comment>
