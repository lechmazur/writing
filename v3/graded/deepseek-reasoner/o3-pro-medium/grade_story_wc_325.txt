<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's claustrophobia and motivation to "stand by the unremembered" are concrete, embodied, and compel her high-stakes choice. Her final act of endurance, emerging with the "knowledge marching beside her," is earned by prior causality. A slight deduction for the "tracks invisible things" trait, which feels more declarative than fully dramatized in its constraint on her choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held. Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she emerges, the facility seals, and she feels "no walls, only the promise." Cost is legible in the final image of "invisible footprints dry[ing] into salt." The linkage through sensory and conceptual density is flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional, purpose-driven specificity. The setting is not just vivid but actively pressures choices and charges the closure. The "crashing hush," "sweating brine," and "moonlit water pulse above like a breathing ceiling" are integrated into action and constrain tactics, culminating in the final, indispensable image of the sealed "archive of vapor-bound souls."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift and intensification through the activation of the phase gate. The dominant stake (recovering the unremembered) is tested and reweighted with a profound cost—she gives them "bodies of cloud" but must leave them to drift toward "coastlines still redacted." Agency is clear in her override of safeties.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory and obligation emerges entirely through event and image, resisting moralizing. The final, resonant answer—that standing by the unremembered means literalizing them as mist—is a non-literal, conceptual repricing that grows from the core concept. The "promise" in the final line offers meaningful ambiguity without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, controlled, and consistently filtered through Lira's perceptive bias ("words rubbing their copper jackets raw"). The lyrical, compressed prose is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative drive. No head-hopping; psychic distance is expertly managed, tightening under pressure without losing its textured signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive with high information density. Figurative language ("whales recited equations") is coherent and purposeful. Minor scaffold is detected in adjacent sentences describing the phase gate's effect ("rippled the lab air" / "Mist poured"), causing a slight deduction, but clarity and momentum are never harmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of concept (phase transitions), character (claustrophobic spelunker), and stake (giving memory form). The core premise is fully committed to and followed to its logical, poignant conclusion. The choice to literalize the thematic goal through the phase gate is a specific, non-obvious, and inevitable-feeling risk.</comment>
