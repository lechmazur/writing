<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lis's motivation is clear and embodied ("brow knotted with unfinished resolve," "word jangling in her throat"). Her final choice to wait is a credible micro-action earned by the scene's pressure. The ferry guides are distinct and apply immediate pressure, though their wisdom is slightly archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the lantern lighting unveils Lis's courage, reconfiguring her stance with a clear on-page cost ("felt warmth pool under her ribs"). The linkage from setup to payoff is seamless and inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is a character that constrains choice and charges the final image. The veiled ridgeway, the unlit lantern, and the scatter of collars are not just descriptive but essential to the climax. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a cadence shift into the misty detour and the discovery of the clearing. The dominant stake (finding courage) is tested and deepened. The cost is legible in the final warmth and the sealed ticket.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of courage waiting where leashes break is earned through concrete particulars (the collars, the unlit lantern) and avoids moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("a listening for one's own footfall") that reweights the entire journey.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually rich voice that modulates with emotional intensity ("petals of fog," "heart thrumming"). The elision of the direct route is a taught pattern that pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush and rhythmic with high information density. Minor deduction for slight figurative density in a high-pressure beat ("wrapping Lis in damp vellum"). Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere with clarity and momentum; no loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mythic ferry journey with a deeply internal quest feels fresh and organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, avoiding cliché. The final image is both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
