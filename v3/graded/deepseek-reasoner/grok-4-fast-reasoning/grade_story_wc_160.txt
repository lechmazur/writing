<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is strong with clear, embodied interiority and earned change. His motivation drives the plot, and the final alignment of conflicting impulses is convincingly triggered by the decoded message, with cost legible in his trembling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change with felt cost as Elias reconfigures his approach. Orientation is clear early, and the chain's persistence shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the amphitheater and volcanic elements pressuring choices. The chain and envelope charge the finale, but the environment could constrain tactics more directly for a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency under the causal lens; the decoding deepens conflict, leading to a cost-heavy realization that harmonizes values without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the encrypted compassion concept, offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the finale's image of balance, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyrical, with stable POV and rhythmic control. Minor register elevation in peaks doesn't obscure clarity, but prevents a higher band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax and minimal artifacts. Some metaphorical phrasing like "dappled resolve" is consistent but slightly overwritten in spots.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes engineering and nature with originality; the encrypted compassion concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and lyrical risks heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
