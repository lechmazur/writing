<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is deeply rooted in guilt, with concrete interiority and embodied emotion. His final choice to confess is earned by the vision, showing contradictory impulses. Micro-choices under pressure reveal his values, and the cost is visible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change where Elias decides to confess, with cost legible in "clutched the relic, his steps purposeful."

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the tidal obsidian ridge and clock tower constraining choices and charging the final image.

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes of restoring balance escalate through the vision, driven by Elias's agency to follow the apparition and decide to confess. Cost is unmistakable in the relinquishment of secrecy, narrowing options meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of absolution emerges through particulars like the inscriptions, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elias's confession, reweighting prior guilt with earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature, rhythmic control, and poetic diction consistent under pressure. Elision in the vision is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
