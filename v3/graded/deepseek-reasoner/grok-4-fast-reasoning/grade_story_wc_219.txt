<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's luminous skepticism is consistently embodied through micro-choices like pausing to question the pilgrimage, and her final realization feels earned by the ascent and amber discovery. However, the trait occasionally edges toward label-speak (e.g., "luminous skeptic" repeated), slightly reducing specificity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as Elara's understanding of homecoming fuses with the envoys' presence, cost legible in her smile and "doubts alight." The accumulative lens holds, with footprints and amber building patternately to the revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower and fly amber are vividly specific, with the amber constraining the climax by mirroring alien biology. Sensory details like "metallic tang" and "lichen-draped statues" are filtered through Elara's bias, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens through Elara's active ascent and examination of the amber, culminating in a cost legible as her skepticism transforms to wonder. Agency drives the tightening, though the envoys' convergence introduces a slight external element.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the amber's molecular echo and the convergence, resisting moralizing. The ending reweights homecoming as a "rebellious fusion" without explicit statement, though the final paragraph leans slightly toward summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct with a poetic, perceptual signature ("bronze quiet"). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity, though minor register drift occurs in peak beats (e.g., "chemistry of homecoming" feels academic).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with figurative language serving atmosphere. However, template cadence appears in lists (e.g., "particles of memory and soil fused") and minor synonym churn ("luminous skeptic" / "luminous doubt") slightly dulls momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of first contact with a prehistoric fossil as a mirror for homecoming is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation pays off with a non-obvious, resonant closure.</comment>
