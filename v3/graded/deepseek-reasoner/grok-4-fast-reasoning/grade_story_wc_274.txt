<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior conflict is embodied and concrete, with micro-choices under pressure driving her from duty to defiance. The final decision to transmit the letter is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the treason risk. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously, such as her trembling fingers versus steady resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with cost legible on-page ("knowing the scandal would bloom"). Causal lens holds tightly from discovery to transmission. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the dormant networks constraint shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The library setting pressures choices through its frozen silence, and the cryo-pod object constrains action. Sensory details like "scent of preserved frost" are selective and purposeful, charging the final image of awakened networks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal duty to societal upheaval through Elara's agency. The transmission choice narrows options with cost unmistakable on-page. Under the causal lens, pressure tightens coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge as contraband emerges through events, not statement, with the ending offering a non-literal answer via silent propagation. Subtext operates in gestures like her hesitation before the pod.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; poetic diction remains consistent under pressure. No head-hopping, and elision (e.g., "blink" timeframe) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, though minor overwriting (e.g., "dizzying quiet" repetition) slightly dulls peak beats. No loops or scaffold artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes cryogenics and dissent with freshness; the archivist trope is transformed through specific stakes. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
