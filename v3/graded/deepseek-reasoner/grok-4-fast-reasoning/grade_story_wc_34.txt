<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation to give voice to the overlooked is clear and consistent, driving her from discovery to action. Interiority is embodied through sensory engagement with the ghost's need. The final choice to encode and sing is earned, with cost visible in the ghost's release, though internal contradiction is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; the accumulative/textural lens holds, building through imagery to a resonant reconfiguration at closure. The ghost's emergence carries felt cost, and the flower press constrains tactics, but causality is more thematic than tightly linked, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The misty courtyard and cloud-blossoms create a vivid, atmospheric setting that pressures choices and supplies resources. The flower press acts as a micro-setting that constrains encoding and charges the final image, though some description leans ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes around articulating the ghost's needs escalate through Elowen's agency under the accumulative lens, with density increasing as graffiti blooms. Cost is legible in the transformation, but conflict is mild, relying on internal drive without external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of giving voice to the overlooked emerges organically through Elowen's actions and the ghost's release, with subtext in the graffiti's encoded messages. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively poetic, with a consistent perceptual signature filtering through Elowen's bias. Compression and elision are purposeful, but occasional ornate phrasing may slightly distance immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and varied syntax supporting momentum. Figurative language is consistent and legible, though minor overwriting in peaks like "driftingly alert" occurs without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of balladeer, ghost in code, and graffiti art feels fresh and inevitable, with emotional specificity avoiding tropes. Risk-taking in blending mystical and technological elements heightens stakes coherently.</comment>
