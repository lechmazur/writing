<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her high-stakes choice to use the amulet. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with ennui giving way to a "rare spark" of intrigue. The final endurance is earned, though the internal conflict between boredom and curiosity could be more contradictory in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost: the "void within her had cracked." The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory density and cadence shifts. The spatial mutiny concept pays off cleanly at the ending, reconfiguring her purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, with the prismatic escondite and solar storm creating a rich atmosphere. The setting subtly guides choice by amplifying the amulet's power. However, the environment does not fully constrain a key tactical choice, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with Elowen "weaving intrigue into the chaos" and guiding the magnetic fields. The cost is legible as the curse recoils and the breach seals. The dominant stake (discovering the afterlife) tightens meaningfully through her active manipulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central question of "what happens after goodbye," answered through the non-literal image of a "vast, luminous hush." The final realization reweights prior ennui with transformative purpose, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates effectively in the storm's imagery and the amulet's curse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive signature. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with pressure, though minor register drift occurs in peak beats (e.g., "spatial mutiny, she named it in her mind"). Elision is purposeful and taught, supporting the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in "What if... What if..." and slight synonym churn ("quiet storm," "hushed thunder"). These do not obscure closure, but prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of immortality, dimensional awareness, and a solar storm feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "spatial mutiny" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
