<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative; her embodied actions under pressure, like tracing the arrowhead, reveal character. The final change is earned through prior causality, though internal contradiction is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; under the accumulative lens, closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as Elara achieves navigation without moving. Cost is implied by the restless pulse, but could be stronger on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting constrains choices (echoes can shatter) and charges the final image; sensory details like "towers of bone" are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early; escalation occurs through Elara's agency in appraising the arrowhead via bird patterns, narrowing options under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible but slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like birds and echoes, offering a non-literal answer to navigation and resonance. Subtext is rich without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature; voice remains coherent under pressure, and elision (e.g., bird patterns) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm, but occasional overwriting ("weathered like the layered dust") slightly dulls momentum; no major artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing elements like stone skimming and ethereal navigation; risks in lyrical style heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
