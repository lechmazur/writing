<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion (e.g., hands trembling) and micro-choices under pressure. However, interior contradiction is minimal, and the character leans slightly single-note for high band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost as Elias seals the covenant, a Resonant Reconfiguration under the Accumulative lens. Orientation is clear early, and the tile's constraint shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and POV-filtered, with the magic square tile constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear, escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens, and cost is legible on-page when he is forever altered. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with subtext in imagery and action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature reflective of Elias's mind. Rhythmic control is maintained under pressure, and any elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with good rhythm and propulsion. Minor overwriting (e.g., "dusky harmony" repetition) slightly dulls clarity but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Story offers a fresh synthesis of tropes through specific details, with risk-taking in style that heightens stakes. Emotional truth and originality feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
