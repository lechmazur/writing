<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her arson past, with embodied emotion like "heart burned with volcanic tenderness." Her analytical intuition drives micro-choices, such as tracing the tapestry, and the final vow feels earned by prior causality. However, slight reliance on introspective summary prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as Elara claims the codex, with cost legible in her tears. The accumulative lens holds through pattern buildup, but prose artifacts cap the score. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint of the archive shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid with sensory details like "scent of ancient dust," and it constrains choices, such as the tapestry functioning as a map. The environment charges the final image, but the score is capped due to Q7 issues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's accumulative discoveries, driven by her agency. The cost is unmistakable in the emotional climax, but minor artifacts prevent a higher score under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images like fire and rebirth, with a non-literal resolution in the vow. Subtext is strong, but the score is capped due to global gates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, and perceptual signature is consistent. No dialogue or head-hopping issues, but the voice occasionally leans toward summary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose has good density and rhythm, but repetition of "volcanic tenderness" and label-like phrases such as "analytically intuitive" create minor artifacts. Clarity remains intact, though overwriting is present.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise is fresh with a specific synthesis of arsonist and archive seeker. Tropes are transformed through character depth, but the score is capped due to Q7.</comment>
