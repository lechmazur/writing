<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a closure seeker is clear and consistent, driving her to examine the scar and dig. Interiority is concrete with embodied emotion, though phrases like "seeker of closure" edge toward label-speak. The final choice to tunnel is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in tears and peace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative lens: Elara's insight reweights her survival as a "displaced miracle." Cost is legible in her tears and the hourglass thawing. The plant telepathy, established early, coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tower and garden pressure choices—the plants guide the tunneling, and the opal charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the body (scar) and objects (hourglass) constraining action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (closure about family loss) escalate through Elara's agency under the accumulative lens: she chooses to dig based on plant whispers, leading to discovery. Cost is felt in the emotional wound opening before peace settles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from scars as maps of loss and survival, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the opal's vision, reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature. Voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., time blur) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with varied rhythm and high information density. Some figurative stacking ("meteor hush" repeated) risks ornamentation but doesn't obscure closure. No significant loops or scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of telepathy, scars, and displaced miracles feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image is uniquely charged.</comment>
