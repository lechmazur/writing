<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and conflicted, with embodied emotion under pressure ("reluctance clawed at her"). Her micro-choices, like tripping yet placing elements precisely, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance is earned, though the phrase "graceless beauty" edges toward label-speak in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the nut's discovery triggers a because/therefore sequence leading to closure. Orientation is immediate; closure is a decisive change (birds shift function) with cost felt in Elara's acceptance. Minor deduction for the slightly ornamental frost image in the final sentence, which dilutes focus.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is integral, not decorative: the labyrinth and mechanical birds pressure choices; the nut as a micro-setting object constrains tactics. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("brass wings glinting offhandedly exact"). The environment evolves causally with the intervention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate under time pressure ("mere hours to act"). Agency drives the tightening—Elara's assembly of the pattern narrows options and alters the birds' behavior. Cost is legible in her sweat and determination, and the curse's hold loosening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of reluctant duty vs. freedom emerges organically through action and image (the "cursed orchard," the blueprint's rediscovery). Subtext operates in gestures like the child's wave. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elara's acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Elara's perception. Voice is distinct with rhythmic control ("clumsy ballet of beauty and error"). Some phrases ("danced like awkward lovers") feel slightly ornate for the POV, but elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely precise and propelled, but minor artifacts exist: "offhandedly exact" repeats, creating a slight template cadence. Figurative language is generally effective, though "awkward lovers" is a mixed metaphor. No clarity issues at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of mechanical birds and cursed orchard feels fresh. The blueprint method is ingenious and specific. Risks in tone and structure cohere, and the closure lands without gimmickry. Transformation of tropes through grounded character choices.</comment>
