<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to create the mandala. Her socially perceptive nature is shown through concrete observations, and her final action feels earned. However, some emotions like "lilac unease" lean slightly toward decorative abstraction rather than fully embodied contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the group finds stillness, with cost felt in the lingering unease. The accumulative lens holds strong, building through pattern density. Orientation is clear early, and the tile flake's discovery provides a causal anchor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto setting actively constrains choices through its acoustics and mist, while the sand and tile flake become tactile tools that charge the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposefully woven into action, supporting the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (finding meaning in chaos) escalate through Elara's agency in building the mandala, which absorbs group tensions. Under the accumulative lens, density increase reweights the stake with cost (fragile peace). One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mandala's creation, offering a non-literal answer to unlearning without moralizing. Subtext operates through imagery like the fractured circle, though the concept of "emergent hush" borders on thematic echo in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Elara's poetic perception, with distinct voice control. Dialogue is minimal but functional; prose rhythm supports the accumulative mode. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense with purposeful imagery, but slight overwriting in peaks (e.g., "lilac unease" repetition) creates minor texture drag. No major artifacts harm closure; sentence variety generally supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of unlearning, mandala, and grotto acoustics feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric style pays off with a coherent vision. Tropes are transformed through specific details like the tile flake's role.</comment>
