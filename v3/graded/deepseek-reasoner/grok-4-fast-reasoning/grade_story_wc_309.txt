<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her choices; interiority is concrete, with embodied emotion (e.g., "tears froze on her cheeks"). The final awakening is earned through persistence, with visible cost. However, contradictory impulses are not deeply explored in scene, limiting peak score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elowen realizes the sacred in simplicity; cost is legible in the emotional awakening. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with the keystone as a persistent constraint. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with sensory details (e.g., "frost etched crystalline filigrees") integrated into action. The icebound spire and keystone constrain choices and charge the final image, elevating the score beyond mere description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, and escalation is driven by Elowen's agency (unstrapping, mist walking). Under the accumulative lens, density increases toward closure with felt cost. However, external conflict is minimal, relying on internal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the keystone's glow representing organic wonder. The ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is strong, though the final paragraphs verge on explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction matching Elowen's perspective. Rhythm controls pressure, and elision (e.g., mist walking) is taught and paid off. No dialogue, so those elements are N/A.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid, but some overwriting occurs (e.g., "brilliant dimness" repeated). Figurative language is patterned but occasionally heavy, though clarity remains. No major artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of magic and automation, with specific details grounding it. Turns feel earned, but the concept isn't highly innovative. Emotional truth elevates it beyond template.</comment>
