<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's blithe nature is consistent and motivates his puzzle-solving, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses under pressure. The final realization is earned, with cost in the understanding of fluid intentions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a conceptual repricing with felt cost as Elias reweights intentions; accumulative/textural lens holds through patterned revelation. Orientation is clear early, and causality links discovery to decoding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and tapestry fragment constrain choices and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes in discovering intentions escalate through Elias's agency in decoding; cost is legible in the dawn realization that forecloses static views. Accumulative lens supports deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of fluid intentions emerges organically from the tapestry decoding, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in echoes and chess motifs resists tidiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., chess game) is taught and paid off. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid but occasionally overwritten with dense figurative language; some repetition ("blithe," "velveteen") feels pattern-taught rather than artifact. Rhythm supports accumulation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cemetery gardener and historical puzzle feels inevitable; specific details transform tropes, and risk in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
