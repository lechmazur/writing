<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and drives the plot, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. However, interior contradiction is limited, and the character leans slightly toward one-dimensional charm without deep flaws, reducing complexity for high-band eligibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands with cost (sirens wail, defiance solidifies) under a causal lens that holds strong. Orientation is anchored early, and the plot advances through Elias's actions, with the warp serving as a persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, but the greenhouse setting, while atmospheric, does not fully constrain choices or charge the final image to meet the 9+ test, capping the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start, and escalation is driven by Elias's agency (planting, warping) under the causal lens, with cost legible through the drone's retreat and distant sirens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of defiance emerges organically through actions and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer via the garden's symbolic rebellion without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptual signature that remains controlled under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic variation. No significant loops or figurative muddle harm closure, though slight overwriting exists in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes dystopia, bio-alchemy, and rebellion in a fresh, inevitable way, with risk-taking in voice and structure heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
