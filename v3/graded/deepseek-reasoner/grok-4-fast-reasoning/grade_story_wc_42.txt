<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("luminous ache") is clear and consistent, driving his actions under pressure. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions like "trembling hands." The final choice to restructure the clock is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his "bittersweet glow of achievement." However, minor lack of contradictory impulses in scene prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: the probe launches, and Elias's heart aches with fulfillment. The causal lens holds tightly, with the clock's spin as a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and the leaf's sound pays off at closure. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and pressures choices: the observatory's tremors and atrium with the falling leaf constrain Elias's actions. Sensory details are purposeful, filtered through his POV. The environment charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (launch success) escalate through tremors and clock malfunction, driven by Elias's agency. Cost is legible in the lost opportunity avoided. One meaningful tightening occurs when the leaf inspires the fix. Minor deduction for reliance on internal conflict over external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (harnessing the ephemeral) emerges organically through the leaf's sound and clock fix, offering a non-literal answer at the end. Subtext is rich, with no moralizing. Earned epiphany reweights prior material, but slight abstraction prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction consistent under pressure. Perceptual signature is strong, but occasional dense figurative language causes minor register drift in peak beats, though clarity remains.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, but slight overwriting in figurative language (e.g., "luminous ache" repetition) introduces minor artifacts, though closure is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Concept is fresh and specific, with risk-taking in poetic synthesis. The leaf sound as method feels inevitable in hindsight. Transformation of tropes is grounded, but proximity to familiar motifs limits higher innovation.</comment>
