<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies through embodied micro-choices; her internal conflict between past drama and present humility is concretely shown, and the final renunciation of spectacle is earned with visible cost in tears and resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; accumulative lens holds with patterns building to a conceptual repricing closure where cost is legible in "tears welled as realization dawned"; the greenhouse decay persistently shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensory, with the storm-damaged greenhouse constraining choices and mirroring internal decay; the butterfly dust as micro-setting charges the final image by enabling the pivotal overlay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes center on Elara's internal conflict; escalation is driven by her agency in collecting and mapping dust, culminating in a cost-legible shift under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of gradual change emerges organically through particulars like decay and dust patterns; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a scientific-poetic perceptual signature; elision is purposeful, and rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high density and varied rhythm with no loops or artifacts; figurative language is purposeful, though minor purple hints prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic and earthly scales feels inevitable; risk-taking in quiet internal arc heightens stakes without gimmickry, and specificity avoids template plots.</comment>
