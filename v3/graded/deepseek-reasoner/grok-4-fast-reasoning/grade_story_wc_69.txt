<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in past trauma, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The students have distinct backgrounds that inform their arcs, and the final harmony feels earned through gradual unlearning. However, some student transformations are slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with cost legible in Elias's "expectantly resigned" stance. The accumulative lens holds, with shards over weeks teaching a pattern that pays off. Orientation is clear early, and the mosaic structure (Track B) is legible without harming causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like "crimson drapes pooling like spilled wine," and the library/zither constrain choices by framing the lessons. However, the environment doesn't actively pressure tactics beyond atmosphere, capping the score below the 9-band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (unlearning hatred) escalate under the accumulative lens through the method of "subtracting noise," driven by Elias's and the students' agency. Cost is visible in their vocal transformations, but the escalation lacks a sharp reversal, relying on gradual density increase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars like the zither and vocal exercises, with subtext in gestures and silence. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the "singular, resonant whole," avoiding moralizing. Minor explicit echoes in phrases like "vanishing arts" are outweighed by resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elias, with a distinct lyrical voice and rhythmic control. Dialogue is minimal but natural, and elision (e.g., time jumps) is taught and paid off. Slight register elevation in peaks doesn't disrupt coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with strong rhythm, but figurative language occasionally overloads beats (e.g., "forgotten bookmarks" simile). No major loops or scaffolds, and closure remains clear. Overwriting triggers a minor deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of "subtracting noise" for harmony feels fresh and inevitable, transforming familiar tropes through specific details. Risks in lyrical style heighten stakes without gimmickry, though the theme of unlearning hatred is well-trodden.</comment>
