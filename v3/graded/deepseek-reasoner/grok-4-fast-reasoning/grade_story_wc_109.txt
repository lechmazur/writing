<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's obsession is a clear, consistent motivator that drives all on-page action. Her internal state is rendered through specific, embodied perception ("bare feet crunching over shards of slate"), and her final, sated smile is an earned micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The single POV is deeply characterized, with no diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the map is begun and her obsession is sated, with cost felt in the final image of the winking star and settling hush. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through summarized silences. A slight ambiguity in whether the lens is purely accumulative or hybrid with causal elements prevents a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ridge fort setting is not just atmospheric but actively pressures Elara's choices, constraining her to a specific vantage point and amplifying the "marbled hush." The flaking gold booklet is a micro-setting object that charges the final image as its flakes drift away. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through her particular obsession.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, as she actively summarizes each new silence to build her map. The cost is the passage of time and the winking out of the final star, which is legible on the page. The stakes (mapping the endless night) are signaled early and meaningfully tightened through her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of mapping silence, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The final image of the begun map is a profound thematic statement earned through concrete particulars, avoiding any moralizing or abstract summary. The integration of concept, character, and action is seamless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature wholly aligned with Elara's oracle nature. The prose rhythm modulates perfectly with the emotional intensity of her task. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the POV is stable, confident, and deeply immersive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly effective, with strong rhythmic control. Minor deductions for slight overwriting in phrases like "ambered hush—the preserved silences of ancient prophecies, trapped like insects in golden resin," which, while beautiful, slightly slows momentum. No loops, scaffolds, or clarity issues; the closure image remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core concept of mapping silence through its summarization is strikingly original and executed with full commitment. The synthesis of character (oracle), object (booklet), method (summarizing silence), and concept (ambered hush) feels inevitable and deeply ingenious, transforming familiar tropes into a singular, memorable vision.</comment>
