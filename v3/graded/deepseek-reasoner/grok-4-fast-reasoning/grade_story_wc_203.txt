<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, driving key choices like engaging with the ghosts. Interiority is concrete, with embodied emotions (e.g., "calloused hands steady despite the chill"). The final renunciation—sharing the truth to lift the ghosts' burden—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as they fade.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias uncovers the embezzlement truth, reconfiguring the ghosts' plight with cost ("weightless burden lifted"). Causal lens holds tight from observation to discovery. Orientation is clear early, though minor self-correction lines ("Wait, that's over—adjusting") slightly dent structural polish without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details (e.g., "dust motes danced in his light") filtered through Elias's professional bias. The environment constrains choice—dust patterns and ceiling cracks direct tactics—and the mainspring barrel charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (discovering hidden truths) escalate through Elias's agency, like analyzing dust and engaging ghosts. Pressure tightens causally, culminating in a trade-off where sharing the burden has legible cost. Agency drives escalation under the causal lens, though the climax feels slightly rapid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (secrets and burdens) emerges organically through particulars like the dust patterns and ghosts' eyes. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures (ghosts' silent circling), but minor exposition in the ledgers slightly reduces ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature. However, self-correction lines ("No, recount properly") introduce unintended voice slippage, weakening consistency under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate; prose rhythm is otherwise controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and concise, but artifact lines (e.g., "Wait, that's over—adjusting") create paraphrase loops that disrupt momentum, especially near closure. Figurative language is generally effective, though these scaffolds incur a −0.5 deduction for obscuring peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis (elevator tech/ghosts/carnival) transformed through specific details. Turns feel earned, and risk-taking in tone heightens stakes. The combination is organic and indispensable, with a bold stance that avoids template plots.</comment>
