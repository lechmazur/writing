<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values. The final decision to hunt the hunters is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his scarred resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly; closure is a decisive change with felt cost as Elias moves from obsession to action. Orientation is anchored early, and the geode crystal's revelation drives a tight because/therefore linkage to the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating observatory and geode crystal constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through Elias's bias. The setting pressures tactics through the cooling circuit breakers, enhancing urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elias's agency under the causal lens, from hunting to awakening to vengeance, with cost legible in his hollow laugh and resolved movement. The dominant stake tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with subtext in the crystal's symbolism; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of a ripple, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature that reflects Elias's mindset. The poetic prose maintains consistency under pressure, and any elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, but slight overwriting and repetition of phrases like "bleak exhilaration" create minor artifacts without obscuring closure. Information density is high, and propulsion remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and risk-taking, with a non-obvious synthesis of sci-fi and grief; the transformation of tropes through specific details feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
