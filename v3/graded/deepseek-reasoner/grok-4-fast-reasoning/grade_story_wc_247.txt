<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions like "joyful sorrow." Micro-choices, such as using the camera to frame silence, reveal his values. Lir serves as a effective catalyst, though his enigmatic nature borders on stock. The final change is earned with visible cost when Elias feels seen.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as Elias translates silence into music, mending a "fracture in his soul." The accumulative lens holds, building through sensory density. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, with Lir's arrival driving the turn. Cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The harbor setting is vividly sensory and constrains choices, pressuring Elias's actions and charging the finale. Details like "moon-kissed water" are filtered through POV, integrating with the theme. It shapes the climax when the silence is mapped onto the environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens through density increases in mapping silence. Elias's agency drives the disruption, with cost felt as he hums and gains connection. The fishermen's reaction adds external pressure, but the core conflict is internal and well-handled.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events, with subtext in gestures and silence.

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with poetic diction consistent under pressure. Sign language replaces dialogue effectively, maintaining subtext. Minor purple phrases exist but do not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical with good rhythm, but some overwriting like "shimmered like a forgotten dream" slightly densifies figurative language. No major artifacts affect closure; propulsion remains clear. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements.</comment>
