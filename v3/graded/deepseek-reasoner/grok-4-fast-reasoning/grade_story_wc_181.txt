<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, but occasional told traits like "bewildered" slightly reduce specificity. Her final resolve is earned through the visions, with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (accumulative/textural dominant) holds; closure is a conceptual repricing with cost (disquiet and resolve). Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight, though visions arrive somewhat conveniently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the astral orchard and bathroom constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (forbidden knowledge vs. madness) escalate under accumulative lens through visions that deepen knowledge; agency is clear when Elara presses the cameo, with legible cost in her disquiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear inheritance emerges organically through events and images, with subtext in the cameo's blankness as a mirror. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct poetic voice; diction and rhythm are controlled under pressure. Purposeful elision and perceptual signature enhance clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush but occasionally overwritten (e.g., "brightened disquiet" risks mixed metaphor), with minor synonym churn. However, rhythm and clarity propel the story without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable; risks with nonlinear structure heighten stakes. The pistachio shell and inheritance concept are transformed through specific details.</comment>
