<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotions and micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to share light feels earned, though internal conflict is somewhat tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with felt cost from past loss; accumulative lens holds strong, anchored early with clear causality from memories to action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices (navigating grotto) and charging the final image; sensory details are selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in her isolation; dominant internal conflict tightens meaningfully, though external pressure is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through symbols and events, with subtext in memories; ending offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, but some lines edge toward explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice; perceptual signature is consistent, and elision (e.g., memory triggers) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush but occasionally overwritten with minor figurative density (e.g., "zephyr bloom" repetition); rhythm varies, though some loops slightly dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Story offers a fresh synthesis of familiar tropes through specific character choices; risk-taking in lyric style heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
