<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion; however, limited on-page internal conflict prevents higher marks, though her final choice is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands decisively with cost under a coherent accumulative lens; the unraveling truth and Elara's decision to share the echo are causally earned through the button-cataloging method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and specific imagery create a rich atmosphere; the amber warehouse charges the final image but does not intensely constrain choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency in cataloging buttons, with a meaningful tightening that narrows options and a legible cost at the climax under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of shared wisdom emerges organically from events and images, with a resonant, non-literal answer at the end that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stable single POV with a distinct poetic voice that reflects Elara's perception; rhythmic control and perceptual signature are consistent, though no dialogue is present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dense, rhythmic prose with high information density and varied syntax; minor poetic excess in figurative language slightly burdens momentum but does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of elements feels inevitable and fresh, with risk-taking in the premise that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
