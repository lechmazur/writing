<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her traits; interiority is concrete with embodied emotion (e.g., trembling fingers, tears). The final realization—linking Theo's unused love to her own regrets—is earned through psychometry, with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a conceptual repricing via Elara's vow to free the love, with cost legible in her tears. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory details and visions; orientation is anchored early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (e.g., dust motes, flickering bulb) and constrains choice—the projection booth and film strip are essential to the discovery. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (finding unused love) escalate under the accumulative lens through intensified visions and lyrics. Elara's agency (psychometry) drives the deepening, with cost unmistakable in her emotional response.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars like goodbye letters and negative spaces, offering a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext is rich in imagery and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature that reflects Elara's spatial imagination. Rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with no loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, clarity maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing crystal gazing psychometry with cinematic nostalgia. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without gimmickry; emotional truth feels inevitable.</comment>
