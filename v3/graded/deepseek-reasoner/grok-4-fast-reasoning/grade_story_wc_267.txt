<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in trauma, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. His final endurance (remaining) is earned by prior causality, showcasing contradictory impulses—silence as both healing and cost. The pocketing of the bolt is a decisive act with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elias accepts silence's price, with cost legible in "guarding their fragile thaw." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through imagery; the bolt as a persistent constraint shapes the final image. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress setting constrains choices through isolation and silence, charging the final image with "frostbitten hope." Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's POV, such as the "frost-rimed windows" mirroring internal stasis. The staircase and bolt function as micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (cost of safety) escalate via Elias's agency in discovering the bolt, deepening his understanding under the Accumulative lens. The choice to pocket it narrows options and carries felt cost, foreclosing escape. Pressure coheres through the storm's howl and memory triggers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images like the bolt and "silent choir," resisting moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer—silence as a "vow"—that reweights prior material without abstraction. Subtext operates in gestures (pocketing the bolt) and implications.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and close to Elias, with a distinct perceptual signature ("seraphically mundane routine"). Poetic diction remains consistent under pressure, and elision (e.g., choir backstory) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("frostbitten hope") is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "unpardonable silence pressing heavier") slightly reduces propulsion but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of silence, trauma, and frozen sanctuary feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking in a quiet, accumulative structure. Tropes are transformed through specific details (e.g., silent choir's gestures). Emotional truth anchors originality without gimmickry.</comment>
