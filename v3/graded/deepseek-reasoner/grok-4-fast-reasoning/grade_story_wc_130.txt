<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation is deeply rooted in ambiguous loss, driving her quest to quantify emotion. Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure, such as tracing the bark and placing the eyes. The final insight—that loss expands wholeness—is earned through the ritual, showing credible endurance with felt cost. No diagnostic label-speak; contradictions (grief vs. hope) act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words (Elowen in cavern orchard at night). Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through descriptive layers to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with cost: "her heart lighter" as loss is redefined, and the stone/eyes constraint shapes the final image. Causality is tight, with the ritual leading inevitably to insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific—stalactites weeping, luminous fruit—and constrains choice: the mosaic stone's patterns guide the dovetailing action. Sensory details (dripping water, silver moonlight) are purposeful and filtered through Elowen's POV. The cavern orchard charges the final image, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding grief) escalates under the accumulative lens through Elowen's agency in the ritual. Pressure tightens as light threads emerge, forcing a trade-off: acceptance of loss's integral role. Cost is legible in the reconfiguration of her emotional calculus. No coincidence; escalation is driven by protagonist choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—glass eyes, stone patterns—without moralizing. Subtext operates through implication (e.g., eyes "seeing beyond the veil"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: loss as a "new term" in life's equation. Earned wisdom arises from concrete experience, avoiding platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct lyrical voice. Perceptual signature is selective (noticing crystalline tears, fractal echoes). Syntax and rhythm vary purposefully, heightening pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., the vanished companion's details) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density advancing story and atmosphere. Figurative language ("stalactites wept crystalline tears") is consistent and voice-motivated. No loops or scaffold issues; sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the scene's emotional cadence. Minor overwriting risk in peak beats, but clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief, magic, and mathematics feels inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific details (taxidermist's eyes, cavern orchard). Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration is bold and coherent, rooted in character particulars. No derivative echoes; authenticity of vision is strong.</comment>
