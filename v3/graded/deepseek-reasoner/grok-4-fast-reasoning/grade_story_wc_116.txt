<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper's motivation to "witness change without judgment" is profoundly clear and consistent, compelling his journey. His serene detachment is embodied in micro-choices, such as carefully unfolding the swan. However, his emotional state remains largely static, lacking the contradictory impulses or internal conflict that would elevate the characterization under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure coheres beautifully, moving from observation to transformative action. The closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), landing with undeniable cost: the surrender of the old library for an eternal, silent vigil. The origami swan's discovery and use provide a clean, taught causal mechanism for the transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is not merely described but is the engine of the story. The overgrown library actively crumbles, pressuring the keeper's choice to leave, and the obsidian refuge's "regenerative silence" is the concrete, tactile answer to that decay. Sensory details are lush, selective, and wholly integrated with the POV's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving witness) is clear, and pressure escalates texturally through the intensifying decay of the library. The keeper's agency in following the swan's instructions provides a meaningful tightening. However, the conflict is largely external and environmental; the lack of a significant internal cost or trade-off during the escalation prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of setting, character, and object. The core concept of "regenerative silence" is the story's thesis, answered not through statement but through the keeper's final, earned state of eternal observation. The ending image reweights the entire narrative without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly calibrated to the keeper's detached perspective. The prose maintains a consistent, measured rhythm that evokes the "drift of untold seasons." Purposeful compression and elision, such as "Hours stretched into days," serve the accumulative drive lens without harming clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("regenerative silence that healed without words") that slightly dulls immediacy, and a subtle template cadence in lists of decay ("ivy claiming pages... air hung heavy..."). The closure beat, however, remains crystal clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a chronicle keeper, an origami guide, and a volcanic stone refuge is fresh and feels inevitable. The specific, grounded choice to make the swan's instructions "cryptic folds" rather than a literal map elevates it beyond a simple trope. Points are withheld as the core arc of seeking silence is a familiar literary concept, though executed superbly here.</comment>
