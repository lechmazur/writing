<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices like clutching the mirror shard revealing hierarchy of values. Thorne's "sincerely insincere" trait adds complexity. The final unhooking action is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as the wind carries doubt away.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara unhooks the cloak, with cost legible in the wind carrying it away. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and causality tightens through the chimes' interpretation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice: the lighthouse balcony and wind chimes pressure Elara's realization. Sensory details (salty tang, rusted hooks) are selective and POV-filtered. The environment charges the final image with the chimes' affirmation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (certainty vs. nuance) escalate under accumulative lens through Thorne's deciphering, driven by Elara's agency. Cost is felt in the cloak's release, but the escalation lacks one decisive tightening, slightly limiting peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through symbols (chimes, mirror) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the "nuance settled in," reweighting prior material through earned experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure. Dialogue advances plot with subtext ("unhook that cloak"). No head-hopping or elision issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic variety and high density without loops. Minor overwriting in phrases like "sincerely insincere" slightly dulls peak beats, but clarity and propulsion remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts (conscience for hire, cloak of doubt) feels inevitable. Specific details (shipwreck chimes) avoid tropes, and risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
