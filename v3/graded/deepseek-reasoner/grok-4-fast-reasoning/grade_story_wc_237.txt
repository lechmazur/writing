<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to transform scars into stories is clear and drives the narrative. Her internal conflict and growth are embodied through the crystal trait, with micro-choices under pressure revealing hierarchy of values. The final change is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as crystals dissolve. However, contradictory impulses could be more simultaneous rather than sequential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a decisive change as Elara completes the transformation rune, crystals dissolving into dust with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory density. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the platform's sanctity persists as a constraint. Cost is legible at "the crystals dissolving into luminous dust."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective, with the floating rock platform and crow quill charging the final image. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV, such as "the world below churned with distant thunder." The quill constrains choice by being the tool for inscription, and the platform's isolation amplifies the ritual's sanctity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake of internal transformation escalates through Elara's agency in writing the runes, under accumulative lens. Cost is legible as crystals prick and soften, narrowing options. Pressure coheres from stress to release, with no coincidence resolving conflict. The shedding action forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through storytelling emerges organically from events, with subtext in superstitions like the crow quill. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, as scars become "tales etched in eternity." Earned through concrete particulars, such as the ink mixed with tears.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, voice consistent and poetic. Elision is taught early, such as "saturated hush," and paid off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural, with elder's silence carrying subtext. Rhythm controls pressure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and varied rhythm, with sentences advancing story efficiently. Minor overwriting in dense metaphors, like "lightning forked like angry veins," but no loops or scaffold obscuring clarity. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, supporting propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of rune magic, floating setting, and crystal stress feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific character choices, such as using superstitions for healing. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry, and closure reweights prior material.</comment>
