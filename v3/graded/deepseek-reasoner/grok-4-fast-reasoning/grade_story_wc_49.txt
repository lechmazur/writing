<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation is clear and consistent, driving the narrative with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. However, the characterization lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene, preventing a higher score despite strong interiority and earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as sacred practices are restored, felt cost in the villagers' renewal and land's healing. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with the harvest moon's constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is clear early, and causality is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The verdant arbor and vine tendril constrict choices and charge the final image, with sensory details filtered through Elowen's POV. Setting is integral to the climax, meeting the 9+ test by pressuring the alignment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elowen's agency in weaving songs, under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the tapestry's transformative pulse. The dominant stake of healing the land tightens meaningfully, driven by protagonist choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of renewal through tradition emerges organically from events, with subtext in the golden stories, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer, but lacks profound ambiguity, slightly limiting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with whimsical, poetic diction consistent under pressure. Elision is purposeful, and the perceptual signature is strong, though dialogue is minimal but natural when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with minimal artifacts. Some figurative language leans purple but remains coherent; propulsion is clear, and closure is undulled by line-level issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of tinkerer, vine tendril, and forgotten songs feels fresh and inevitable, with emotional specificity. Risk-taking is moderate but effective, though not highly transformative of tropes.</comment>
