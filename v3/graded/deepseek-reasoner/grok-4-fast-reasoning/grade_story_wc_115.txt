<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is strong with clear, consistent motives rooted in reckless exploration and skepticism. Interiority is concrete and embodied, such as "heart pounding" and the thrill of discovery. The final realization of his parallel guilt is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as his secret surges up. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. thrill) act simultaneously in scene, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change where Elias confronts his own guilt, with cost legible in "forever altered." The causal drive lens holds tightly, with events linked because/therefore (e.g., exploration leads to valve find, radio calls, ghost encounter). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the valve wheel acts as a persistent constraint shaping the final image. Cost is unmistakable at the ending beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (e.g., "scent of rust," "walls seemed to breathe") that reflect Elias's POV. The tunnel and beaded valve wheel constrain choices and charge the closure, as the wheel burns in his pocket during the revelation. The environment pressures tactics and mirrors internal states, satisfying the 9+ test by actively shaping the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes (finding the swallowed truth) escalate through Elias's agency under the causal lens, from exploration to ghost encounter. The confession forces a tightening that narrows options, with cost felt in his parallel guilt. Agency is evident in his active choices, and the cost is legible on the page, meeting the 9+ test for driven escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (guilt, truth, echoes) emerges organically through events like the ghost's confession and Elias's realization, without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, such as the valve wheel's warmth symbolizing shared folly. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal reweighting through the final image, though it leans slightly toward explicit parallelism in the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("like a hesitant thought"). Voice modulates under pressure, and elision (e.g., radio calls) is taught and pays off. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though minimal. The 9+ test is met with rhythmic control and no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but minor overwriting occurs (e.g., "drowsy alertness" repeated). Figurative language is generally coherent, and propulsion is strong without loops obscuring closure. A slight register drift in peak beats prevents a higher score, but clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story synthesizes ghost lore and psychological guilt in a fresh, non-obvious way, with tropes transformed through specific details like the valve wheel. Risk-taking in blending supernatural and personal elements heightens stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
