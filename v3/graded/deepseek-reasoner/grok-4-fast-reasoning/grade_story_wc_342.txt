<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's face blindness is a consistent and driving trait, with clear motivation that intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict between acceptance and chafing against limits is embodied through concrete actions, like tracing the coin's grooves. The final choice to incorporate the book's wisdom is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the impending demolition. Quick test satisfied: contradictory impulses act in scene, and the renunciation/endurance is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within 120 words, and closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara completes the mural, feeling expanded limits. The accumulative lens holds, with patterns (fractals, indentations) building to revelation. Cost is legible in the "distant hum of approaching demolition crews" and the oak's "quiet gratitude." Quick test satisfied: closure with cost, lens holds, and persistent constraint (face blindness) shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is vividly rendered with sensory details like "scent of aged paper" and "light filtering through knotholes," constraining choices when the grain reveals the safe. Setting pressures the narrative through the imminent demolition, charging the final image. Quick test satisfied: environment (the tree) constrains a choice (finding the safe) and charges the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving the library's spirit) escalates through the discovery of the book and the approaching crews, driven by Elara's agency. Under the accumulative lens, density increases with fractal patterns, reweighting stakes with cost legible in the mural's completion against time. Quick test satisfied: escalation driven by agency, with cost unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of discovering limits as infinite exploration emerges through events and images, like the fractal maps, without direct statement. Subtext operates in gestures (tracing indentations) and the final mural, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Quick test satisfied: ending reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on textures and forms. Voice is poetic yet consistent, modulating with emotional intensity. No head-hopping or dialogue issues. Quick test satisfied: distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. No significant loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; phrases like "fractally precise" are thematic and consistent. Quick test satisfied: zero loops, clear propulsion, and no obscurity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept synthesizes face blindness, fractal art, and preservation in a fresh, non-obvious way. Tropes are transformed through specific details, like the coin's indentations, and emotional truth anchors the narrative. Quick test satisfied: specific synthesis feels inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>
