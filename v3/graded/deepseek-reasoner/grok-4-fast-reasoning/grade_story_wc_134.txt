<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied emotion under pressure, but her internal conflict during the possession is swift, lacking deep contradictory impulses in scene, though the final change is earned by her hubris.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure lands with a decisive change and felt cost (loss of self), driven by causal linkages; the inferred causal lens holds, and the cave's constraint shapes the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is vividly specific and pressures choices, with the cave and pearl charging the final image; sensory details are purposeful and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency (reaching for the pearl), with a clear cost legible on the page; pressure tightens coherently under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer on ambition and cost; no moralizing, and subtext is strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature; no head-hopping, though minor register elevation occurs under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and no significant artifacts; figurative language is coherent, though "bright darkness" risks mild contradiction but serves tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The concept offers a fresh synthesis of clairvoyance and cosmic horror, with specific details transforming tropes; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
