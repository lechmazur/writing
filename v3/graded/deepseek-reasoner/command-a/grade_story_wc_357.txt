<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, intensifying under pressure. Her embodied emotions ("heart raced," "clutched tightly") and micro-choices (steering, anchoring, approaching the stone) reveal character. The final choice to press the arrow tip is earned by prior causality, though the internal contradiction under peak stress could be slightly more pronounced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong causal drive lens holds throughout. Closure is a decisive change (resilience restored) with clear, felt cost (the echoes were fading, the core weakening). The arrow tip's projection provides a necessary because/therefore linkage, and the final act of pressing it into the stone is a motivated, on-page resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is not just vivid but essential, actively constraining choices (navigating by river flow, gravity inversion) and charging the final image (the grove, the monolithic stone). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional priorities as a pilot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens (following the map, navigating to the grove). The stake (finding the source of resilience) tightens meaningfully with the discovery of the fading echoes, creating palpable cost. The final choice to act carries visible consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges organically from the plot and setting, resisting direct statement. The final image of the "planet's song" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The connection between planetary and personal resilience is subtly effective, though the thematic depth is slightly more implied than fully explored in this short form.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature attuned to the environment's "whispers." The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the action. There is no dialogue to evaluate, but the internal voice is coherent and specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery ("veins of bioluminescent moss," "fruit that shimmered like stars"). Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements of story and atmosphere. No noticeable loops, artifacts, or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of sci-fi and ecological fantasy feels fresh and specific. The core concept (echoes as planetary memory stored in flora) is an ingenious, non-obvious angle that is fully committed to and integrated with character and plot, making the story's logic feel inevitable.</comment>
