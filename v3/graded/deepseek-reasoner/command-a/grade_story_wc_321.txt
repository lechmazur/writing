<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's resilient positivity is a consistent, embodied trait that drives her high-stakes choice to enter the rift. However, her internal contradiction is underdeveloped; her unwavering demeanor lacks the on-page contradictory impulses that would elevate the characterization under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (time reset) with a clear, on-page cost: Mara collapses, weakened. The causal lens holds, with her actions (entering the rift, using the hourglass) directly causing the resolution. The transient's warning complicates but does not resolve the central conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The spectral grotto and the hourglass are vividly rendered and purposefully selective, filtering through Mara's professional focus. The hourglass constrains choice and charges the final image, but the grotto's rules of reality bending could be more tactilely integrated into the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: Mara's decision to enter the rift is a major tightening that narrows options. The cost of her physical strain is legible on the page, though the stakes for the passengers could feel more viscerally immediate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (endurance, transience) emerges organically from the central conflict and the final image of Mara, changed but unbroken. The empty-then-filled hourglass offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the cost of intervention without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, controlled texture. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like "ardent ferry deckhand," which feels slightly external to Mara's immediate, embodied perception in a crisis. Dialogue is functional but brief.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with vivid imagery. A minor scaffold artifact exists: the phrase "resiliently positive" is used as a label in the first paragraph and later summarized as "resilience unwavering," which slightly dulls immediacy through repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a time-bending mystery with a grounded, determined protagonist feels fresh and specific. The concept is fully committed to, and the resolution through a time reset grown from the established hourglass object feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
