<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies credibly, compelling her to reveal herself and declare the gathering. Her embodied emotion ("heart pounding") and micro-choice to step into the moonlight reveal character under pressure. The final earned stasis, walking away with peace, is scaled to the length and has a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost (the community's resolve, the elder's offer). A causal drive lens holds: the widow's discovery forces a new tactic, leading to the gathering which reconfigures their identity. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. A persistent constraint (sanctions) shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("wind whispered secrets through cracked tiles"). The terra-cotta arbor and silver bell are recurring objects that charge the final image. However, the arbor does not actively constrain a choice, only hosts one, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens: Mara's choice to reveal herself to the widow is a meaningful tightening that narrows her options and forces a new, public tactic. The cost of this shift is legible in the community's transformation from isolated survivors to a unified "family."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of intergenerational support emerges from events and images (the bell, the gathering, the elder's offer) rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the bell and the community's renewed resolve, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture ("amplified quiet"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. A minor register drift occurs with the slightly elevated phrase "amplified quiet," which, while effective, feels a touch outside the POV's immediate lexicon in that moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive with high information density. Rhythm is controlled and varies effectively. A single, minor loop exists in the description of the community's state ("hollowed" / "dwindling"), but it does not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sanctions period with a community-building arc feels organic and specific. The concept is fresh, though the anonymous donor trope is well-worn; it is transformed through the specific, grounded choice of the bell and the focus on intergenerational unity.</comment>
