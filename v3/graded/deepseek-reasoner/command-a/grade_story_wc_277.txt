<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, compelling higher-stakes choices. Her observant nature drives the investigation, and her final act of recalibration feels earned. However, some interiority slips into diagnostic language ("orbits of regret that had brought her to this moment"), slightly abstracting her emotional state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strong, with clear because/therefore linkages from the journalist's call to the final defiant act. Closure is a decisive change (recalibrating the telescope) with a felt cost of accepting a burdensome truth. The journalist's disappearance remains an unresolved thread, slightly weakening causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vividly rendered and actively constrains choice—the misaligned telescopes directly drive the plot and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early, and escalation is driven by Eleanor's discoveries, narrowing her options to a final defiant act. The cost is legible when she realizes the scheme's human impact. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images (e.g., telescopes pointed earthward, the pen nib's evolution). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about truth and regret. The phrase "orbits of regret" is slightly overused, leaning toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, slightly formal register fitting an heiress. Some sentences are complex, causing minor momentum drag. Dialogue is minimal but functional when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with good rhythmic variation. However, some figurative language feels slightly forced ("orbits of regret," "whispers of the wind"), and a few sentences are overly complex, creating minor scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of an observatory used for surveillance is fresh and well-executed. Tropes are transformed through specific details (e.g., the heirloom pen nib). The synthesis feels organic and inevitable in hindsight, with bold choices that heighten stakes.</comment>
