<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling higher-stakes choices. Her internal conflict is concrete and embodied, particularly in the raw solace she finds in her grueling work. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, though the diagnostic phrase "geography of loss" slightly abstracts her state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as an Earned Stasis with visible cost (the censer's dimming, the relentless migration). The causal lens holds strongly from call to build to beacon. The phone call's origin remains a convenient, unexplained setup, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Mara's POV. The station and censer are well-anchored. However, the environment primarily provides atmosphere rather than actively constraining a key choice or decisively charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, moving from isolation to community builder. The cost of her cyclical task is legible on the page. The arrival of travelers provides a clear, earned consequence of her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept and Mara's actions, resisting moralizing. The final image of the cyclical task offers a resonant, non-literal answer to navigating loss. The phrase "geography of loss" borders on thematic statement but is anchored in the narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and effective, with a distinct perceptual signature. The prose rhythm is controlled, and the voice is consistent. The cryptic dialogue ("Build") is purposeful and advances the plot, though it is minimal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with good rhythm. Minor artifacts include the slightly abstract phrase "geography of loss" and the convenient, unresolved origin of the phone calls, which slightly dull causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of reverse migration, a patchwork navigator, and a mystical artifact feels fresh and organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, creating a singular artistic stance.</comment>
