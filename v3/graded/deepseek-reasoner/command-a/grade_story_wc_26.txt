<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her specific trait as a "dusk noticer," compelling her high-stakes choice to preserve the shadow. Her interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("a surge of luminous regret"). The final choice to metamorphose the shadow is a credible renunciation earned by prior causality, though the diagnostic phrase "luminous regret" slightly dulls the peak beat's embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) landing on the page with felt cost ("a mix of triumph and sorrow"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through a cadence shift from observation to confrontation. The river stone's reweighting at the end charges the final image, and the persistent constraint of forgotten dreams shapes the final tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The "blooming library" and "crystalline vials" are vivid, purposeful details filtered through Elara's professional priorities. The river stone functions as a micro-setting that constrains the final choice, charging the closure image when pressed against the vial. Sensory selection is excellent, narrowing to the vial's "murky" glow and the shadow's "shimmering like smoke" under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens is driven by Elara's agency, moving from observation to active confrontation with the shadow. A single meaningful cadence shift reweights the stake from mystery to preservation, with cost legible in her "heart filled with a mix of triumph and sorrow." The dominant stake of uncovering truth is signaled early and tightens convincingly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the reconciliation of loss and hope, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the sculpture of "light and darkness," reweighting prior material. The shadow's transformation from threat to "testament" embodies the thematic complexity without stating it directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer"). The prose has a controlled, lyrical rhythm that modulates with pressure ("softly deliberate decision"). Purposeful elision (the video footage's mechanics) is taught and paid off by the shadow's physical manifestation, without breaking legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor figurative density in the high-pressure beat ("luminous regret," "shimmering like smoke") creates a slight register drift, though it remains legible. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple layers of story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a fantasy library with shareable dreams and a historical mystery feels fresh and organic. The core concept of a "shadow unbound" as a manifestation of collective regret is a non-obvious, ingenious angle on familiar themes. The specific, grounded choices in character and setting elevate the premise beyond template.</comment>
