<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid ("jealous of past selves"), and the final choice to write is earned by the vision's causality. Embodied emotion is strong, though "jaded wonder" is slightly label-like at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) via the vision and scroll's message, landing with clear cost on the page: "the weight of feral nostalgia lifting." Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll constrains choice and charges the final image, qualifying for the 9-band. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though the cabin's role is more atmospheric than pressuring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency (choosing to drift into the vision) under the accumulative lens, tightening the internal stake. The cost of overcoming envy is legible, though the pressure is more deepening than overtly tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("The story is not in the past or future—it is now") that reweights the thematic question of self-envy without moralizing. Integration is organic and emergent from the vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature. The dialogue with past selves is brief but functional. Minor register consistency in "jaded wonder" prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "jaded wonder" is repeated, creating a slight template cadence that slightly dulls the final image's freshness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lucid dream chronicler grappling with a tangible past through a supernatural scroll feels fresh and organic. The core concept of "feral nostalgia" is transformed through specific, grounded character work.</comment>
