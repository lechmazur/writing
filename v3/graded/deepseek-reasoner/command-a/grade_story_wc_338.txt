<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her to higher-stakes choices. Her methodical curiosity and shielded openness are embodied in her actions, particularly when comparing the videos and excavating. The final choice to excavate is earned, though the interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beat, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage under the inferred Causal lens: her discovery is a direct result of comparing the footage and acting on the discrepancy. Closure is a decisive change (discovering the chapel) with a felt cost of solitude and the weight of bringing others. Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault and ancient henge are not just vivid descriptions; they actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The vault's endurance mirrors Elara's persistence, and the henge is the central object that guides her entire investigation and excavation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (interpreting silence) and escalate through a single, meaningful tightening: the discovery of the misalignment in the video footage. This discovery narrows her options and compels the high-stakes action of excavation. The cost is legible in the profound silence and reverence of the final discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of interpreting silence emerges organically from the particulars of the vault, the henge, and Elara's methods. The final image of the discovered chapel offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The theme is deeply integrated with character and setting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on methodical observation. The prose is controlled and purposeful, though there is a minor register drift in the final paragraph ("guardian of silence") that slightly softens the voice's concrete specificity under peak emotion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong information density. A minor artifact occurs in the climax: the phrase "the air thick with anticipation" is a slight cliché that dulls the immediacy of the excavation beat. Otherwise, the line-level craft is strong and supports the narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The combination of a map framer, a henge, and silent video footage is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels organic. The core concept of a "whispered chapel" is effectively transformed from a rumor into a tangible discovery through specific, grounded choices, though the overall premise is not radically unprecedented.</comment>
