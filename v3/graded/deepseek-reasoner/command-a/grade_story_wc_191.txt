<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is consistent and her "wisely adventurous" trait is demonstrated through her methodical actions. However, her emotional state remains somewhat restrained and diagnostic, lacking the embodied contradiction and irrationality required for the highest band, particularly in the climax where her realization is articulated cleanly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Causal drive lens holds firmly from the ruby flake's guidance to the mural's revelations and the final mechanism. Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing (the throne is for collective wisdom) with a clear on-page cost: the foreclosing of personal power for a deeper understanding, landing effectively in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and immersive, with the orchard and waterfall creating a strong atmosphere. However, while the environment guides Lira, it does not sufficiently constrain her choices to charge the final image, preventing a score in the 9-band. The spatial choreography from murals to waterfall to cavern is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the Causal lens: each discovery directly leads to the next action. The stakes are clear and the cost of her renunciation of personal power is legible on the page. The timeframe is the one weak element, mentioned but not felt as a live pressure altering tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of collective wisdom over individual power emerges organically from Lira's journey and the final reconfiguration of the throne's purpose. It offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The integration is specific and avoids abstraction, though the final realization edges toward tidy articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that supports the mystical tone. The voice remains consistent under pressure. There is a minor register drift in phrases like "wisely adventurous," which feels slightly tell-y, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is generally polished and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "wisely adventurous" is a label that summarizes rather than dramatizes, and there is a slight template cadence in the description of the murals. These do not significantly harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The core concept of an unclaimed throne transformed into a vessel for collective wisdom is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of a familiar quest trope. The combination of elements feels organic. The score is capped as the high-band gate requires Q2 ≥9.0, which it narrowly misses.</comment>
