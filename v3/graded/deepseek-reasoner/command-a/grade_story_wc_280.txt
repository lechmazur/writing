<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, particularly in the tactile exchange of the coin. Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling a high-stakes choice. The synesthesia trait is vivid, though it functions more as rich description than a trait that actively constrains her choices in this scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands with undeniable cost, as Mara's act of hope reconfigures her own purpose while leaving her bound to the garden. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with escalation achieved through increasing sensory and emotional density leading to a decisive cadence shift at dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with purposeful, sensory detail that creates a potent atmosphere. The garden and maze are integral to the tone and concept. However, the environment does not actively pressure or constrain choices; it is a stage, not a crucible, which prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through a meaningful deepening—the shift from summoning to a shared, hopeful connection. The cost is legible in the bittersweet final image of Mara remaining. Agency is demonstrated through Mara's deliberate summoning and persuasive action, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of echoes and possibility, resisting moralizing. The final image of the dawn-washed garden offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of mending broken things through hope and connection, charging prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptually rich texture. The synesthetic descriptions create a strong signature. A minor deduction for occasional ornate phrasing that slightly obscures immediacy in peak beats, but the overall control is exemplary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor overwriting in a few high-pressure beats ("swirling like paint in water") slightly reduces clarity and momentum, preventing a higher score. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a stage ghost, synesthesia, and fractured timelines feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with specificity, avoiding cliché. The risk-taking with a lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coheres.</comment>
