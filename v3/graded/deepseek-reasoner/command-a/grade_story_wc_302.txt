<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer's motivation is clear and intensifies, but her internal conflict is more sequential than simultaneous. Her cautious exuberance is embodied well, and the final choice to become a conduit feels earned, though the mechanism of her selection by the watch is more declared than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure builds through sensory density and pattern repetition. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she accepts her role, with cost felt in the library's acknowledgment and the weight of her task. The watch's function is somewhat vague, a minor causality slip.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful, fully integrated into action and choice. The library's shifting architecture and the watch's syncing hum are not just descriptive; they actively constrain and guide the protagonist's path, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by the library's accumulative pressure and the watch's guidance. The cost of her new role is legible in the library's tremble and the resolved tone of the ending. A single meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the conceit of unspoken words and cyclical time, resisting moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of purpose, reweighting her journey without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture. The voice modulates effectively with the protagonist's emotional state, and the patterned elision (shifting symbols, cyclical reversal) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. No significant loops, scaffold, or artifacts were detected to obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The core premise of a library for unspoken words is fresh and well-executed. The synthesis of time, words, and cyclical patterns feels organic and specific, though the concept of "propagation delays" is slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
