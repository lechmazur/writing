<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent sense of alienation, compelling her higher-stakes choice to encode the ghost. Her micro-choices under pressure, such as placing the bolt plate, reveal a hierarchy of values. However, her internal contradiction—feeling like a ghost herself—is more summarized than dramatized through simultaneous, conflicting impulses in the scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara understands her purpose, with cost legible in the ghost's dissolution and her solitary resolve. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory density and pattern (storm, encoding, graffiti shift) to a cadence shift at the thunderclap. The timeframe acts as a persistent constraint that tightens the action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The courtyard and storm pressure the choice by thinning the veil, and the flower press bolt plate constrains the action as a key tool. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional and poetic perception, such as the "air shimmered with the faint glow of distant lightning."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the accumulating storm and the encoding process, narrowing Elara's options to act within the lightning-thunder window. The cost is felt in the ghost's release and her renewed solitude. Agency is clear in her decisive encoding action, though the pressure is more environmental than interpersonal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of giving voice to the voiceless emerges organically from Elara's actions and the ghost's plight, resisting moralizing. The final image of her composing the next ballad offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights her earlier isolation into purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice that modulates under pressure ("driftingly alert"). Purposeful elision (e.g., the ghost's origin) is taught and paid off. Minor register shift in "tinkersong wonder" feels slightly decorative but does not break coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong sensory propulsion. A minor mixed metaphor ("tinkersong wonder" slightly clashes with the digital/haunting tone) and a template cadence in "Her voice, soft yet haunting..." prevent a higher score, but clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of balladeer and cryptographer, ghost and code, feels fresh and inevitable. The flower press bolt plate as a key is a specific, grounded choice that transforms the trope. Risk-taking in tone and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
