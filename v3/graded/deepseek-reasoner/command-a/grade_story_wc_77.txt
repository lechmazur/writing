<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, moving from curiosity to confrontation. Her final choice to "unbosom" her deepest terror feels earned by the preceding struggle with the cursed clasp and warped reflections. However, a minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label-speak in the climax ("she realized the clasp wasn’t just a curse; it was a tool").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Closure is achieved via a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Clara's understanding of fear reconfigures her reality, with cost felt in the shattering mirrors. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through layered images. A -0.4 deduction for mild lens ambiguity; the advisor's initial causal prompt ("you must trick it") slightly conflicts with the accumulative, internal resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The funhouse setting is indispensable, actively pressuring choices through shifting mirrors and the room of clocks. The "lingering luminance" and "opera cloak clasp" function as micro-settings that constrain and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and deeply integrated with Clara's psychological state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven accumulatively, with density increasing through the cursed object, paradoxical notes, and warping mirrors, forcing Clara's stance crystallization. The dominant stake (conquering internal fear) is tested and the cost is legible in the environment's violent reaction to her unbosoming. One meaningful intensification is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of fear's paradoxical nature is earned through concrete struggle and the final, non-literal image of the fading funhouse. It emerges from the particulars of the clasp's curse and the advisor's riddle-like advice, avoiding moralizing. The final conceptual repricing ("Fear is a paradox...") resonates without being overt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, slightly gothic texture that suits the setting. The advisor's dialogue carries a repulsive allure distinct from Clara's internal voice. A minor deduction for a rare register drift ("repulsive allure" feels slightly tell-y for peak interiority).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A -0.6 deduction for minor artifacts: some synonymous phrasing ("whispered secrets"/"voice slithered") and a template cadence in the description of the clasp's flickering image. These do not obscure closure but slightly dull the line-level precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The combination of a psychologically cursed object and a surreal funhouse setting feels fresh and organic. The core concept is executed with commitment, transforming familiar tropes of haunted places and facing fears through specific, grounded details like the photographically cursed clasp. The resolution feels earned and inevitable.</comment>
