<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, compelling her higher-stakes choice with the stone. Her internal conflict is embodied and concrete, avoiding diagnostic speech. The final renunciation of home as a physical place is earned by the prior causality of her struggle, with a visible cost of confronting buried pain. A slight over-reliance on abstract language in the climax ("harmony of her fragmented self") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where her understanding of home is reconfigured, foreclosing her search with a felt cost. Orientation is immediate and the stone's discovery provides a clear inciting incident. The final cost is legible in the "quiet strength" she carries, though the linkage from the feather texture to the breakthrough could be more causally tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore is a masterful micro-setting that actively pressures Elara's choices and supplies the key object. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through her POV. The environment evolves causally with her actions, the shelves rearranging in response. The stone itself functions as a key object that constrains her choice and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift—the stone's discovery and subsequent activation—that deepens and reweights the dominant stake of understanding home. The cost is legible in the "storm within her" breaking. Agency is clear as her choice to "seed" her thoughts into the stone directly drives the escalation and closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of home as an internal state emerges organically from the particulars of the stone, the bookstore, and Elara's struggle, resisting a tidy moral. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. A minor thematic echo in the final paragraph ("a harmony of her past and present") slightly diminishes the effect by stating what the image had already shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled syntax and rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The perceptual signature is strong and selective. Purposeful elision (the mechanics of "substituting reality") is taught and paid off by its absence heightening the focus on the present moment. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and propulsive with high information density. However, minor overwriting occurs in peak beats with stacked modifiers and abstract nouns ("harmony of her fragmented self"), slightly blurring sense and momentum. A template cadence emerges in consecutive sentences starting with "The" in the climax. No loops or scaffolding issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The core premise synthesizes familiar concepts (magical bookstore, seer, lost language) into a fresh, specific, and emotionally grounded whole. The execution feels singular and authentic, not derivative. The choice to make home a state of being is a non-obvious and transformative inflection that feels inevitable in hindsight. The conceptual integrity is high.</comment>
