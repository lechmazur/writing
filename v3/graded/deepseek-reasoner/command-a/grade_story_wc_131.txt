<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dweller's motivation is clear and consistently drives their methodical actions. Embodied emotion is strong, particularly in the handling of the tape reel and the flicker of sense memory. The final choice to share the story feels earned, though the internal contradiction between safety and visibility could be more sharply dramatized under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens fits best, with pressure building through sensory and symbolic density. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) as the dweller's realization reconfigures their purpose. The cost is legible in the final paragraph's "weight of their own cached memories begin to lift," though the linkage from fragment to closure could be slightly tighter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The library is a vital, pressure-exerting environment, not a backdrop. The "sapphire hush" and "pipe chases" are recurring elements that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and deeply filtered through the dweller's POV, creating a coherent and immersive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (to become visible) and escalate through the accumulative discovery of fragments. The dweller's agency is demonstrated through their methodical search. A single meaningful deepening occurs as the fragments prompt introspection, reweighting the personal stake with cost, though the external pressure from the outage is underutilized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of cached memories and the found tape, exploring preservation and connection. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. A slight deduction for the phrase "to matter," which edges toward thematic statement in the final beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythm. The perceptual signature is strong and consistent. A minor register drift occurs in the climax with "to matter," but it is brief and does not significantly disrupt the established voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high. A minor artifact is the slightly jargony feel of "sense memory" in an otherwise embodied narrative, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The concept of a hidden dweller preserving stories is fresh and executed with specificity. The synthesis of character, setting, and object (tape reels) feels organic and inevitable. The quiet, introspective risk pays off, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
