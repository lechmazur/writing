<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in expertise, with micro-choices under pressure revealing grit. Her internal state is concrete, though "cautiously hopeful" trends slightly toward label-speak. The final endurance is earned, with visible cost in the community's division.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Elara's decoding leads directly to her countermeasure. Closure is Earned Stasis (vigilance) with cost felt in the protests. The community's off-page reaction is summarized, slightly weakening the on-page cost proof at the very end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The radio station is a rich, pressure-filled environment that constrains choice (e.g., using old equipment). Astronomical charts are a tactile, recurring object that charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (losing sponsors, community chaos) are signaled early. Escalation is driven by Elara's agency: her decision to emit a counter-frequency is a meaningful tightening. The cost is legible in the protests, though its presentation is slightly summarized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of human ingenuity vs. cosmic deception emerges through action, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the image of a "bastion." Avoids moralizing, though the cosmic tricksters concept leans slightly toward thematic declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by expertise ("celestial patterns," "subsonic frequencies"). The single line of dialogue from Hank is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with high information density. Figurative language ("constellations that seemed to whisper secrets") is purposeful and taught. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies effectively with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cosmic signal threat with a university radio setting feels fresh and specific. The concept of "cosmic tricksters" is a non-obvious angle on first contact tropes. The ending commits fully to its premise without retreat.</comment>
