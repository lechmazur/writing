<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to defeat emotional numbness is clear and embodied through the duel. Contradictory impulses of fear and liberation act simultaneously in the climax, and the final integration is earned by prior causality. A minor deduction for "ego death" and "emotional numbness" leaning slightly into diagnostic label-speak, though they are quickly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A strong Causal drive lens holds: the brain's presence forces the confrontation, leading to the decisive change of integration. Closure lands on the page with the shattering jar and merging essence, a clear DC with the felt cost of shattered glass and liberated emotion. The final image reconfigures Kael's identity with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo and the brain jar are vivid and purposeful. The jar constrains choice as the central object of the conflict and charges the final image when shattered. A minor deduction as the dojo's "floating" nature is more atmospheric than a constraint that actively pressures tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: Kael's decision to duel and final strike directly narrow options and force the integration. The cost is legible in the tremble of their hands and the shattering glass. The dominant stake (emotional vivification) is tested and paid for on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of integrating fractured selfhood emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the duel and the jar. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of merging essences, reweighting the clone from a custody battle to a part of the self. Avoids moralizing; the insight is earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filters perception through Kael's emotional state. The prose has a distinct, controlled rhythm, though a minor deduction for a cluster of filter verbs in high-pressure beats ("Kael felt something stir," "Kael understood") which slightly dull immediacy. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong information density. A minor deduction for the filter-verb cluster noted in Q6 and a slight template cadence in "Fear, anger, sadness, joy—they came in waves." These are minor artifacts that do not significantly obscure closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The core premise synthesizes a surreal setting (floating dojo) with a deeply personal, psychological conflict (clone custody as internal struggle) in a fresh, non-obvious way. The combination feels organic and inevitable in hindsight, committed fully to its implications without retreat. The brain jar is a uniquely irreplaceable element.</comment>
