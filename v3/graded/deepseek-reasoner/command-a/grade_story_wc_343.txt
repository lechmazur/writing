<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's "diligently curious" nature is embodied through concrete actions like tracing the phrasebook's dog-ear and noting patterns, compelling higher-stakes choices as the glow intensifies. Her sociable isolation and motivation to chart discoveries feel rooted in consistent traits, with micro-choices under pressure revealing values. The final renunciation of isolation is earned by prior causality, though a slight diagnostic label ("sociable isolation") appears briefly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly: the hopscotch board's glow (because of her noting) leads directly to the hatch discovery (therefore new options). Closure is a decisive change with cost—foreclosing isolation by embracing Thorne's legacy—legible in the final image of the compass rose. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is deeply integrated: the airship's brass hull and navigation chamber constrain choices (e.g., hatch discovery at stern), while starling murmurations mirror hopscotch patterns to charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "amber twilight," "crystalline orbs"). The hopscotch board functions as a micro-setting that directly shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes (charting discovery) tighten meaningfully through protagonist agency: Elara's decision to follow the light beam forecloses her isolation and enables the map's discovery. Cost is legible in her "trembling hands" and the foreclosed path of solitude. Coherent causal escalation under lens; no coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (perseverance leading to discovery) emerges through particulars like the dog-ear marked "Persevera" and the final map, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the compass rose image. Minor echo in Thorne's quoted line feels slightly prompt-like but is anchored in character.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with perceptual signature ("amber twilight," "pulse with a life of their own"). Internal texture remains consistent under pressure. Slight register elevation in phrases like "sociable isolation" and Thorne's dialogue, but not disruptive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density (e.g., "brass hull gleaming faintly against swirling murmurations"). Minor figurative density in peak beats ("pulse with a life of their own") slightly softens clarity but doesn't obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of airship exploration, hopscotch board mechanics, and stranded luminance concept feels fresh. Tropes transformed through specific details (polyglot phrasebook, starling mirroring). The hybrid causal-accumulative structure supports inevitability, though luminance's rules are lightly sketched.</comment>
