<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her search. Her curiosity is embodied and character-specific, driving micro-choices like pressing the hearing aid to her ear. The final choice to protect the story is a credible endurance, though the "incidental heroism" label feels slightly told rather than fully dramatized in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory density and pattern breaks. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the photograph's warmth and the fading pulses create a before/after shift with a felt cost of responsibility. The orientation is immediate, and the final image reconfigures the mission's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices, constraining visibility and shaping the search. The hearing aid and photograph function as objects-as-setting, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, fully integrated into the POV's perception and goal-directed action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a single, decisive intensification through sensory density and the urgency of the whispers. The dominant stake (protecting a voice) is signaled early and tightens with the discovery of the photograph, forcing a stance crystallization. The cost of this responsibility is legible on the page in the final beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme of listening to the forgotten emerges organically from the central action and the final, resonant image. It resists a tidy moral, embracing the complexity of enduring responsibility. A minor deduction for the slightly explicit phrase "incidental heroism" in the final paragraph, which edges toward thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The perceptual signature is strong, filtering the world through Elara's professional and empathetic lens. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon, and the elision of other characters is purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. Minor artifacts include a slight paraphrase loop ("faint pulses" / "faint, rhythmic beeps") and the phrase "incidental heroism" which registers a minor label-speak deduction. However, these do not significantly obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core premise of a "contact tracer for hearts" offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of the supernatural and the empathetic. The specific, grounded choices in the misty setting and the hearing aid object create a memorable and authentic vision. The concept is fully committed to and follows its implications without retreat.</comment>
