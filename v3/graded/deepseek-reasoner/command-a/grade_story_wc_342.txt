<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara's face-blindness and fractally precise perception are specific, embodied traits that actively shape her goal and tactics. Her motivation to "mirror the sky inside walls" is a compelling, character-particular obsession. The final endurance under the collapsing building shows a credible, earned stance. A slight deduction for the trait being more observational than decision-forcing in the middle beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage from setup (coin, goal) to climax (deciphering, building collapse). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she achieves her goal amidst destruction, with clear cost ("the building shuddered violently"). The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through sensory density and the imminent demolition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is a brilliant, specific setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Elara's unique perception. The decaying building and the living tree create a potent atmospheric tension that mirrors the internal stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (the challenge of capturing the infinite) and escalate meaningfully through the discovery process and the building's impending collapse. The cost is legible in the final shudder. Agency is demonstrated through her focused crafting, though the external pressure of demolition is more situational than directly caused by her actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of finding infinity within limits emerges organically from the core concept and action. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the initial stillness from oppressive to beautiful. Avoids moralizing, achieving complexity through the specific synthesis of art, decay, and discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's distinctive perceptual signature. Prose rhythm is controlled and purposeful, though a few phrases verge on slightly elevated diction ("fractally precise detail"). The voice consistently reflects her artist's mindset and unique way of seeing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong information density. Minor deduction for a slight tendency toward ornate description in a few spots (e.g., "fractally precise movements") which creates a subtle rhythmic echo, slightly detracting from peak momentum during the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a face-blind portrait artist and a tree trunk library is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is specific and fully committed to, transforming familiar tropes of artistic pursuit and hidden knowledge into a fresh, coherent, and memorable whole.</comment>
