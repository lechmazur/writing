<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The traveler’s motivation is clear and specific, and her micro-choice to write an obituary for the waiting woman is a credible, high-agency act. However, the final choice to accept the thread feels more like a received gift than a difficult, cost-bearing decision, slightly softening the closure's earned quality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the traveler’s understanding of connection is reweighted by the gift of the thread. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through descriptive density and a cadence shift into the final, cost-bearing image of the stars as "tiny obituaries."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The shadowed garden is a masterclass in micro-setting, actively constraining the encounter and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and deeply filtered through the traveler's POV, with the autumn atmosphere functioning as a crucible for the thematic action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a single, decisive intensification: the traveler’s act of writing the obituary reweights the dominant stake of "explained absences" with clear, felt cost witnessed in the woman's tears. The price is legible on the page, though the protagonist's agency in the final beat is slightly passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of absences and connection emerges organically from the concrete action of writing obituaries and is crystallized in the potent final image of the tapestry. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing, achieving significant depth for the word count.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose exhibits a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure. The single line of dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and the controlled use of free indirect style deepens the POV without any head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The prose is concise and propulsive, with every sentence advancing character, atmosphere, or story, particularly in the potent closure sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The core premise of writing obituaries for the living is a fresh, non-obvious angle on themes of loss and memory, executed with high conceptual integrity. It loses a fraction of a point for a faint familiarity in the "lonely observer" archetype, but the specific synthesis of elements feels organic and inevitable.</comment>
