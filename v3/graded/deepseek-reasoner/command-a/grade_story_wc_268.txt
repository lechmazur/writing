<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to escalate her messages. Her resolve is embodied, but her internal contradiction under stress is summarized rather than dramatized in scene. The final choice to press the ink pellet is a strong micro-choice revealing her values, though her emotional progression feels slightly tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly; the pretender's annotated response is a key turn that escalates the conflict logically. Closure is a decisive change (facade cracking) with a visible cost (the pellet clattering). The orientation is clear within the first 120 words, though the final confrontation's spatial choreography is slightly vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The library is a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables Elara's method, pressuring her choices. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV. The recurring object (ink pellet) charges the final image. Spatial coherence is generally maintained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens, with each message and response tightening the pressure. The cost is legible in the pretender's shifting tone and the final dropped pellet. However, the climax's physical staging lacks the same concrete causal pressure as the message exchanges.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. deception) emerges organically from the rune, the messages, and the final confrontation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the rune's meaning reconfigured. Avoids moralizing, though the final line ("promise of a brighter future") leans slightly tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, archaic-tinged narrative texture. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven and carries subtext in the final confrontation. The prose rhythm is controlled, though a few phrases ("regally unpretentious titan") feel slightly repetitious.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but minor artifacts exist. The phrase "regally unpretentious" is used repeatedly, creating a slight template cadence. A synonym loop occurs with "false light" and "shadow." These do not obscure closure but dull the peak beat's immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The core concept (rune of drift) is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the conflict. The combination of a library setting and cryptographic messaging feels fresh. However, the "diminutive titan" descriptor leans slightly archetypal without fully personalizing the character's physicality in choices.</comment>
