<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her trait, compelling her to lie and take action. However, interiority lacks deep contradiction under pressure; her emotional state is more summarized than embodied in the final, high-stakes decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly with clear because/therefore linkages from discovery to decision. Closure is a decisive change (exposing the truth) with felt cost implied by stepping into the unknown. The final transmission provides a tight, earned reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The social network archive functions effectively as a micro-setting that pressures choices and supplies key clues. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, though the body-as-setting under stress is not fully leveraged in the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate coherently under the causal lens, from curiosity to a high-stakes cover-up. Elara's agency drives the escalation, notably through her lie and bypassing security, narrowing her options and raising the personal cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of buried truth and corporate silence emerges organically from the investigation and the final revelation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the coordinates and Elara's resolve, reweighting the archive's purpose without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, analytical texture suited to the character. The prose maintains rhythmic control and clarity under pressure, with elision (e.g., security bypass) taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence structures. No significant loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Minor register drift in phrases like "sensed absence" is voice-motivated and does not harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of corporate archivist and cosmic mystery feels fresh and organic. The core concept is executed with specificity, though the "taken not crashed" trope is familiar; it is elevated by the pattern-based investigation and the final, charged image.</comment>
