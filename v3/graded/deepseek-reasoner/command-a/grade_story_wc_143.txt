<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's "purposefully curious" nature is shown through her meticulous documentation and her choice to defy mission control, a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values. The mentor's backstory is economically woven in via the sand grain and the message, anchoring her present stance and motivating her final, costly act of endurance. A minor deduction for the mentor's message feeling slightly convenient as a plot device, though its personal connection to Elara mitigates this.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through the weight of history and the impending dawn. Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis; her renunciation (leaving the site to be altered) forecloses a path with a visible, melancholic cost felt in the final image. The chemical message is a perfectly timed inciting incident that reconfigures her mission from documentation to preservation, and the cost is legible in the "heavy heart" and the fading summit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The "moonlit summit" is a character in itself, its "dawning hush" and "dawnlit melancholy" applying immense temporal pressure that directly constrains Elara's choice to outlast the night. The lunar regolith, module, and headlamp light are tactile, purpose-driven details filtered through her professional POV. The environment subtly mirrors her internal state of solemn reverence and loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving history) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by the Accumulative lens: the discovery of the timed message deepens her knowledge and radically raises the personal cost of her task, narrowing her options to a single, defiant act of endurance. The cost is unmistakable in her heavy-hearted departure and the loss of the site.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (impermanence vs. preservation) emerges organically from the conflict between progress and history, crystallized in the final, resonant image of the site "bathed in the golden light of a new day." The sand grain and the message are potent, non-literal motifs that charge the ending without moralizing. The ending offers a complex, bittersweet answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersed in Elara's perceptual signature—professional, curious, melancholic. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture ("dawning hush," "dawnlit melancholy") that modulates effectively with the emotional pressure. A single minor instance of slightly precious phrasing ("dawning hush") prevents a higher score, but the voice is otherwise coherent and compelling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and evocative with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, a minor scaffold artifact exists in the phrase "the dawning hush would remain," which feels slightly repetitive of earlier descriptions and less sharp than the surrounding language. This small flaw prevents a higher score but does not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise of a lunar preservationist documenting a site for its own destruction is a fresh, poignant synthesis of familiar sci-fi concepts. The specific lived detail—the chemical message, the sand grain—transforms the template into a singular story about legacy and loss. The choice to end on Earned Stasis is a bold, specific risk that heightens the stakes and coherence.</comment>
