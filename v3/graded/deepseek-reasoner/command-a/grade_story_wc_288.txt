<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her choices under pressure. However, interiority relies on summary ("brittle determination") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to coexist is earned, but the internal cost of this transformation is more conceptual than viscerally embodied on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is clearly taught and held, with pressure escalating through density of detail and resonant imagery. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights prior material, with the cost of her transformed existence legible in the final image of her as the "embodiment" of knowledge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tidal library is a masterful, active setting that profoundly constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's perception and action, creating a palpable atmosphere that is essential to the narrative's logic and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates effectively through the library's reactive mechanisms and the intensifying hum, culminating in a decisive choice at the orb. The cost of her new, transformed state is conceptually clear, though its visceral weight is slightly attenuated by the prose's elevated register at the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of translating isolation into independence emerges organically from the library's nature and Elena's arc. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of coexistence. A minor deduction for the phrase "brittle awakenings," which edges toward thematic echo rather than fully earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, consistent texture and rhythmic control. The voice is slightly elevated but remains apt for the character and setting. Some minor filter verbs ("she felt") and a tendency toward summary in peak emotional beats prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in the opening ("Elena stood... Her boots sinking...") and some synonym churn ("brittle" used three times). These do not obscure closure but slightly dull the line-level precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core premise of the tidal library is strikingly original and executed with conceptual integrity. The combination of elements—extinct species, reincarnation memory, celestial mechanics—feels fresh and organic, synthesized into a singular, memorable vision that is indispensable to the story.</comment>
