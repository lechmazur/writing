<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied emotion, with micro-choices under pressure (trembling hands, focused alignment). However, the final paragraph's declarative wisdom ("We are all broken...") edges into diagnostic label-speak, slightly unearned in the moment and reducing the score from a higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost (workshop's instability, reclaimed peace). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory and pattern density. A minor deduction for the slightly convenient calming of the acid sea immediately following her declaration, which softens the cost's persistence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The workshop and acid sea are masterfully integrated, applying constant pressure that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's urgency and expertise (scent of oil and rust, hissing sea). The statue and charm function as micro-settings that actively shape the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (memory/conjuring meaning) are clear and escalate coherently under the accumulative lens through increasing pattern density and environmental pressure. Protagonist agency drives the key turn (aligning the charm). Cost is legible in the workshop's violent reaction, though its immediate calming after her speech slightly reduces the price's lasting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The kintsugi concept is deeply integrated, emerging from concrete action rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the illuminated statue and found peace. A minor deduction for the final line's slightly explicit thematic summation ("conjured hope"), which leans toward declaration but is anchored by the preceding image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptive signature (noticing through an alchemist's lens). The prose is generally controlled, but occasional register drift into elevated diction ("conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion") slightly clashes with the POV's embodied stress in peak moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("quilts memories together" used twice) and slight synonym churn ("frayed beyond repair" / "dissolved entirely"). These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gears-and-cogs workshop on an acid sea is a fresh, specific synthesis. The application of kintsugi to memory recovery feels organic and inevitable. The lyric risk-taking with compressed time ("between breaths held underwater") heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
