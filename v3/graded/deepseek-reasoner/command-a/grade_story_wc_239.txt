<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The witness's motivation is clear and their "wanderingly exact" nature is a compelling paradox. However, interiority remains abstract ("felt the weight of their task"); emotions are labeled rather than embodied in concrete, contradictory impulses under pressure, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing, reweighting the witness's purpose. The Accumulative lens holds, building through layered images. Causality is weak at the climax; the dictionary's merger with the mural feels more symbolic than causally earned, lacking a clear "because/therefore" linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and functions as a living, pressure-exerting entity. The temple library and the dictionary itself are specific, purposeful details that charge the final image. It narrowly misses the 9-band as the environment, while reactive, doesn't decisively constrain a key choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (unifying existence) is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is present as density and pattern intensity increase. However, the pressure feels declarative; the cost of the final unification remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt or concretely paid on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of spiral arbitration and the witness's journey. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the quest for unity. It avoids moralizing, though the abstract nature of the concepts ("cosmic illusions") prevents the deepest emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and effectively filtered through the witness's perceptual signature. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythm. There is no head-hopping, and the voice remains consistent and apt for the story's mystical aims.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a tendency toward abstract language ("fractured essence of existence") and a slight over-reliance on figurative description in high-pressure beats, which slightly mutes the clarity of the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cosmic witness, a sentient library, and a conceptual conflict feels fresh and specific. The core concept of "spiral arbitration" is an original, non-obvious angle on resolving conflict. The story commits fully to its high-concept premise without retreating into safety.</comment>
