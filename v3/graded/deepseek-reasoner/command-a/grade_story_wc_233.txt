<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The queen's motivation is clear and intensifies credibly, with embodied emotion ("tremor in her chest") and a micro-choice to press on. Her final renunciation is earned by the scene's causality, though her internal contradiction could be more dramatized in the moment of choice rather than summarized in the resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A strong causal drive lens holds throughout. Closure is a decisive change (vow to restore balance) with a clear on-page cost (the weight of her people's deeds). Orientation is immediate, and the final image of the grotto sighing in relief charges the closure effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the queen's perception. The grotto pressures her choice and charges the final image. However, it primarily functions as atmosphere; its physical properties don't actively constrain her tactics during the climb, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the queen's agency under the causal lens, narrowing her options to a single vow. The dominant stake (truth/responsibility) is clear, and the cost is legible. The pressure could feel more immediate and physically threatening in the middle beats to heighten tension further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the bleeding starlight imagery and the queen's realization, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about responsibility. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, though the thematic concept of balance is slightly more stated than fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with a perceptually signature ("lacy menace," "cobalt grotto"). The elision of the climb is purposeful and paid off at closure. Diction and rhythm remain controlled under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concise imagery. Information density is high, and sentences advance multiple elements. A minor instance of paraphrasing ("disenchanted queen was no longer disenchanted") slightly dulls the final line, but no major artifacts harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a queen's personal journey with cosmic ecological stakes feels fresh and organic. The core concept of bleeding starlight is transformed through specific, grounded choices. The execution is bold and coherent, though the archetype of the seeking monarch is familiar.</comment>
