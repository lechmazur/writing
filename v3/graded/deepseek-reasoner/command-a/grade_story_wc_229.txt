<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong embodied emotion ("screaming tenderness that made his chest ache"). The final renunciation of doubt is earned by the scene's causality, though a minor slip occurs when the woman articulates the thematic thesis, slightly diminishing the character's earned realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, landing with visible cost on the page ("his doubts"). The linkage from the cork's hum to the final understanding is coherent and taught, though the woman's direct statement of the theme slightly softens the conceptual payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, masterfully filtered through the POV. The lighthouse and garden scent charge the atmosphere, though the setting functions more as a evocative backdrop than a constraint that actively narrows the protagonist's choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, with a clear tightening from curiosity to understanding. The cost of his former doubt is legible, though the pressure remains internal and the external figure's arrival feels slightly coincidental, complicating but not fully resolving the stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The final image of the lighthouse as a beacon of "quiet strength" reweights prior material without moralizing, though the woman's line comes perilously close to explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose's texture is consistent and voice-motivated, effectively modulating with emotional intensity. The elision of the woman's specifics is taught and pays off at closure, maintaining mystery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concisely evocative with high information density and excellent rhythm. A minor template cadence appears ("His task... but his mind"; "He reached... Closing his eyes") and a single filter verb ("he felt") in a peak beat, but these do not measurably obscure closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mundane object (vial cork) with a metaphysical concept (vibrations of intent) feels fresh and organic. The emotional specificity avoids generic templates, though the core concept shares a well-trodden literary space of magical realism, limiting sheer ingenuity.</comment>
