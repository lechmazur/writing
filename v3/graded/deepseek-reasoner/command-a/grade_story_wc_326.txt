<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through micro-choices under pressure, particularly her tactile interaction with the porcelain shard and determined work at the console. The final endurance is earned, though the ghost's voice resolving the mystery feels slightly external, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds with strong because/therefore linkages from investigation to revelation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final realization. The ghost's expositional dialogue slightly softens the earned quality of the epiphany.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The opal observatory and porcelain shard are not merely descriptive; they actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's urgency, with the cold and silence pressuring her isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in defragmenting the data, narrowing her options to a single path of understanding. The cost is the emotional weight of confronting a lost self, though the stakes could feel more visceral and immediate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of fetching wisdom from failure emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the data defragmentation and the ghost's message. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the premise of her existence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, analytical texture that modulates under pressure. The ghost's dialogue carries a distinct, ethereal quality separate from Elara's internal voice. Minor rhythmic repetition in sentence openings prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A slight over-reliance on simile ("like a forgotten relic," "like galaxies") creates minor figurative clutter in early paragraphs, though it does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a digital ghost, a death certificate error, and a porcelain shard feels fresh and organic. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on identity and memory, committed to its implications without retreat into cliché.</comment>
