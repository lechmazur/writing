<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear and rooted in her established traits ("drawn to in between spaces"), with embodied emotion ("fingers brushing," "breath caught"). Her final choice to become a conduit feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost (the dissolved program, a path foreclosed).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through pattern and cadence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final image of the dissolved program and lingering resonance. A slight causality hiccup exists when the ghost appears, momentarily tipping toward a Causal event, but the textural payoff recenters the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices (navigating water, limited light) and decisively charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Clara's professional POV ("unstruck chords," "waterlogged floor").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift driven by Clara's agency (humming the melody), which reweights the dominant stake (silence vs. music) with a clear, felt cost—the dissolution of the program and the ghost's departure. Pressure coheres and deepens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (memory, art, liminality) emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of intertwined music and memory. Subtext operates powerfully in the "wordless conversation" and the water-damaged code.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature ("the hush of unstruck chords"). The prose's lyrical, rhythmic control is consistent and heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. Purposeful elision (the ghost's exact nature) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, serving the accumulative design. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, specific synthesis of ghost story and artistic inspiration. The flooded opera house and water-damaged score are highly original and irreplaceable elements. The execution commits fully to its lyrical, textural concept without gimmickry.</comment>
