<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's reticent, observant nature is consistently embodied and drives micro-choices, culminating in a credible Earned Stasis where his resolve solidifies. The final choice to "protect the light" is motivated by the on-page causality of discovered messages and the reconfiguration of his purpose. A slight deduction for a minor tell ("it was something else, something he’d been chasing") that abstracts a peak emotional beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A strong Causal drive lens holds: the lamp flicker (inciting incident) triggers discovery of sea glass, which leads to stone decoding, compartment opening, and closure. The final Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) lands with clear cost—Elias forecloses his passive life for an active guardian role. The persistent constraint of isolation and mystery shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lantern room functions as a micro-setting that actively pressures choices (darkness enabling discovery, compartment revealing letters). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's professional expertise. The sea glass and stones are recurring objects that constrain choice and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: Elias's investigation of the flicker, retrieval of glass, and rearrangement of stones each tighten options and raise stakes. The cost is legible in his transformed resolve, though the price of his new duty is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the sea glass, stones, and letters, culminating in the non-literal, resonant idea of "bottling safety" through guardianship. The final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. A minor deduction for the slightly overt phrasing of the core concept ("bottle the feeling of safety") in the letter, though it is integrated into the action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filtered through Elias's perceptive, quiet nature. The prose has a distinct, rhythmic texture suited to the setting and character. A minor register drift occurs in the phrase "luminescent ache," which feels slightly more poetic than the narrator's established voice, though it is thematically motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong information density. A minor scaffold phrase ("it was something else, something he’d been chasing") creates a slight abstraction in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, sentences advance story and character efficiently, with varied rhythm and purposeful detail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lonely lighthouse keeper, mysterious messages, and nautical communication methods feels fresh and organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details and a quiet, emotional resolution. While not radically innovative, the execution is highly authentic and coherent.</comment>
