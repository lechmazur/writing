<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her archival purpose. Her embodied emotion is strong ("locket felt warm in her hands"), though her internal conflict is more implied than dramatized by contradictory impulses. The final choice to document is earned, but the emotional range is somewhat narrow, lacking the irrational hypocrisy of a deep flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara’s role is repriced to active participant in the covenant, with cost felt in her "heart swelling with a sense of purpose." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory and thematic density. The investigatory turn to Mara is a lightly handled but logical proximate cause.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The jetty is indispensable, constraining choice by being the site of discovery and the object of the covenant. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("scent of blooming jasmine, mingling with the salty tang"). The locket functions as a micro-setting, charging the final image and shaping Elara's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to a participatory role in a generational covenant, a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible in Elara’s altered purpose. However, the pressure is more thematic than actively coercive, relying on discovery rather than a forced trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of preservation, regeneration, and the weight of small moments. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The covenant’s adaptive nature embraces complexity, though it leans slightly toward thematic statement in Mara’s explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture. The perceptual signature is strong ("whispers of the past"). The single line of dialogue from Mara is natural and goal-driven, though its brevity limits full voice distinction. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence structures. Information density is high, with lines serving multiple functions. A minor paraphrase loop exists ("preservation" and "regeneration" in close succession), but it does not obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of archivist, covenant, and jetty feels fresh and organic. The concept is transformed through specific, grounded detail rather than remaining a template. The emotional truth of connecting to the past is particular and avoids generic templates, though the core premise is not radically unconventional.</comment>
