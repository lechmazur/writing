<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira's reflective nature is well-established and consistent, though her agency is largely observational rather than decisional. Her internal state is rendered through specific, embodied perception ("her eyes tracing the thin filaments of sunrise"). The final realization feels earned by the ritual's causality, though the choice itself is a passive acceptance rather than an active, costly decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held throughout, with closure achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing). The cost is legible in the final image of the stone as a "talisman," a forfeiture of the moment to carry its meaning forward. The pattern of observation intensifies to a moment of reweighting, fulfilling the lens requirements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is not merely decorative; it actively constrains and enables Mira's ritual. The prism atrium and the pond are essential tools that charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply filtered through the POV's professional and reflective lens ("noctilucent veil," "quiet galaxy"). The environment is the primary engine of the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a cadence shift and density increase in the observation of the ripples and light, which reweights the dominant stake of finding value. The cost is the quiet acknowledgment of the stone's journey to her pocket, a minor but felt forfeiture. Agency is in her attentive endurance, which narrows her focus and deepens the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of finding value in the mundane emerges organically from the specific, concretely rendered action of throwing the stone. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The concept is fully integrated into the events and images, particularly the reprise of the "noctilucent" quality from the mist to the boats' glow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical voice consistent under pressure. The prose has a distinct texture and rhythmic control, though it occasionally flirts with density that slightly obscures immediacy (e.g., "noctilucent reckonings"). There is no head-hopping, and the elision of other characters is purposeful and effective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, minor artifacts appear, such as the slightly over-stacked modifier "noctilucent reckonings" and a tendency toward complex syntax that, while beautiful, can momentarily stall momentum. The closure image remains clear and potent despite this minor density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a glazier, light refraction, and a meditative ritual feels fresh and organic. The perspective is memorable and specific, avoiding cliché. The core concept is executed with commitment and conceptual integrity, transforming a simple act into a meaningful exploration of value. The risk of a passive, observational protagonist is mitigated by the strength of the voice and imagery.</comment>
