<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The guardian's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with the setting, transforming from feral waiting to active curation. The final choice to wear the pendant is a credible endurance, earned by prior yearning. However, the phrase "interiorizing exteriors" borders on diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat, slightly abstracting an otherwise embodied process.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the garden's new wing and the guardian's changed role landing with palpable cost. The lens holds from the opening atmospheric accumulation through the final image. A minor orientation delay exists as the "who" (a beast that is also a librarian) is somewhat ambiguous in the first 120 words, but this serves the mystical tone and is later clarified.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frozen garden is indispensable, functioning as a character that pressures choice and charges the final image. It constrains the guardian's existence and supplies the very stories it guards. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and wholly integrated with action, from "frost‑bitten volumes" to "mist‑woven verses." The setting's evolution from archive to open library is the story's decisive change.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the guardian's agency under the Accumulative lens: discovering the pendant and choosing to wear it. This single meaningful deepening reweights the dominant stake of waiting versus action, foreclosing the path of pure stasis. The cost is felt in the binding of its "feral heart to a purpose beyond mere guardianship," a tangible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of embracing uncertainty emerges organically from the guardian's specific yearning and the pendant's "pact of uncertainty." The final image of the new library wing is a resonant, non-literal answer to this central question, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The integration is masterful, avoiding abstraction for concrete, earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is exceptionally distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by the library's arcane nature ("sang in rusted syllables"). The prose's lyrical, accumulative rhythm is controlled and purpose-driven, teaching its pattern early. There is no head-hopping, and all elision serves the closure effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with excellent rhythmic control. However, a minor artifact appears in the peak beat: the phrase "interiorizing exteriors" is a near-abstract nominalization that slightly disrupts the otherwise embodied texture. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure but prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a feral guardian, a living library, and dimensional homesickness is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coheres perfectly with the closure.</comment>
