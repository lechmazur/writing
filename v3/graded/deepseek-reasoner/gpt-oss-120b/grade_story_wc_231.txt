<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marlowe's eccentricity and motivation are vividly embodied, particularly in his method of reading the tide's gaps. His final choice to place the flower as a beacon is a credible renunciation earned by prior causality. A minor deduction for a slight lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, with pressure building through pattern recognition in the tide and flower. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise), landing with undeniable cost as Marlowe's isolation is reconfigured into purpose. The final image of the light tracing the gaps is the exact point of cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The opal dock and lighthouse tower are not just vivid but function as the crucible for the central choice, constraining Marlowe's investigation. The setting's sensory details (bruised lavender sea, salt spray) are filtered through his specific, professional POV and are integral to the plot's mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marlowe's agency in observing and interpreting the tidal patterns, a meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. The stake (decoding the message) is clear and tightens as he discerns the pattern, with the cost of his transformed loneliness felt on the page. A minor deduction as the pressure, while coherent, is more contemplative than actively pressing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (isolation, memory, witness) emerges organically from the confluence of the flower, the journal, and Marlowe's method. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the lighthouse beam, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The integration is exceptional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that reflects Marlowe's perceptive and melancholic nature. The voice modulates effectively under pressure, and the patterned elision (e.g., the stranger's identity) is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. A minor deduction for a potential instance of overwriting or figurative density in the phrase "a canvas upon which the stranger had painted a fleeting hope," which slightly risks abstraction in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lighthouse keeper decoding memories via tidal patterns is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is executed with specificity and commitment, avoiding cliché. The risk-taking with the accumulative structure heightens the stakes and meaning.</comment>
