<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The peacekeeper's calmly intuitive nature is embodied and drives micro-choices, particularly the decision to use the mirrors. Her motivation to "map empathy onto action" is dramatized through her focus on the reflections of others' suffering, compelling her higher-stakes choice to reconstitute the sphere. However, the final insight ("true power lay not in the stone but in the willingness to listen") edges into diagnostic self-awareness that feels slightly unearned mid-climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with escalation achieved through increasing descriptive density and a cadence shift into the mirror visions. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the final image of the whole crystal ball and blossoming orchard reweights the premise with a felt cost of effort and a promise of renewal. The cost is legible in the "steady breath" and "resolve" required to perform the act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and ice floes are not just atmospheric but actively pressure the choice by isolating the act and providing the crucial resource (the van of mirrors). The crystal ball fragment itself functions as a micro-setting, its evolving state constraining and focusing the protagonist's actions and ultimately charging the final image as it becomes a "tiny sun." Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and purposefully woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres and escalates effectively through the sequence of mirror glimpses, which deepen the protagonist's knowledge and raise the emotional stakes by showing the concrete consequences of failure or success. This accumulation narrows her options to the single necessary act of reconstitution. The cost of focused intention and effort is visible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the reconciliation of brokenness into wholeness through compassionate action, avoiding direct statement until the very end. The final image of the blossoming orchard provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to heal fracture. The slight moralizing in the final paragraph is a hairline slip but is anchored by the concrete image that precedes it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture with a consistent perceptual signature filtered through the peacekeeper's intuitive and observant nature. The controlled use of figurative language ("echoing like a ticking metronome") is voice-motivated and legible. Some register drift occurs in peak beats with phrases like "map empathy onto action," which feels slightly academic for the POV's lexicon, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is highly dense and often beautiful, but this density creates minor momentum drag in high-pressure beats, such as the description of the mirror visions. While generally purposeful, the figurative language occasionally borders on overstacked (e.g., "scattering it into a thousand specks" following "amber flare"). The sentence-level rhythm is otherwise strong and varies effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "shadow-laced peacekeeper," a lighthouse orchard, and a magic system based on vintage store mirrors is highly original and feels organic, not derivative. The core concept of a "courageous anomaly" is transformed from an abstract idea into a specific, pulsing object that drives the plot. The story commits fully to its lyrical, mythic premise.</comment>
