<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The immortal's ennui and subsequent curiosity are concrete and embodied, driving his choice to engage with the amulet. His final decision to step forward is an Earned Stasis, a renunciation of boredom earned by the preceding realization. The "dimensional awareness" trait is present but could be more active in constraining choices earlier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the immortal's understanding of goodbye is reconfigured, with cost felt in the dissolution of his former emptiness. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with escalation driven by increasing sensory and conceptual density around the amulet's pull. The spatial mutiny concept is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The crystalline cavern and prismatic escondite are not just vivid but actively constrain and charge the narrative. The setting evolves from a static prison of boredom to a dynamic lattice of corridors, directly enabling the climax. Sensory details like "scent of ozone" and "hushed thunder" are selective and purposeful, filtered through the immortal's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift—the spatial mutiny—that reweights the dominant stake (discovery vs. safety). The cost is legible as the immortal must say goodbye to his emptiness, a tangible forfeiture. Protagonist agency is clear in his choice to press the amulet and step through.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of "what happens after goodbye" is explored through specific, earned realization rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—that goodbye is a "magnetic pivot"—that reweights the entire narrative. The final image of the universe beckoning is a profound Conceptual Repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through the immortal's ancient, weary consciousness. The voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, elevated register that suits the character. There is a slight tendency toward dense, figurative language in peak beats ("like a lover's sigh"), but it remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "prismatic echoes") and a template cadence in the list of corridor descriptions. However, information density is high, and the language consistently advances character and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic immortality with a deeply personal, philosophical question feels fresh and inevitable. The concept of a "spatial mutiny" is a specific, ingenious inflection that heightens the stakes. The story commits fully to its premise, transforming familiar tropes of the bored immortal through unique, grounded particulars.</comment>
