<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her bureaucratic death, compelling high-stakes choices. Her interiority is concrete and character-specific, with embodied emotion under pressure. The final choice to accept the ghost as a mirror feels earned by prior causality with visible cost. Her emotional progression is realistic, with a credible shift from fear to solace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands on the page with felt cost as Mara's heart aligns with the universe. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through pattern density and a decisive cadence shift. The porcelain shard and ink patterns create a coherent, taught pattern that pays off. A persistent constraint (the ghost's data) shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The opal observatory and snowy setting are vividly rendered and purposefully pressure Mara's isolation. The porcelain shard and ink function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional and emotional priorities. The environment subtly mirrors her internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure building through the ink ritual's density. The cost is legible on the page as Mara risks her mind to the ghost's data. The dominant stake (correcting her death certificate) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. Resolution is earned by her alteration and understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of wisdom from failure emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the ghost's whispers and the final image of the porcelain shard. The piece elicits a concrete emotional aftereffect through scene and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Mara's scientific yet poetic observation. Prose rhythm is controlled under pressure, modulating with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression (e.g., "death-certificate error survivor") is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful. Minor register drift in peak beats ("crystalline whispers") is slight and does not obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of bureaucratic error, digital ghost, and ink-based algorithm feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on familiar themes of identity and technology. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific, verifiable detail creates authenticity.</comment>
