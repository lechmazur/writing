<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong embodied emotion. The final choice to become a conduit is earned by prior causality, though the "analytically artistic" trait could be more visibly contradictory under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost: the promise to return and translate silent stories. Orientation is immediate and the pattern of arrows teaches its logic early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional integration. The starlit vault and pavement cracks are not just descriptive but actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the mapper's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens, with each arrow and the punch narrowing options. Cost is legible in the final promise, a trade-off that forecloses a path of ordinary mapping. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mapping of silent stories. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of hidden narratives without moralizing. The ledger's revelation reweights the premise beautifully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled, lyrical rhythm. POV is stable and the voice is consistent. Some minor register elevation in peak beats ("trembling certainty") but remains within the character's plausible lexicon and supports the tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density and strong propulsion. Minor artifact: a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("framed by ivy that seemed to breathe") creates occasional mild opacity, but clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of urban fantasy and cartography that feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of mapping unspoken truths is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. Bold risk-taking heightens stakes.</comment>
