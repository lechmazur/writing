<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear, rooted in a profound desire to "teach dust to tell stories." Her actions align with this motive, and her final choice to amplify the broadcast is a credible, earned renunciation of her solitary work to become a conduit. A minor deduction for the slightly telling "quiet pride" at the end, which abstracts her embodied emotional state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres through sensory density and pattern breaks (the pirate broadcast, the glowing ink). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Mara's role shifts from copyist to broadcaster, gifting the city a new repertoire with a visible cost—her solitary work is now public. The lens holds, and the final image of the alcove as a "sanctuary" reconfigures the initial silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ember alcove and shortwave radio are not just atmospheric but function as micro-settings that constrain and enable choice. The radio's glow is the story's primary light source and catalyst; the alcove contains the action. The mist evolves from a barrier to a medium that carries the song. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's goal-directed action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens: she transcribes the verses, dons the shawl, and ultimately plays the broadcast. This sequence represents a meaningful cadence shift from private copying to public performance, reweighting the dominant stake (hunger for stories) with a clear cost—her solitary practice is forever altered. The pressure coheres and tightens convincingly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of reviving silenced art through clandestine means emerges organically from the confluence of the story famine, the pirate broadcast, and Mara's motivation. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: dust itself becomes a storyteller. The piece resists moralizing, with the thematic resonance arising from the specific, concrete particulars of the radio, the ink, and the particles of dust.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply embodied in Mara's perceptual signature—noticing through the lens of sound, silence, and light. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity ("flickering like fireflies trapped in amber"). Purposeful compression and elision (the crowd's arrival is handled economically) serve the accumulative drive without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in a few clusters (e.g., "flames trembling like thistles in a breeze" following "thistled calm") which creates a momentary pattern that feels slightly decorative rather than driven. However, this does not obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core concept—a pirate radio broadcast of forgotten music ending a story famine—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. It feels inevitable in hindsight, fully committed to its own logic. The combination of a meticulous copyist and a ragged broadcast is ingenious and transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, avoiding cliché or template plotting.</comment>
