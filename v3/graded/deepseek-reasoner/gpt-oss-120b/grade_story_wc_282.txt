<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear, profound, and intensifies; interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in her whispered interaction with the storm and the fossil. The final understanding—that her role is to amplify existing silence—is earned through on-page causality and carries a visible cost of personal reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the fossil becomes a "living conduit" and the caves "sang." Cost is legible in the final image of the fossil drifting away as a "solitary star," reconfiguring her purpose and the world's song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is a micro-setting that actively pressures and enables the protagonist's choices; the elm leaf fossil and the basin of water are key objects that constrain her actions and decisively charge the final image, making them indispensable to the story's logic and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the act of whispering the storm's name and releasing the final droplet serving as key tightening choices. The cost is felt in the transformation of the fossil and the relinquishment of her created oracle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of giving voice to silence emerges organically from concrete actions and the final image, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the reconfiguration of the fossil and the caves' song.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature. The prose is consistently lyrical and voice-motivated, though a slight risk of overwriting exists in the density of figurative language in peak beats, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail. Minor deductions for a tendency toward dense figurative language in some high-pressure beats ("lantern-like droplets," "heartbeat" pulse) which, while beautiful, slightly risks clarity and leans toward ornamentation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory cartography, a post-human world, and a mystical transitional object is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is committed to fully and executed with bold risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
