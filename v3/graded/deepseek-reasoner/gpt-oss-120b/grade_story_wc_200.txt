<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and a micro-choice (whispering the joke) that reveals her values. However, the trait "modestly fearless" is more told than shown through active trade-offs, preventing a higher score. Her final choice feels earned by prior causality, with the luminous ache serving as a visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the closure is a resonant reconfiguration (sorrow to hope) with clear cost in the "luminous ache" softening. The drive lens holds, and the environment (gorge, harp) acts as a persistent constraint. Orientation is immediate and purposeful, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The gorge and misaligned harp are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's perception. The setting evolves causally with events, turning the water to "liquid amber" at the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a decisive cadence shift (laughter scattering shadows) that reweights the stake. The cost is legible in the transformation of sorrow and the "luminous ache." One meaningful intensification is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of healing grief through laughter emerges from concrete events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the transformed spirits and the "chorus of hope." Subtext operates in implication, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature ("spectral confessions arrived as translucent sighs"). Purposeful compression and lyrical diction are taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift, though some phrases border on ornate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("sunrise glass") slightly muddles clarity but does not harm closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of soul collection, spectral confessions, and laughter as healing feels fresh and organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Some familiarity in the "healing laughter" trope prevents a higher score.</comment>
