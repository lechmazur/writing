<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's contradictory impulses—protecting the harbor versus breaking free—act simultaneously in scene, embodied in her "combative tenderness." Her final choice to unlock the island's heart is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as the scrimshaw detaches and centuries of weight lift. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (unlocking guarded hearts) with felt cost on the page as spirits rise and Mara's resolve solidifies. The causal lens holds tightly: her use of the scrimshaw and song directly triggers the island's revelation and the crystal's unlocking. Orientation is immediate and anchors the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe and the island's phosphorescent cliffs are vivid and purposeful, constraining choice (e.g., wet dock, basalt altar). The scrimshaw itself functions as a micro-setting, its properties directly enabling and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional familiarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens: her decision to sing the whale's hymn and place the scrimshaw on the altar narrows options and triggers the climax. The cost is unmistakable as the scrimshaw cracks and detaches, a tangible price for unlocking freedom. The dominant stake (freedom vs. protection) tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of finding freedom through detachment emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the rising spirits and the island's permanence, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the whale's call and the crystal's pulse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive signature that reflects Mara's worldview. The prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, though a slight register elevation in phrases like "moon-struck daggers" is noticeable but not disruptive. No head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. Minor overwriting exists ("moon-struck daggers" feels slightly ornamental), but it does not obscure causality or closure. Information density is high, and sentences advance multiple layers of story and atmosphere without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a dock worker, a magical scrimshaw, and a disappearing island feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. Risk-taking in the lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
