<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation to "sculpt identity from experience" is clear and consistently drives his actions. However, his defining trait of being "preemptively nostalgic" is more told than shown through dramatized contradiction or cost, feeling like a label rather than an embodied impulse that complicates choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the archivist's insight reconfigures his purpose. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but the causal link between measuring shadows and proving the conjecture about collective memory is asserted rather than demonstrated, creating a slight but perceptible logic gap at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The observatory and solid fog are exquisitely rendered and deeply integrated into the narrative. The crystal forecourt actively constrains and charges the final image, functioning as a micro-setting that is essential to the plot and thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure builds through descriptive density and a cadence shift into the "deepening hush." However, the escalation lacks a clear, agent-driven tightening of options; the archivist's actions feel more observational than decisively pressuring his goal, slightly softening the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of memory and identity emerges organically from the archivist's specific actions and the story's central images. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of shadows as "quiet testament," successfully avoiding moralizing or abstract statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture and a consistent perceptual signature filtered through the archivist's scholarly yet melancholic perspective. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like "preemptively nostalgic," which feels more diagnostic than embodied, but the voice remains largely coherent and compelling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The line-level craft is exceptionally high, with vivid, purposeful imagery and strong rhythmic control. A slight tendency toward synonym churn ("preemptively nostalgic," "lingering echoes") and a paraphrase loop near the end ("deepening hush" is used three times) prevents a higher score, though clarity is never obscured.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core concept of mapping collective memory through geometry is a fresh, ingenious synthesis. The specific combination of a stormlit observatory, a singing crystal, and shadow measurement feels highly original and fully committed to, resulting in a singular and memorable artistic stance.</comment>
