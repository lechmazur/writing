<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's guilt is a consistent, embodied driver that compels the journey and culminates in a credible, earned renunciation. The final choice to seek honesty is motivated by the on-page confrontation with the carvings, and the cost of a lifetime of lies is felt. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward diagnostic language ("genealogy of guilt").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Causal, held tightly: the protagonist's actions are driven by a clear motive and lead directly to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with undeniable cost. The closure lands powerfully on the page with the final image of the ticking watch hand as a "metronome of redemption," reconfiguring his future with a visible price paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and driftwood shore are not just evocative backdrops but active constraints that shape the protagonist's choices and charge the final image. The watch hand is a micro-setting object whose handling is tactile and purposeful, directly enabling the climax. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the POV's urgent, guilt-ridden perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: the act of sifting the carvings tightens the pressure, forcing a confrontation with his own lies. The dominant stake (redemption vs. damnation) is clear, and the cost of the withheld truth is made legible and felt. A single, meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete action of sifting through carvings, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer etched in wood: "the weight of a withheld truth is heavier than any crown." The final image of the watch hand offers a earned, thematic resolution without moralizing, reweighting the premise of memory and truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through the protagonist's specific, guilt-ridden perception. The prose effectively uses compression and patterned language ("sieved hush") that is taught early and pays off. A minor deduction for occasional dense phrasing that slightly obscures immediacy, but never breaks coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. There is a slight tendency toward density and ornate phrasing in a few spots (e.g., "a chorus of old testimonies that the sea refused to remember") that creates minor momentum drag, preventing a higher score, but clarity and propulsion are largely maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The core premise of a "black market genealogist" is a fresh, ingenious synthesis that feels organic and fully committed to. The combination of memory, guilt, and tangible objects (watch hand, carvings) is specific and transformative, avoiding cliché. The story's singular artistic stance and emotional honesty are evident throughout.</comment>
