<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in ancestral connection, compelling her high-stakes choice to rebuild. Her "warmly curious" nature is embodied through tactile exploration, though her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to rebuild is earned, with a visible cost in her patient wandering and the orchard's transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the restored altar reanimates the sacred space, landing with cost in the "quiet voice" of thanks from the bones. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through layered sensory and symbolic density. The persistent constraint of interrupted journeys shapes the final image of merged pilgrimages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is a masterfully rendered micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. The "roots that snake between bones" are a tactile, irreplaceable element that guides Mara's hands and ultimately aligns with the sundial's shadows. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and wholly integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a single, decisive intensification: the act of placing the final stone triggers the chime and the voice of thanks, reweighting the dominant stake of restoring faith with a clear, felt cost. This is driven by Mara's agency, though the pressure coheres more through pattern than causal tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of excavation and reconstruction, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about mending fractured faith through patient work. The final image of "purposeful wandering toward a shared sunrise" reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the whispering bones and humming roots.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in the lyrical, observant prose. The voice modulates effectively with the enchanted tone. Some minor decorative flourishes ("pale rivers of memory") slightly dilute the line-level propulsion in early paragraphs, but clarity and control under pressure are strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. A few instances of slightly overwrought phrasing ("pale rivers of memory") and a template cadence in the list of her activities ("excavating a tomb, each layer...") create minor momentum drags, but these artifacts do not touch the powerful closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a catacomb orchard and a diaspora returnee feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of interrupted journeys is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. The risk-taking in tone and setting heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
