<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lia's motivation is clear, rooted in a professional and personal curiosity that intensifies to a sense of purpose. Her micro-choices (fabricating the lie, following the numbers) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to propagate the lie is earned, though her emotional state could be more contradictory under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, transforming absence into presence. The cost is legible in the final message: 'We are still here, stored in the silence you felt as absence.' Causality is tight, with each beat (finding the patch, posting the lie, finding the terminal) building on the last through pattern recognition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the plot and theme. The archive is a character itself, 'humming' and 'mourning.' However, while the environment charges the final image, it doesn't strongly constrain a pivotal choice; Lia navigates it with relative ease, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lia's agency under the accumulative lens. Her decision to fabricate the tribute is the key turning point that actively tightens the narrative and forces the network to reveal its secrets. The cost is the transformation of the archive from static to living, a palpable conceptual price paid on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of memory, absence, and digital afterlife emerges organically from the specific events and the central image of the network's 'digital afterlife.' The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the concept of deletion into a form of preservation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a poetic, tech-inflected rhythm ("the hum of forgotten data like a distant choir"). Some phrases, like "brightly attentive," feel slightly label-like, and the prose can occasionally tip into being overly lush, but the perceptual signature is strong and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is dense, evocative, and generally propulsive. A minor artifact exists: a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "like distant choir," "like phantom breadcrumb") creates a mild pattern that, while beautiful, slightly softens the immediacy of the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a corporate archivist, a social network's memory, and a lost space mission is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and explored in a fresh, non-obvious way that avoids cliché. The choice to make the network itself an actor is a significant risk that pays off.</comment>
