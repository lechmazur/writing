<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archivist's interiority is concrete and particular, embodied in actions like feeling the locket's "cold hinge." His motivation to "preserve the weight of small moments" is clear and intensifies under pressure. A credible endurance is earned, though the final choice is more a crystallization of his purpose than a high-stakes alteration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the archivist's ritual renews the covenant, landing with undeniable conceptual cost ("history beats in the smallest of things"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure escalating through a decisive cadence shift and density increase at the tide's turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The blooming jetty and locket photo are not just vivid but essential, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and purposeful, filtered through the archivist's professional bias ("each step measured as if the wood beneath him remembered").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a meaningful cadence shift as the tide turns and "cold water lapped at his boots," forcing a stance crystallization. The dominant stake of preserving memory is tested, and the cost of this eternal vigil is felt in the "mournful hymn" of the jetty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the covenant's regeneration, offering a resonant, non-literal answer on the power of memory without moralizing. The final image of the archivist writing a "new chapter" reweights the premise, tying the preservation of "small moments" to the lighthouse's operational magic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature that marries the archivist's thoroughness with the jetty's melancholy. The prose's rhythmic, lyrical quality is consistent and heightens pressure, particularly in the closure beat ("the words rose like lanterns in the night’s embrace").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic propulsion. Minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats ("taste of both dread and delight"), but it is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design. No loops or scaffolding artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mystical archivist, a regenerating covenant, and a haunted setting is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is committed to fully and transformed through specific, grounded details like the walnut ink and the locket's hinge, creating a singular artistic stance.</comment>
