<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The recluse's empathetic core is consistently embodied, driving his choice to seek the library to understand his past mistake. His internal conflict—"staying while leaving"—is a strong, concrete contradiction that charges his final realization. However, his emotional state is occasionally rendered in abstract, diagnostic language ("enlarged tranquility"), preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative lens, with the final insight reconfiguring his relationship to his sanctuary and grief. The cost is legible in the final image of carrying grief into the world. A minor causality break occurs when the curator's sudden appearance and question ("why he had come to hide his own doubts") feel slightly unmoored from the established, invitation-driven premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally integrated and purposeful. The library as a "dimension stitched between shadows and sunlight" is a vivid, active constraint that pressures the protagonist's choice to surrender noise. The final image of the market at sunrise is charged by the prior setting work, reweighting the entire environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift from hesitation to action, culminating in the library's revelation. The dominant stake (unearthing wisdom from a mistake) is tested and deepened. However, the escalation is slightly softened by the curator's overly convenient guidance to the exact solution, reducing the protagonist's isolated struggle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of wisdom found through embracing error is fully integrated and emerges from the core concept of nested paradoxes. The final, non-literal answer—that one must carry grief without discarding sanctuary—is earned and resonant, avoiding moralizing. The concept is explored with complexity through specific events and images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through the recluse's perceptive, melancholic worldview. The patterned elision ("staying while leaving") is taught and pays off. A minor register drift occurs in phrases like "enlarged tranquility," which feels slightly elevated beyond the established voice, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is largely lush and purposeful, with high information density. However, figurative language occasionally stacks into slight overwriting ("a chorus urging him"), and a template cadence emerges in a run of sentences starting with "He" in the middle beats. These minor artifacts do not obscure closure but dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a secret library, nested paradoxes, and a personal quest for redemption is fresh and organic. The core concept transforms a familiar trope through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. The resolution feels inevitable in hindsight, a mark of high ingenuity.</comment>
