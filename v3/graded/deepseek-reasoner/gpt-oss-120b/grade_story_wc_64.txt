<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gardener's blithe nature is embodied through action ("humming a low lullaby," "smiled, blithe once more") and his motivation to discover intentions is clear and drives his choices. However, interiority occasionally leans toward abstract thematic statement ("intention was a shape") rather than concrete, contradictory emotion under pressure, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres through increasing sensory and symbolic density, culminating in a potent Conceptual Repricing where the shape of intentions is revealed as a circle. The cost is legible in the condensation of centuries into "a single point of purpose," and the drive lens holds firmly throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, masterfully establishing a velveteen gloom. The antique case functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image. The cobalt silo, while atmospheric, primarily serves as mood-setting backdrop and does not materially constrain a choice, preventing a top-tier score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the gardener's agency in decoding the tapestry, which deepens his knowledge and reweights the stakes under the Accumulative lens. The cost is felt in the "pressure of centuries condense into a single point of purpose," a clear on-page price for the revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of intention and memory emerges organically from the concrete action of decoding the tapestry, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: intention is a "seed, waiting to be planted in the soil of memory." The final image reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a consistent, lyrical perceptual signature ("velveteen gloom," "uncharted echoes"). The prose effectively modulates with emotional intensity. A minor deduction for occasional elevated diction that slightly strains the gardener's plausible lexicon ("errant note of a long-forgotten song").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variation and information density. A minor deduction for a potential paraphrase loop in describing the case's compartments ("tenderly organized" / "rhythm of his careful hands") and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats, though it remains coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The combination of a cemetery gardener decoding intentions through a magical tapestry is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The concept is fully committed to and executed with high specificity, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking with lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
