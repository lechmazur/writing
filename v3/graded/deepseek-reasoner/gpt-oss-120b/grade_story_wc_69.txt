<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("expectantly resigned," "quiet thrill"). The final choice to invite participation is earned by prior causality. Minor deduction for the trait "expectantly resigned" not fully constraining a micro-choice under pressure, remaining more descriptive than catalytic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid) with clear cost ("hatred... rusting away," "traveled stillness settle like snow"). The inferred accumulative/textural lens holds. A slight ambiguity in the linkage between the zither's magic and the social change prevents a higher score, creating a minor causality softness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn setting are vividly rendered and pressure choices through atmosphere. The zither's soundhole rosette is a micro-setting that charges the final image, constraining the teacher's action and glowing with thematic significance, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens—her playing and invitation deepen the stakes. The cost of old hatred loosening is legible on the page. The escalation is more thematic than tactical, preventing a 9+ score, but it is coherent and effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of art preserving humanity emerges organically from events and images (zither, choir, silence). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of children learning, reweighting prior material without moralizing. A powerfully executed thematic arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature. The prose rhythm is controlled under pressure, and any elision (e.g., the exact mechanics of "subtracting noise") is taught and pays off in the closure's thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and purposeful, with high information density. Minor figurative over-density appears in phrases like "threading golden threads through a tapestry of silence," creating a slight rhythmic stumble, but it does not obscure causality or closure. Overall, the line-level craft is exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of music, social reconciliation, and a quasi-magical object feels fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking with a lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coheres perfectly, supporting the closure without gimmickry.</comment>
