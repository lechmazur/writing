<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira's "diligently curious" nature is embodied through concrete actions like tracing patterns and whispering phrases, compelling her higher-stakes choice to harness the luminance. A minor deduction for a touch of diagnostic language ("feeling the air thicken with anticipation") in a peak beat, but her final choice is earned by prior causality with visible cost as the light spills silver threads.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the harnessed luminance reconfigures the ship's options with cost legible in the "warm presence" and synced engine hum. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through patterned details. A minor cap is applied as the lens, while functional, lacks the tightest coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The airship and hopscotch board are vividly rendered and purposefully integrated. The board specifically constrains Lira's choice, its squares guiding her actions, and it charges the final image as the luminance spills onto it. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her professional perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens is a single, meaningful cadence shift and density increase as Lira aligns the phrases and patterns, culminating in her choice to draw the chalk line. This decisively reweights the stake of harnessing the light, foreclosing other paths, with cost felt in the engine's new rhythm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of light, language, and discovery, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the synced engine and shifting starling formations, reweighting the concept of guidance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, perceptive texture with a controlled rhythm. There is a slight tendency toward elevated diction ("sociable isolation," "lumina cæli") that, while largely voice-motivated, creates minor register drift in a few spots, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and propulsive with high information density. A minor deduction for mild figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "like a choir of distant birds" following "echoing") and a single instance of potential synonym churn ("stranded luminance" vs. "stray halo").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of an antique airship, cartographic magic, and a polyglot's phrasebook feels fresh and specific. The core concept of mapping light is a non-obvious angle executed with conceptual integrity, and the choice to use a hopscotch board as a magical focus is a singular, ingenious risk.</comment>
