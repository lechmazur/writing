<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The whisperer's motivation is clear and intensifies, but her actions are predominantly observational. The final choice to embed a cameo is a credible micro-choice, though her internal conflict and embodied emotion under pressure are more summarized than dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens is dominant and holds. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the globe pulses brighter, signaling the beginning of a new phase. The cost of her truth-weaving labor is felt, though the final agency shift to the dreamers slightly softens the protagonist's decisive role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The shrine and melted snow globe are masterfully rendered, functioning as a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply integrated with the character's perception and the story's thematic concerns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive cadence shift—the realization she must guide the shards back. This deepens the dominant stake and narrows her options, moving from analysis to active participation. The cost of this new, more direct method is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of wreckage, dreams, and purity. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: truth and beauty are salvaged through collective, careful reassembly rather than individual force. It avoids moralizing, sitting in complex, earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature. The prose's rhythm modulates effectively with the emotional intensity of the beats. Purposeful elision (e.g., the exact "truth" whispered) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is lush and highly atmospheric, but this density occasionally flirts with overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "loom of memory," "choir of quiet light"). While generally purposeful, a few phrases slightly blur sense, preventing a higher score. Momentum remains strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a wreck-diver, ghost whisperer, and dream analyst is fresh and specific. The core concept of reassembling a physical object through subconscious fragments is ingenious and feels inevitable in hindsight, fully committing to its own unique logic and stakes.</comment>
