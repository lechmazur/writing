<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is rich and specific, with her personality molting trait actively shaping her choices and contributions to the rebellion. Her final micro-choice of welcoming newcomers with a penny is a perfect crystallization of her established identity. Rook provides effective secondary pressure, though his interiority is less defined than Lira's.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is clear and held. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) where the library is physically and symbolically rebuilt, with the cost of sustained effort legible in the transformed space and growing community. The pattern of accumulation—from manifesto to seeds to rebuilt shelves—is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The rusted library is a masterful micro-setting that actively constrains and enables the central action of rebuilding. It evolves from a broken space to a living sanctuary, its transformation directly charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and perfectly filtered through the poetic, hopeful POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a clear density increase: from receiving the tin, to reading the manifesto, to planting seeds, to attracting vagrants. Each act deepens the stake of rebuilding a new world, with the final image of travelers arriving serving as a decisive cadence shift that confirms the rebellion's success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central action of forging beauty from anarchy. The final image of the library as a "garden in stone" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this premise. The concept is fully integrated, resisting moralizing in favor of a complex, earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, poetic, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature. The accumulative, lyric mode is taught and legible. A slight risk of overwriting in the denser figurative passages ("veins of light, a fracture that illuminated hope") prevents a higher score, but clarity is never broken.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly textured, with excellent rhythmic control. However, a tendency toward dense metaphor clusters ("a trembling candle against night," "whispered applause") creates minor momentum drag in early paragraphs, slightly working against the accumulative drive. The line-level craft is otherwise exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "blooming resistance" cultivated through storytelling and personality molting is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with remarkable specificity, transforming familiar tropes into a singular, authentic vision.</comment>
