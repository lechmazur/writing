<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Corin's reflective nature drives concrete choices (polishing quartz, angling plates) that reveal hierarchy of values. His final realization about the library-not-prison paradox is earned through dramatized struggle, with visible cost in time and focus. Embodied perception avoids diagnostic speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of light/echo study intensifies to cadence shift at crystal insertion. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "soft, luminous sound" storing wonder. Orientation anchors early; causality remains tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Marble cavern constrains choices (light angles, echo resonance) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposefully selective (phosphorescent moss, rusted arch). Spatial choreography coherent; environment evolves with the harvest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (harvesting echoes) escalates through protagonist's agency under accumulative lens: study → crystal fabrication → timer restoration. Cost is visible in jar-filling and time investment. One meaningful tightening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (preserving wonder through reason) emerges organically from concrete actions. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in paradox of "cellar of reason" storing ephemeral wonder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV stable with distinct perceptual signature ("chorus that seemed to ripple outward like a tide of whispers"). Syntax modulates with pressure; no head-hopping. Lyric compression is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("tide of whispers") but clarity maintained. No loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of echo-harvesting and reverse-engineering concepts. Specificity in quartz crystal and reflection angles avoids quirkiness. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
