<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's watchfulness and motivation are concrete, embodied in her actions with the pigments and the scroll. The donor heart's rhythm provides a unique, character-particular interiority. The final choice to guard stories is a credible renunciation earned by her discovery, though the immediate shift from revelation to action feels slightly rapid, costing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pressure building through pattern and density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands on the page with clear cost in her promise and the loom's activation. The only minor slip is a slight ellipsis between reading the scroll and her vow, but the final image reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house and the valley mist are not just backdrop; they actively pressure and enable Lira's choices, constraining her world and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, fully filtered through her POV. The blue morpho wing and the loom function as micro-settings that decisively shape the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification through pattern and cadence shift. The dominant stake (understanding story magnetism) is tested and reweighted by the discovery on the scroll, which narrows Lira's options and forces her stance crystallization. The cost is legible in her promise, a trade-off that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of "iridescent caution" emerges organically from the particulars of the wing, the scroll, and Lira's own nature, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The integration of concept and character is exceptional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent, lyrical perceptual signature. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture that modulates with emotional intensity. A minor register drift occurs in the phrase "quietly explosive insight," which feels slightly elevated for the established voice, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, a pattern of stacked modifiers and slight figurative overload ("quietly explosive" used thrice) creates minor artifacts that, while not obscuring closure, prevent a flawless score. The read-aloud ear test is mostly passed with variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a dye master, a donor heart, and a floating tea house feels fresh, inevitable, and wholly organic to the narrative's logic. The core concept of "iridescent caution" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
