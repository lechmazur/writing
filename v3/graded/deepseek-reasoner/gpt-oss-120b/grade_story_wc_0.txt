<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s characterization is strong with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure, particularly her shift from cosmic to microscopic focus. Her motivation to "strip needless drama" is dramatized through her actions and reflections, though the neutron star researcher detail feels slightly ornamental rather than deeply constraining her present choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing where decay is revalued as data. The cost is felt in Mara’s humility and the greenhouse’s transformation. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the lens holds consistently, though the final beat is slightly more declarative than fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is not just backdrop; it actively constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara’s scientific POV. The decaying wood and dust patterns are integral to the plot’s causality and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara’s accumulated observations, which reweight the stake from ruin to data under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible in the greenhouse’s physical transformation and her relinquishment of cosmic drama for humble, gradual change. One meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of cosmic and microscopic change, avoiding moralizing. The final image of dust rearranging offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the line “We are all dust, rearranged” edges toward thematic echo, slightly softening the impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, scientific voice that modulates under emotional pressure. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic quality that supports the accumulative design. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are not applied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. A minor register drift occurs in the phrase "garden ghosts," which feels slightly poetic against the otherwise precise scientific lexicon, but it does not significantly harm clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a neutron star researcher studying butterfly dust in a decaying greenhouse is fresh and non-obvious. The core concept of gradual change is transformed through specific, grounded choices that feel inevitable in hindsight, and the risk-taking coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
