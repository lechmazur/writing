<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique perception of time, compelling her higher-stakes design choices. Her internal conflict is shown through her retrocognitive entrapment, though this trait could be more actively constraining within the scene. The final moment of tactile understanding feels earned, with visible cost in the dissolution of the photographs. A slight deduction for the retrocognitive trait feeling more like a label than a constant, embodied pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the texture of time becoming palpable and the maze completing its purpose. The cost is legible in the vanished photographs, leaving "only the scent of their memory." Causality is tight, with the halo fragment and hyperbolic geometry taught early and paying off at the end. The lens holds perfectly from the accumulative build to the final, resonant image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is indispensable, actively constraining and enabling Mara's choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply integrated with the POV's professional focus, from the "breathing" walkway to the "vaporous threads" of disintegrating photographs. The hyperbolic geometry is a brilliant micro-setting that redefines spatial and temporal possibilities. The environment is the story's crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the garden's responsive, accumulative textural shifts under pressure from the wanderer's presence, narrowing Mara's options toward the final, inevitable completion. The dominant stake of dissolving temporal boundaries is signaled early and deepens through the disintegration of the photographs, a meaningful cadence shift with a visible cost. Agency is demonstrated through Mara's design and witnessing, foreclosing the path of static perception.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of time's fluid nature emerges organically from the core concept and specific imagery, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the completed maze as a "reverie that quaked with the promise of endless discovery." Subtext operates powerfully in the dissolution of the photographs and the garden's responsive blooming. The integration of mathematical concept (hyperbolic geometry) with emotional truth is exceptional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through a designer's eye for geometry and texture. The prose has a distinct, lyrical rhythm that modulates with the scene's pressure without losing coherence. Purposeful compression ("a Möbius strip of foliage") and patterned diction are taught early and pay off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly dense, often performing multiple jobs of advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Rhythm is controlled and varies effectively. A minor deduction for occasional moments where the density of figurative language ("a quaking reverie that blended the scent of rain‑kissed earth with the distant echo of forgotten songs") slightly risks ornamentation, though it remains largely purposeful and legible. No loops or scaffolding issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of hedge maze design, non-Euclidean geometry, and a metaphysical exploration of time is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through with impeccable logic and emotional specificity. The risk-taking in style and subject matter heightens stakes and coherence without becoming gimmicky. A fresh, authentic vision.</comment>
