<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's wistfully pragmatic nature is embodied in her careful, goal-directed actions with the vines. Her motivation to instill light is clear and drives the entire narrative, though her internal contradiction (protected vulnerability) is more stated than shown through simultaneous conflicting impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the harbor accepts her offering, reconfiguring the night's potential. The Accumulative lens holds, building through sensory density and a cadence shift. Cost is legible in the final image of the vines' persistent glow as a promise against dread.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The luminous harbor is a micro-setting that actively pressures and enables Mara's choice, constraining her to the fire escape and pier. The lockmaster's tool and the vines function as key objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and purposefully filtered through her perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a single, meaningful cadence shift as the "quivering hush" settles into a "steady breath," decisively reweighting the stake of dread versus safety. The cost is the visible forfeiture of her time and effort, and the vulnerability of her offering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of pragmatic hope nurturing fragile light emerges organically from the core action of planting luminous vines. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image of the harbor reflecting both lanterns and the gardener's glow successfully reprices the concept of care.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mara's perceptive, slightly lyrical voice. The prose has a distinct rhythmic texture, though a slight over-reliance on figurative language creates minor register drift in peak beats ("moon's argent ribbon"). No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor artifact: a paraphrase loop exists between "quivering hush lingered" and "hush that trembled," and the phrase "moon's argent ribbon" feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon in a key moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a fire escape gardener using a locksmith's tool to plant light is a fresh, non-obvious concept that feels inevitable in hindsight. The specific, lived-in details of the harbor and the ritual elevate it beyond a simple metaphorical premise.</comment>
