<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("cautious exuberance of a child discovering a secret garden"). Her motivation to restore trust is clear and intensifies, compelling higher-stakes choices. The final renunciation—her whispered promise—is earned by prior causality, though the "carefully reckless" trait is more stated than fully dramatized under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong causal drive lens: each glyph decodes because of the previous promise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the archive breathes anew, with cost legible in the "weight of renewed covenant" she accepts. Orientation is immediate; the pattern of interconnected promises is taught and pays off impeccably at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The archive and ink well are micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("air smelled of dust and forgotten promises"). The environment evolves with the action, and the ink well's properties directly enable the climax. Exceeds the 9+ gate by constraining tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring trust) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: each deciphered glyph narrows options and raises the cost of failure. The final cost is felt in the "weight of renewed covenant" she accepts, altering her future tactics and charging the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of broken and restored covenant emerges entirely through event and image, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "symphony swelled, heralding the dawn of trust." Subtext operates in the ink's song and the glyphs' whispers, embracing complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive signature. Diction remains within the arcane linguist's lexicon. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture that modulates with emotional intensity. Minor register elevation in peak beats ("cautious exuberance") is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, figurative language is pervasive in high-pressure beats ("storm trapped in stone," "symphonies of truth"), creating minor density without pattern-teaching. This slight ornamental weight prevents a 9+ score, though closure remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of linguistic magic and emotional stakes feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "interconnected promises" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and method. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens meaning without gimmickry and coheres perfectly.</comment>
