<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Dusk Noticer's motivation to preserve hope is clear and consistent, driving his choices. However, interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure; his emotional state is more summarized than embodied in contradictory, irrational ways during the key discovery. His final choice to record a new video is earned, but the internal struggle leading to it is not fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the stone humming as a beacon, landing with a felt cost of luminous regret melting into gratitude. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with escalation through pattern recognition. A minor orientation issue exists: the "blooming library above clouds" is evocative but its physical and social rules remain slightly ambiguous, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The library is vividly rendered and the river stone constrains choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Sensory detail is lush and purposeful. However, some elements (e.g., "blooming vines") feel slightly decorative rather than fully integrated into the POV's urgent perception, preventing a top score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens—his decision to align the stone with the footage creates a meaningful, decisive intensification. The cost of "luminous regret" is legible on the page and directly tied to his actions. The stake (preserving hope) is clear and tightens effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of preserving hope against oblivion emerges organically from the specific actions and images, particularly the mirrored motions of the children. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the kite soaring, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The integration of "luminous regret" and gratitude is complex and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture with a strong perceptual signature ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer"). The prose rhythm is controlled and modulates effectively with emotional intensity. There is no head-hopping or register drift. The elision of how dreams become shareable is purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally clear, but suffers from minor overwriting and a clustered figurative language artifact in high-pressure beats (e.g., "metamorphose his perception, letting the past and present merge like watercolor skies"). This creates a slight muddle and momentum drag, though it does not fatally obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core premise of a librarian above clouds preserving hope through shared dreams and archived footage is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The combination feels organic and singular. Points are deducted for the slightly familiar "lyrical librarian" archetype, though it is transformed by the specific, high-concept setting and stakes.</comment>
