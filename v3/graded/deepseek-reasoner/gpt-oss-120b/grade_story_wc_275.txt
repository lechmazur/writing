<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's pacifism and perceptiveness are embodied through concrete actions (sheathing blame, offering a petal as a compass) that reveal a clear hierarchy of values. Her motivation to "weave continuity" is dramatized and intensifies under pressure, compelling higher-stakes choices that alter the community's state. The final renunciation of violence is earned by prior causality with a visible cost—the collective vow to protect. A minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated "senselessly perceptive" label, though it is largely shown through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of the community stepping forward reweights the prior chaos with undeniable conceptual cost—the burden of resilience. The lens holds tightly; each beat deepens the thematic stake through pattern and cadence shift (sandbag→anchor, rose→compass). Orientation is immediate, and cost is legible in the elder's "weight of history" and the community's silent vow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert rose farm function as a micro-setting that constrains choice (Lira uses the environment to inculcate values) and charges the final image (dome shimmering with engraved patterns). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Lira's perceptual signature (e.g., "roses trembling with possibility"). The oasis and sandbag scraps are integrated into action, evolving causally to become anchors of hope.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens: her decision to repurpose the sandbag scrap and inculcate the roses deepens the stake, forcing a trade-off between past weight and future continuity. The cost is unmistakable in the collective vow and the elder's burden. Pressure coheres through density increase (repetition of "tranquil blaze," "weight," "anchor") that reweights the dominant stake without requiring causal turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—sandbag scraps become bridges, rose petals become compasses—avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to chaos through the image of "weaving continuity," reweighting prior material without statement. Subtext operates in gesture (sheathing blame, offering a petal) and image (thorns glinting like sheathed swords). The tranquil blaze motif is earned through specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("eyes senselessly perceptive to the smallest tremor of wind"). Rhythm controls pressure, modulating between breathless accumulation and calm resolution. Purposeful elision (e.g., the tower's fall) is taught early and pays off at closure. A minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("inculcating plants with values") that slightly clashes with the otherwise embodied voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density (e.g., "engraved quiet etched into the canvas like a prayer"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with Lira's actions and breathing with reflective moments. A −0.1 deduction for subtle template cadence in the repeated "tranquil blaze" phrase (three instances), though it serves pattern payoff. No figurative muddle or loops obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes post-apocalyptic resilience with ecological hope through specific, grounded choices—pacifism expressed through horticulture, ballast as anchor. The core premise offers a fresh angle on familiar material, with risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure that heightens stakes. The integration feels inevitable in hindsight, with no derivative echoes. +0.2 within-band bonus for unconventional structure that coheres.</comment>
