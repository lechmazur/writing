<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously ("confidently uncertain," insulating with facts while yearning). The final renunciation of craving applause is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closing image of quiet resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of quarry dust and quiet echo reconfigures the protagonist's stance with undeniable cost. The pattern of sensory and emotional accumulation tightens decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer and speaker grille cloth function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the POV's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a single, meaningful cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake (purpose after shame). The cost of foregoing past validation is legible in the final, quiet resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</theme><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of purpose, reweighting the concept of "after the applause" through the final image of the valley's echo. Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful compression and elision taught early. POV is stable and voice is coherent, with diction and syntax reflecting the narrator's specific mindset and profession.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density and clear propulsion, though slight overwriting risk in phrases like "confidently uncertain" and "measured and boundless" creates minor figurative muddle. No loops or scaffolds obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of roadie and appraiser feels inevitable. The core concept of "after the applause" is transformed through grounded, lived detail, and the quiet, accumulative risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
