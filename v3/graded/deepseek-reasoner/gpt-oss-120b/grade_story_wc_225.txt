<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices (fidgeting with stones) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of guilt is earned by prior causality and has visible cost. Contradictory impulses of "calm rage" act simultaneously in scene. The emotional progression is realistic, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost on the page ("watching it dissolve"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through pattern density and cadence shifts. A persistent constraint (the woven hush/frayed threads) shapes tactics and the final image. Orientation is clear and taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth and woven tapestry are not just described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image, qualifying for the 9-band. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV's chess-based perception. The time-frozen village supplies a coherent pressure that affects the protagonist's tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a single meaningful cadence shift (the final breath at the altar) that reweights the dominant stake. The cost of letting go is legible on the page. Pressure coheres and grows through the increasing density of chess and weaving motifs until the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of forgiveness through the final image of the "woven hush" becoming a "banner of peace." Theme emerges organically from the integration of chess and weaving motifs, resisting tidy morals. Subtext operates powerfully in image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, chess-infused perceptual signature and strong rhythmic control. Purposeful elision (the exact decoding process) is taught and pays off. A minor register drift occurs in the peak beat with the phrase "fierce repose," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional with high information density and clear propulsion. Read-aloud rhythm is strong and varies naturally. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "fierce repose" is repeated, creating a slight template cadence, but it does not measurably obscure the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess strategy and a mythological labyrinth feels organic and fresh. The core concept of a "woven hush" is a specific, non-obvious inflection that heightens stakes. The story commits fully to its premise, and the final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
