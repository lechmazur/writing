<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The courtesan's motivation to defy conformity is clear and consistent, though her interiority leans abstract ("bodily poetic rhythm"). Her actions align with her motive, and the final renunciation is earned, but the lack of concrete, embodied contradiction under pressure prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative lens, landing with undeniable conceptual cost as the city's "lullaby shattered." The linkage through pattern and cadence shift is coherent and the final image reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The silver courtyard and prism sanctuary are not just vivid but essential, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully integrated into the action, with the environment mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift and density increase as echoes are harvested. The dominant stake (defying conformity) is clear, and the cost of her effort is legible in the reweighted narrative, though the escalation is more textural than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the courtesan's actions and the prism's symphony, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of conformity vs. individuality, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and controlled, with a consistent lyrical texture. POV is stable, and the patterned, poetic elision is taught and pays off at closure. Minor register elevation in peak beats ("alarming serenity") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly poetic and dense, but risks overwriting with frequent figurative language. While generally purposeful, some phrases ("sigh of a lover long gone") verge on decorative. The rhythm is controlled and supports the accumulative momentum, though clarity suffers slightly in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "chaste courtesan," a "harvest of echoes," and a "prism sanctuary" is fresh, non-obvious, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully committed to and executed with a singular artistic stance, transforming familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
