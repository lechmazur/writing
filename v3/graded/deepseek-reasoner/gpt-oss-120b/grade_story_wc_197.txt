<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's quiet resolve and resourcefulness are concrete and consistent, compelling her higher-stakes choice at the transmitter. Her final act of endurance is earned by prior causality, with the visible cost of her solitary vigil at the water's edge. A slight deduction for a minor over-reliance on label-like descriptors ("underestimated") in the closing paragraph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, with pressure building through dense imagery and pattern breaks toward a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The cost is legible in the final image of Mara's solitary silhouette. A minor orientation delay in the first paragraph prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The auric lagoon is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image as a "living chart." Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action, with the environment subtly mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, culminating in a meaningful cadence shift with the broadcast. The cost is felt in the reweighting of collective memory against the regime. A single, sufficient tightening meets scope expectations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of coded resistance emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The final image of the lagoon as a "living chart" reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in the lyrical, observant prose. The voice modulates effectively with pressure, though a slight register elevation in peak beats ("auric shimmer") creates a minor, consistent drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in the description of the transmission's effect and a slight synonym churn ("revising histories," "revised histories").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mystical map, a salvaged key, and a coded broadcast feels fresh and inevitable. The concept is fully committed to and executed with high specificity, transforming familiar rebellion tropes through grounded, lyrical choices.</comment>
