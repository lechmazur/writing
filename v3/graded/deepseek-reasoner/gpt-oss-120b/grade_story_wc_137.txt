<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's contradictory impulses—skepticism versus wonder—act simultaneously in scene, embodied in precise micro-choices like offering tea to the wind. Her final peace is earned by the disciplined transcription work, a credible endurance with visible cost in her softened eyes and the tile's final calm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) landing with felt cost as peace settles in Lira's bones. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through pattern density and cadence shifts. The tile's final, steady glow is the exact on-page image where cost is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tower and magic tile function as micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Lira's perception, such as the sea's mist and the tile's glow. The environment is inextricably woven into the narrative's causal and emotional logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the Accumulative lens, as her transcription deepens the stakes of memory preservation. A single, meaningful cadence shift occurs as the tile aligns with the whales' song, reweighting the dominant stake. The cost is legible in the final peace she earns, a trade-off for her disciplined work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of doubt and wonder entwining emerges organically from Lira's specific struggle with the tile. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the symphony is a feeling to inhabit. This reweights prior material without moralizing, achieved through the concrete image of the alcove as a lighthouse for thoughts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that filters the world through Lira's curious yet logical mind. The prose rhythm modulates beautifully with pressure, from whispered apologies to the final, calm resolution. Purposeful elision (the exact mechanics of the tile) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, though minor overwriting appears in peak beats (e.g., "unheard symphony of stone, sea, and stars" risks abstraction). Rhythm and sentence variety are expertly controlled, propelling the accumulative density. A single hairline slip in figurative coherence prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of magic square, whale migration, and memory is a fresh, non-obvious combination that feels inevitable in hindsight. The specific, lived detail of transcribing forgotten patterns transforms a familiar trope. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
