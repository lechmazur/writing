<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her character, compelling high-stakes choices. Her "brazen calm" is embodied through systematic action under pressure, not told. However, the final choice's motivation relies slightly on an off-stage council, and her internal contradiction under the deadline could be more dramatized on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear cost: the council's decree is lifted, a decisive change. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through pattern and density. A minor deduction for the council's off-stage presence slightly weakening the on-page causal pressure at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The temple orchard and living stone pillars are indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, purposeful, and deeply integrated into action and theme. The setting is a primary actor, not a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The six-month deadline provides coherent situational pressure, and Mara's work escalates the stakes. The cost of her effort is felt in the community's response. However, the primary antagonist (the deadline) remains largely abstract, and the council's reversal, while earned, happens swiftly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies dialogue emerges organically from concrete actions (copper wiring) and the final image, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. It avoids moralizing, instead achieving profundity through the specific, lived-in world and its reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature ("bruised amber," "chlorophyll clouds"). POV is stable and deeply fused with the protagonist's worldview. The prose's rhythm modulates expertly with the story's calm yet urgent pace.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on compound adjectives ("gently systematic," "brazen calm") and a near-paraphrase loop between "brazen calm" and "inspired others to ignore fear."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of biocultural architecture, a caretaker's deadline, and copper-wire symbiosis is highly original and feels inevitable. The concept is committed to fully and executed with specificity, avoiding cliché. The risk-taking with a quiet, accumulative plot heightens the stakes.</comment>
