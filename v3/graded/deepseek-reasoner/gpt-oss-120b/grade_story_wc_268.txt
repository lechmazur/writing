<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The titan's motivation is clear and regally unpretentious, but interiority is occasionally abstract ("felt a quiet pride that was both grand and modest"). A final micro-choice (tucking away the crown) shows character, though the emotional cost of the collapse is more told than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong causal drive lens holds from inciting incident to closure. The decisive change (unmasking, temple's collapse) occurs on-page with clear cost (spent ink pellet, spectral fading). Orientation is immediate and the closure's felt cost is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory detail ("scent of old papyrus and inevitable collapse"). The library setting pressures the search and the iron gall ink pellet charges the final image, though its constraining role in choices is occasionally secondary to atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmasking the pretender) is clear. Escalation is driven by the titan's agency (seeking the pellet, following the map). A meaningful tightening occurs when the rune flares and the floor sunders, forcing the climax with a visible cost (the temple's collapse).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus deceit emerges organically through the central action and objects (ink pellet, crown). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("power taken by deceit would always crumble") that reweights the prior search without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct, consistent perceptual signature with a mythic register. POV is stable. Some minor register drift occurs in peak beats ("presence that felt almost planetary"), but the elision of the pretender's dialogue is purposeful and supports the tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical, high-density prose with strong rhythm. Minor figurative over-density in places ("a hushed cathedral of stone and dust," "almost planetary") slightly slows momentum but does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A fresh, specific synthesis of mythological elements (diminutive titan, truth-telling ink). The core premise is transformed through grounded, tactile details and a non-obvious resolution centered on a quiet, earned revelation rather than combat.</comment>
