<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is strong, with clear motivation rooted in her past as a crisis actor and survivor. Her internal contradiction—feigning terror yet feeling it—is embodied in her "benevolently ruthless" resolve. The final choice to chronicle small gestures is earned by her established desire to "unbind the silent pact between memory and oblivion," with the weight of the scroll providing a felt cost. A slight deduction for the "nomadic penumbra" feeling more thematic than character-driven in its interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is clear and held throughout, with pressure building through Mira's patterned walking and the gallery's responsive echoes. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she achieves peace knowing she's "given voice to the unheard," with cost legible in the "weight of those gestures." The interregnum backdrop is slightly underutilized as a pressure source, but the core structure is flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is vividly rendered and actively pressures the narrative, amplifying sounds and inhaling/exhaling to charge the final image. The chessboard's "luminous absence" constrains choice by its missing pieces, directly shaping Mira's mission. Minor deduction for occasional over-written description (e.g., "vaulted whispering gallery" feels slightly ornate), but the setting is integral and tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens—each walked pattern intensifies stakes and triggers the gallery's response. The cost is legible when the "weight of those gestures settle on her shoulders" after the scroll is revealed. A slight deduction as the interregnum's societal pressure remains abstract, but the personal stakes are clear and compelling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through Mira's actions and the recurring motif of "small gestures," resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to memory's value through the scroll's contents and Mira's vow to preserve the "minutiae that kept them alive." The integration of "luminous absence" and "nomadic penumbra" deepens the thematic weight without exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a poetic, measured rhythm that suits the tone. The prose modulates effectively under pressure, e.g., "echoing walls seemed to inhale and exhale." Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("half-remembered prayers"), but the voice remains coherent and purposefully elevated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and sensory detail, though occasionally dense ("benevolently ruthless resolve"). Figurative language is generally purposeful, but phrases like "nomadic penumbra" risk slight abstraction. No loops or scaffolding issues; momentum is well-maintained through varied sentence structures.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a crisis actor, missing pawns, and a whispering gallery feels fresh and inevitable. The "nomadic penumbra" is a bold risk that largely pays off by pruning "grand narratives." The story commits fully to its premise, with specificity in details like the child offering a blanket elevating it beyond template.</comment>
