<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a legacy that feels authentic. Her interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the tactile handling of the film negative. The final choice to accept and share the burden is earned, though the moment of understanding ("she understood") leans slightly toward summary rather than pure dramatization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Structure is accumulative, building to a resonant reconfiguration where the wall's dream is revealed and Lira's role is redefined. Causality is sound, with the discovery of the diary and film leading directly to the climax. The closure lands with a clear, felt cost—the weight of history settling on her—and the lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is exceptional, functioning as a primary character. The ivy-veiled passage and the film negative are not just described but actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the protagonist's perception and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from curiosity to a profound, costly understanding. The dominant stake (discovering the dream) is clear and tightens meaningfully. The cost is legible in the final image, though the initial internal conflict could be slightly more pronounced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the echo-mapping and the film negative, exploring memory, legacy, and shared history. The final image of the "collective imagination" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the handling of objects and echoes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Lira's perceptive consciousness. The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a perceptual signature that filters the world through her archivist's sensibility. The prose rhythm is controlled and purposeful, effectively modulating with the story's emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly accomplished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for a slight tendency toward decorative language in a few phrases (e.g., "green-threaded artery," "warm ash against her spine") that, while beautiful, momentarily risk overshadowing momentum. Overall, clarity and propulsion are excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise of an echo cartographer mapping what walls dream about is strikingly original and fully committed to. The synthesis of concept, character, and setting feels inevitable and fresh. The risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative mode pays off with a unique and memorable perspective.</comment>
