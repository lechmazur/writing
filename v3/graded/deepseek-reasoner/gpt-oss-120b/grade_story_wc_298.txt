<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maelia's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a desperate need to mend her soul. Her "dusky resolve" and "reckless idealism" are embodied through concrete actions like carving sigils and pressing soot into roots. A slight deduction for a moment of diagnostic self-awareness ("recognizing the first thread of repair") in a peak beat, which briefly abstracts the embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, achieved as the amber thread weaves through the marrow, patching Maelia's soul and reconfiguring the orchard's purpose. The cost is legible on the page: the burnt card is a "reminder of sacrifice." The lens holds from start to finish, building meaning through layered imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The gnarled root coiling around vertebrae forces Maelia to kneel and press the soot, a key tactical move. The setting's evolution—from sorrowful to breathing easier—is fully integrated into the action and the story's closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maelia's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, each ritual act intensifying the stakes toward a final, decisive infusion of hope. The cost is unmistakable: the dissolution of the tarot card, the literal sealing of her pact. A single, meaningful cadence shift is sufficient and effectively executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of bartered destinies, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: renewal is found not in mere trade but in shared stitches that bind. The final image of the amber thread as a lantern perfectly encapsulates this complex thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical signature. However, a tendency toward slightly overwrought phrasing ("glittered against the dust‑laden air") creates minor register drift in high-pressure beats, preventing a higher score despite strong rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally purposeful, but suffers from minor figurative overload in the opening. The phrase "reckless idealism that glittered against the dust‑laden air" is a mixed metaphor that slightly obscures clarity. Otherwise, sentence-level propulsion and information density are high, with no loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a catacomb orchard and bartered destinies is fresh and specific, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through to its logical, emotionally complex conclusion, transforming familiar tropes of sacrifice and renewal into a singular vision.</comment>
