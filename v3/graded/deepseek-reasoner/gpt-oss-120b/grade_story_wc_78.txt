<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Leeward tide prophet’s motivation is clear, profound, and consistently drives his actions. His internal state is rendered through embodied, concrete perception (e.g., "the wood now warm with the memory of each note"), and his final choice to move on is an Earned Stasis that feels inevitable. A slight deduction for a minor tendency toward poetic summary over contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the orchard hums with the prophet's euphony, a decisive change with a felt cost of transience. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with escalation driven by pattern density and cadence shifts. The cost is legible in the "lingering hum that lingered like a promise."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is the story's brilliant, indispensable crucible. The floating orchard on driftwood is not just vivid but actively constrains and enables every choice, functioning as both environment and instrument. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the prophet's specific perception, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a masterful cadence shift and density increase, reweighting the dominant stake of creating harmony. The prophet's agency in refining his "sketched resonance" drives the pressure, and the cost of his effort is felt in the transformation of the orchard itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of transforming obstacles into instruments is fully integrated, emerging organically from the prophet's actions and the story's central concept. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the humming orchard, reweighting all prior material without moralizing. It embraces complexity through the cost of transience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly suited to the prophet's perception. The prose rhythm is controlled and modulates with the action. A minor deduction for occasional register drift into elevated diction that, while beautiful, slightly distances the reader from peak immediacy in a few phrases.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is lush, rhythmic, and highly evocative, with excellent information density. However, it occasionally flirts with overwriting; a cluster of figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a cascade of silver threads destined to dissolve into silence") creates a slight muddle, applying a patterned-artifact penalty that prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise is stunningly original and executed with full commitment. The synthesis of a floating orchard, a cloud-reading prophet, and a theory of "sketched resonance" feels both wholly unique and inevitable. The risk-taking in voice and concept heightens stakes and coherence without ever becoming a gimmick.</comment>
