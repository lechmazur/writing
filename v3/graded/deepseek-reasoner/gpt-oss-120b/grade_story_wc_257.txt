<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, embodied grief. Her micro-choices, like tracing the stencil onto the rose, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. A minor deduction for a hint of diagnostic label-speak ("teach the withering of her own spirit to bloom"), though it is quickly anchored in concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid) with undeniable cost felt in the rose's revival and her tears. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with pressure building through layered images (crane, thread, rose) that culminate in a decisive cadence shift. The final image of the new crane promises continued renewal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The observatory is not a backdrop but a crucible that constrains and enables choice, its telescopes and furnaces actively shaping the protagonist's tactics. The origami crane and vellum stencil function as micro-settings, charged objects whose specific properties are essential to the plot's mechanics and the story's closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens: finding the stencil, folding the crane, following the thread, and reviving the rose. Each action deepens the central stake of renewal, narrowing her options and culminating in a visible cost—the sting of loss giving way to the promise of new sap.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</theme><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central paradox of "genuinely artificial" renewal, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the glowing rose and the scattered cranes, reweighting prior material (mourning, artifice) without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through the jeweler's perceptual signature, with a distinct, lyrical texture. A minor register drift occurs with the phrase "genuinely artificial," which feels slightly manufactured for the theme, but this is a hairline slip that does not obscure clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush but precise, with high information density and rhythmic control that accelerates and breathes with the scene's needs. A single, minor paraphrase loop exists ("curtains of intention" is explained within two lines), but it does not obscure causality or dull the powerful closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of mourning jewelry, origami, celestial coordinates, and a tattoo stencil is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept of "curtains of intention" is transformed from an abstract idea into a tangible story mechanism, committing fully to its premise without retreat into safety or cliché.</comment>
