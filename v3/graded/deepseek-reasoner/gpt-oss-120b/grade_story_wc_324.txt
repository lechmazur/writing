<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in the "persistently curious" trait, compelling higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final promise to guard the echo is an earned renunciation with felt cost. However, the "contact tracer for hearts" concept feels slightly abstract, leaning on a professional label rather than fully embodied action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through layered imagery to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on the page with clear cost: the weight of "incidental heroism" and the promise to guard echoes. The lens holds perfectly, with the scanner's pulse and the choir's hymn creating a decisive cadence shift that reweights the stake. The persistent constraint of the fading signal shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and the hearing aid function as micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the POV's professional bias. The environment guides the action, with the vaulted corridors and marble statues subtly mirroring the internal state of remembrance. The hearing aid's circuitry is a tactile, lived-in object crucial to the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, following the pulse to its source. The dominant stake of protecting vulnerable voices is signaled early and tightens through a meaningful cadence shift with the choir's hymn. Cost is legible in the narrator's shouldering of "incidental heroism." However, the pressure feels more atmospheric than actively complicating, lacking a tangible, immediate threat to narrow options further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete action of tracing a pulse to save a voice. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of remembrance without moralizing. The concept of "incidental heroism" is fully integrated into the narrative's events and the protagonist's final stance. Subtext operates powerfully in the whispered gratitude and the statues bowing in reverence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in the lyrical, elegiac prose. The voice is consistent and modulates effectively with emotional intensity. The non-standard, poetic syntax is voice-motivated and legible, teaching its pattern early. A slight tendency toward overwrought phrasing ("cartographer of sighs") prevents a higher score, but the control under pressure is exemplary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and controlled, with strong rhythmic variation and information density. However, some figurative language strains coherence ("the sky itself whispered through the stone") and creates minor muddle. A template cadence emerges in adjacent sentences starting with "The" in the opening. These artifacts are minor and do not touch the closure beat, but they prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise of a "contact tracer for hearts" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of a hearing aid as a vessel for memory and an atrium as a liminal space is highly original and specific. The story commits fully to its lyrical, speculative premise without retreat. Risk-taking in voice and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
