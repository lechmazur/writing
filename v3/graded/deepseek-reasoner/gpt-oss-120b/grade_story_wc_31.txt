<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, poetic yearning. His micro-choices under pressure (e.g., stepping off the pier, using the key) reveal his values, though interiority occasionally drifts into abstract phrasing ("luminous vow") that slightly distances the reader from embodied emotion at peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a clear before/after and a felt cost of endless seeking. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density. A minor deduction for a slight lens ambiguity mid-story, where the causal mechanism of "wandering purposefully" to find the exact ship is somewhat elided.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is exceptionally vivid and purpose-driven, fully integrated into action and choice. The pier, the sunken ship, and the library are not just backdrops; they actively constrain and enable Eli's quest, with the library's floating books directly charging the final image and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through Eli's purposeful actions under the Accumulative lens. The pressure tightens meaningfully as he unlocks the library and opens the book, with a visible cost—the binding of his truth to the key tag, foreclosing a simpler path and committing him to a larger journey.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pursuit of synesthesia and the nature of vows, resisting moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the teal ribbon and the sigil, reweighting prior material without explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistently maintained, with a lyrical, perceptually specific texture. The controlled elision ("by wandering purposefully") is taught and pays off. Minor deduction for occasional ornate phrasing that slightly strains the POV's plausible lexicon under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely exquisite with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "a quiet river of stars," "sleeping leviathan") where figurative language stacks, creating a minor momentum drag without fully obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core premise of discovering the color of sound is highly original and executed with conceptual integrity. The synthesis of a lamplighter, a sunken library, and synesthesia feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight, with bold risk-taking that coheres perfectly.</comment>
