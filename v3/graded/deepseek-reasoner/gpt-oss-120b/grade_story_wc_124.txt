<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in sensory trauma, with micro-choices like checking scents against his coat and uncorking the vial revealing his hierarchy of values. His final renunciation—to catalog aromas of sorrow—is earned by the vial's revelation and his embodied grief. The emotional progression from personal loss to universal mourning feels credible and specific, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. A slight deduction for a minor over-reliance on summary in the final paragraph's resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Arlen's understanding of grief is repriced, with cost legible in his stinging eyes and whispered promise. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density and a cadence shift at the vapor's release. The vial's mechanics are taught early and pay off, though the UV light's introduction is slightly delayed, causing a minor orientation wobble. The final image of crystal shadows clinging to his coat charges the closure with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, with phosphorescent vines pulsing to enable the revelation. Sensory details are purposefully selective and filtered through Arlen's professional bias, such as noticing scents like "petrichor" and "old oil lamps." The environment evolves causally, sighing and humming in response to the transformation. Spatial choreography is coherent, with vapor curling around dead petals and light tracing molecules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens, as Arlen's decision to uncork the vial deepens the stakes from personal grief to universal mourning. The cost is felt in his physical reaction and the whispered promise to catalog sorrow. Pressure coheres through sensory density increase rather than causal turns, fitting the lens. A minor deduction for the UV light's late introduction, which slightly weakens the causal pressure of the method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the collision of scent and memory, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: grief transforms into a "lantern of understanding." Subtext operates in images like the vial sighing and extinct orchids speaking through aroma. The final paragraph's slight summary tendency prevents a higher score, but the emotional aftereffect is concrete and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Arlen's olfactory expertise. Diction remains within his lexicon ("aromatically cautious," "petrichor"). Syntax varies purposefully, accelerating at the vapor's release. The only minor flaw is a register drift in "phosphorescent vines," which slightly elevates diction beyond his likely vocabulary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language ("like mute witnesses," "echo of a summer evening") is purposeful and pattern-taught. Sentences vary in rhythm, breathing with the scene's emotional beats. One minor paraphrase loop occurs ("grieve not only for his mother but for every fragment of history"), but it does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes scent, memory, and extinction into a fresh, inevitable whole. The crystal vial and ultraviolet revealing are non-obvious choices that heighten stakes. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates, grounding universals in Arlen's particular grief. Risk-taking in lyrical density pays off without gimmickry, supporting coherence.</comment>
