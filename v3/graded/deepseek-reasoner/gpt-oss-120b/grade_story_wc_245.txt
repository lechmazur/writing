<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotions and micro-choices that reveal her values. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, though her blindness could be more actively constraining in early beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, with closure achieving a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) through the stillpoint's emotional nexus. Cost is legible in the dissolution of languages into harmonious understanding, and the pattern of musical notes teaches its logic early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is indispensable, constraining choice through its emitted hums and magnetic whispers. The platinum ring and bark knot charge the final image, with sensory detail purposefully filtered through Lira's unique perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency in following the melody and dowsing emotional currents. The cadence shift at the crescendo forces a stance crystallization with visible cost—the dissolution of absorbed languages into unified understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the convergence of languages into emotional understanding. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to navigating interior realms without moralizing, charged by the forest's sigh and Lira's completed soul map.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Lira's blindness and language absorption. Lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure, though minor register elevation occurs in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and rhythmic control. No loops or artifacts obscure closure; figurative language is pattern-taught and supports the accumulative design. Minor register drift in "quiet blaze of inner light" is negligible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of blindness, mapmaking, and ultrasonic perception feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in sensory substitution heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the core premise is fully committed to with conceptual integrity.</comment>
