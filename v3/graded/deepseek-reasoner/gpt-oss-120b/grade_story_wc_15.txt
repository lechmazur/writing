<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The weaver's motivation is clear and her haunting optimism is a consistent, embodied trait that drives her actions. However, her internal conflict and the cost of her choices are rendered more through lyrical summary than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the final image of the labyrinth as a "tapestry of stone and light" reconfiguring its meaning. The cost of breaking precedents is legible in the guildmasters' humbled kneeling. The pattern of stitching light accumulates toward this decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The labyrinth is not merely a backdrop; it is the central crucible that constrains the weaver's action and is fundamentally charged by her work. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's poetic perception, with the stone arch and canyon walls acting as recurring anchors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the weaver's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the stakes deepening as each stitch visibly transforms the labyrinth. The cost is felt in the breaking of the old guilds' precedents and the tangible change in the environment, though the pressure could be slightly more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of transforming ruin into reverence through soft insistence is fully integrated and emerges organically from the weaver's actions and the evolving setting. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the silence of the empty tide pools into a form of song.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, a poetic and perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure. The purposeful elision of the sleepwalking method's mechanics is taught early and pays off in the closure, creating a seamless blend of dream and waking logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is lush and highly rhythmic, with strong information density. A minor deduction for occasional overwriting and a clustered use of figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "whispering a map of forgotten myths...sing a hauntingly optimistic lullaby") that slightly blurs sense, though it does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a weaver, a labyrinth, and a mythic, sleepwalking method of repair is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is committed to fully and executed with a singular artistic vision, transforming familiar tropes into a fresh and memorable whole.</comment>
