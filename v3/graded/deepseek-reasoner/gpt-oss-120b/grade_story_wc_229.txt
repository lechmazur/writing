<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and her emotional state is vividly embodied, particularly in the climax with "screaming tenderness" and tears. However, her internal contradiction is underdeveloped; she lacks a conflicting impulse that would deepen her characterization under pressure. The final choice to crack the cork feels earned but is more a culmination of a single-minded focus than a struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with palpable cost in the sea's "resonant sigh" and the lighthouse's transformed meaning. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building through sensory and vibrational density to a decisive cadence shift. All elements are anchored early, and the linkage from intention to result is seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse and garden scent are not just descriptive but actively constrain and enable Mara's choice, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her perspective, with the vial cork and lantern serving as micro-settings that shape tactics. The environment evolves causally with her actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a meaningful density increase in vibrational and sensory patterns, reweighting the stake of proving whispers' power. Mara's agency drives the tightening, and the cost is legible in the fisherman's guided arrival and the sea's response. The dominant stake is signaled early and paid off with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the confluence of image and action, with the final reconfiguration of the lighthouse as a "heart beating" offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. No moralizing or explicit statement; the power of softened intent is proved through the fisherman's arrival and the sea's sigh, leaving a lingering emotional effect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the accumulative intensity, though some near-poetic phrasing flirts with register drift without fully breaking. No dialogue is present, so evaluation focuses on narrative cohesion and control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control, but suffers from minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "screaming tenderness" risks abstraction). There is no scaffold or loop artifact, and clarity is maintained, but the figurative language occasionally strains towards purple prose without fully obscuring cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core concept of "vibrations of intent" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific, grounded details (vial cork, garden scent) transform a potentially abstract idea into a tangible narrative mechanism. The lyrical risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure image is wholly original.</comment>
