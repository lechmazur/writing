<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The translator's motivation is clear, rooted in a specific worldview ("turning war-torn testimonies into bridges of understanding"). Her internal contradiction ("shrewdly innocent gleam") is shown through action, and her final choice to place the coral's essence on the cast is a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values. The emotion is embodied ("lotus-hearted ache") rather than labeled. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward poetic summary in her interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with pressure escalating through a cadence shift as the anesthetic takes effect, deepening the moment and allowing the "smudged notes [to] glow faintly." The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the "moment of mutual recognition," reconfiguring the relationship and the potential for healing. Cost is legible in the translator's final "sorrowful and sweet" ache. The linkage is tight and the pattern is taught effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and the child's plaster cast function as a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges the action. The setting is filtered through the POV's perception ("the atrium seemed to breathe") and evolves with the plot, the mist coalescing into a "soft chorus of sighs." The brain coral fragment is a key object that charges the final image and is integral to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification: the anesthetic kicking in acts as a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake (healing trauma) and allows the pivotal "decrypting" action. The cost is the translator's emotional burden, felt on the page. The protagonist's agency (tracing the letters, whispering promises) drives the escalation, narrowing the focus to this single, transformative connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of grafting new meaning onto old wounds emerges organically from the core action of decrypting the cast and is embodied by the central metaphor of the brain coral. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the coral absorbing shared anxieties to "grow stronger," resisting a tidy moral. The concept is fully integrated into the narrative's particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity. The narrator's perceptual signature is strong ("shrewdly innocent gleam," "lotus-hearted ache"). There is a slight risk of register drift into elevated diction ("psychic pain of the war"), but it is largely voice-motivated and consistent. The elision of how exactly the notes are decrypted is purposeful and pays off in the thematic closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. There is high information density, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. A minor deduction for a potential artifact: the phrase "shared anxieties" appears multiple times, nearing thematic echo, though it is anchored in the concrete image of the mist and the coral's lattice, mitigating the penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a conflict-zone translator, a child's cast, and brain coral as a metaphor for resilience is fresh and organic, not a checklist. The specific, grounded choices in character and world make the premise feel singular. The central conceit of decrypting physical scribbles to heal psychic wounds is a non-obvious angle executed with conceptual integrity.</comment>
