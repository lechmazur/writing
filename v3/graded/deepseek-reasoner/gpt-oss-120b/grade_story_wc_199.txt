<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, compelling her to higher-stakes actions. Her transformation is earned through on-page causality. However, the characterization lacks significant internal contradiction or a visible flaw that complicates choices, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive, on-page transformation with clear cost ("forever changed"). The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, with each discovery layering meaning. Causality is tight, and the orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the action. The moonstone dust and pool are key objects that charge the final image. It is docked slightly as the environment, while atmospheric, does not consistently constrain choices with tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, with each discovery raising the cost of her quest. The price of her transformation is legible, though the external pressure from the setting remains more atmospheric than actively antagonistic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance and renewal emerges organically from the specific actions and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. The final image of the pact between "human care and forest memory" perfectly encapsulates the theme without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent. The perceptual signature is strong, filtered through Lira's unique worldview. Minor deductions for occasional over-richness in description that slightly slows momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly deliberate, with strong rhythmic control. However, a tendency toward decorative figurative language in high-pressure beats ("leaves that fell like ancient verses") creates minor density issues, preventing a top score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core concept is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of folklore and ecological fantasy. The combination of an orderly seed sorter decoding prophetic leaves feels organic and singular. The story fully commits to its premise with conceptual integrity.</comment>
