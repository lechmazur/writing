<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in specific traits; her micro-choice to mend the ribbon reveals her mender's mindset and sparks the central idea. The final endurance—persisting with the ancient method—is earned by prior causality, with the cost of her renewed purpose felt. The "endearingly feisty" attribute is somewhat tell-y, appearing only as a label rather than constraining a choice with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lira's renewed purpose to care for both quartz and roots, with the cost of this persistence legible. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through layered imagery and a decisive cadence shift at the mending. The breach of contract backstory effectively primes the closure without dominating the present frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice (the thorn snags the ribbon) and charging the final image (light through stained glass, leaves whispering). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Lira's professional POV. The orchard-cathedral fusion is unique and fully integrated into the narrative's logic and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens: the ribbon snag creates a pressure point, and Lira's decision to mend the quartz is a meaningful deepening that reweights the stake. The cost is her renewed vow to persist, felt in the final image. One tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully from events and images—the deciduous vows, the mending—avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "every fracture holds a seed of renewal." The core concept of "accidental wisdom" is integrated through specific experience rather than asserted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature ("light fell like a choir"). The prose has a lyrical, controlled rhythm. A minor register drift occurs in the peak beat with "accidental wisdom dripping onto the child’s mind," which leans slightly abstract for the established voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor artifact appears in the climax: "accidental wisdom dripping onto the child’s mind" is a mixed metaphor that slightly muddles clarity in an otherwise precise passage. No loops or scaffolding issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of guild craft, organic wisdom, and a unique setting. The combination feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure lands with authenticity.</comment>
