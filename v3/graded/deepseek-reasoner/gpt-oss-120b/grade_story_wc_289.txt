<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her actions align with her role as a "keeper of secrets." Her final choice to guide the letters back to the world is an earned renunciation that forecloses a path, though the felt cost of this endurance is slightly abstract. Embodied emotion is strong, e.g., "feeling the thread tug at her heart."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with closure achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The pattern of sensory and symbolic details intensifies to a decisive cadence shift at the climax. Cost is legible on the page in the "gentle sigh" of relief from the pond, making the reconfiguration felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is not merely decorative; it actively constrains and charges the narrative. The thrush’s nest spiral and the lily pond are integral to Mira's choices and the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through her POV, creating a cohesive, pressurized atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, through her interactions with the art installation. A single, meaningful deepening occurs as the spiral responds to her whispered letter, narrowing her options and charging the stake. The cost of her commitment is legible in the final, charged image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of images and actions, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of connection through the final image of the "endless tapestry." Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, such as the lotus petal bearing a stanza.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a consistent lyrical and perceptual signature. The prose's rhythm and diction are controlled and purposeful, modulating effectively with emotional intensity. There is no head-hopping, and any elision feels taught and purposeful within the accumulative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor tendency toward decorative phrasing ("sequined ribbons," "prismatic quiet") creates slight ornamentation in high-pressure beats, preventing a higher score. The closure image remains clear and unaffected by this minor flaw.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core premise of a love-letter ghostwriter interacting with a magical art installation is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The concept is fully committed to and executed with specificity, avoiding cliché. The combination feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
