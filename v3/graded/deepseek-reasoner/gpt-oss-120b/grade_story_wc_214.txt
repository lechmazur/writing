<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The janitor's motivation is clear and rooted in a spiritually curious nature, with embodied emotion ("feeling their sorrow and triumph alike"). However, the internal state lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the progression from yearning to quiet assurance is smooth and lacks genuine struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, crystallizing in the final image of the station's chord resonating with the lantern's pulse. The cost of the janitor's vow is legible in the "subtle tremor" that ripples through the ground, a felt price for the act of empathy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The station and lantern are not just vividly described; they are indispensable micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. The station's hum synchronizes with the cosmos, and the lantern's glow is the conduit for the janitor's central action, making the setting actively shape the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the janitor's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from observation to the active vow. This meaningful deepening reweights the dominant stake of connection, and the cost is made visible through the physical tremor and the binding of sky and stone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</theme><comment>The theme of finding strength in vulnerability emerges organically from the janitor's actions and the final image, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The concept of "flourishing stillness" is fully integrated into the narrative's logic and emotional arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture and a consistent perceptual signature filtered through the janitor's spiritually curious mind. The voice is controlled and purposeful, with rhythmic modulation that supports the accumulative pressure, and any elision feels taught and intentional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor deduction for a potential prose artifact: the phrase "flourishing stillness" is repeated, which, while thematic, slightly trends toward decorative use in its second instance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The combination of a cosmic janitor and a star-tracking station is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable. The core premise is fully committed to and executed with a singular artistic vision, avoiding cliché through specific, grounded detail.</comment>
