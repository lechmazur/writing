<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in specific traits; her final choice to paint the mural feels earned by prior causality with visible cost. However, the townsfolk function as a collective rather than distinct individuals, limiting relationship dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost ("the price had already been paid"). The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through layered imagery and cadence shifts. The orientation is clear early, and the final image reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. The bone towers and pale spire are tactile and actively pressure the narrative; the environment shapes tactics and outcome with high specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a clear cost ("acceptance of loss"). The dominant stake (forgiveness) tightens through Mara's actions, though the pressure from the ritual timeframe is underutilized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete action and image; the final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The concept of refracted truth is integrated through particulars, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; the prose has rhythmic control and purposeful compression. Minor register drift occurs in peak beats ("kaleidoscope that seemed to whisper"), but elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density. Some overwriting appears in high-pressure beats ("refracting the sunrise into a kaleidoscope"), causing minor figurative muddle, but clarity at closure is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of artistic defiance, refracted truth, and bone towers feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the vision is singular and fully committed.</comment>
