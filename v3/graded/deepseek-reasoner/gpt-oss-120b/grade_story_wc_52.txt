<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in specific grief, compelling her to carve. Embodied emotion is strong ("hands cradling... a newborn memory"). A minor slip: "harvest lessons from loss" leans toward telling, but the final choice to place the lantern is earned by the process.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost: the empty space is now a vessel. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory density toward the final image. The constraint of the kettle's boil and the carving process creates a coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The skylight, rain, kettle, and tools are woven into action and perception. The loft's atmosphere is a character itself, evolving with the narrative and mirroring Mara's internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, as the process of carving and crystallizing time deepens the stake. The cost is legible in the transformation of the roar to a sigh and the final act of placing the lantern on the hearth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central action; the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to grief's paradox. The concept of "here and gone" is fully integrated into the narrative's logic and emotional resolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical voice. The prose rhythm is controlled, though occasionally dense. The single character's internal voice is coherent and specific, filtering the world through her particular lens of memory and craft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density. Minor figurative overload in a few lines (e.g., "rain beads... like tiny metronomes") slightly dulls momentum, but clarity is maintained. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief, circus alchemy, and woodcraft is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, resulting in a singular and authentic artistic stance.</comment>
