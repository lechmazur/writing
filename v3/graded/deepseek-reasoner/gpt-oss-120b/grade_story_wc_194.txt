<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lian's motivation is clear and rooted in lineage, with micro-choices (placing his ear, lifting the floorboard) revealing values under pressure. However, the epiphany about the council's betrayal feels slightly told rather than fully earned through embodied struggle, lacking a contradictory impulse in the moment of discovery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the final realization that "ending a line was not about destruction" reweights the premise with undeniable cost. The accumulative lens holds, with pressure building through the intensifying pattern of sound and intuition. The cost is legible in the "deepening" golden shadows and the transformed silence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is a masterclass in micro-setting, constraining choice by housing the audible cipher and hiding the compartment. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Lian's scholarly POV. The gramophone and its standing waves function as a key tool that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lian's agency under the accumulative lens, as his attentive listening deepens into a tangible map and actionable discovery. The cost is felt in the foreclosed path of ignorance, rewarded by the glow of the scroll. A single, meaningful tightening from muse to discovery is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges eloquently from the particulars of sound, silence, and intuition, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer on transforming silence into eloquence. The final paragraph avoids thematic echo by grounding the insight in the specific image of the quiet crank and open scroll.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a scholarly, perceptive texture. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the rising pressure of discovery. Minor register drift occurs in the phrase "eloquently silent," which is repeated and feels slightly elevated for the moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally lush and purposeful, but the phrase "eloquently silent" is repeated three times, creating a template cadence that slightly dulls its impact. This is a minor artifact that does not touch the closure beat but prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound, intuition, and historical reckoning feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of audible history is executed with high specificity and conceptual integrity, transforming the familiar "hidden truth" trope through a unique, sensory mechanism.</comment>
