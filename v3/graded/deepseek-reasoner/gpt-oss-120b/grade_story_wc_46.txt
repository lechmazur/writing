<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("her heart housed a pearl of stillness"). The final choice to become a "keeper of luminous peace" is a credible Earned Stasis, earned by the dramatized act of arranging the glass. The motivation to "share light without using fire" is clear and intensifies, compelling her higher-stakes choice of self-transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) landing with visible cost: she becomes "a quiet keeper," foreclosing her previous path as a watcher. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density and a cadence shift into the final, tranquil image. The cost is legible in her anchored, earthbound state versus her prior longing for distant suns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges the final image, its mist "curling like soft breath" around the glass spiral. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through the POV's perception (e.g., "walls undulated like emerald serpents"). The environment evolves with the action, becoming a participant in the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, through the deepening act of polishing and arranging the glass. The dominant stake (sharing light) tightens into a tangible, cost-driven choice of renunciation. A single meaningful intensification—the pearl's pulse sending "tranquil radiance"—reweights the stake with a visible, felt cost of her transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of sharing gentle illumination emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the "spiral, a miniature sun that could breathe without flame." Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing. The core concept (pearl of stillness) integrates fully with the thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose has a lyrical, textured quality that modulates with emotional intensity ("Each polished facet sang a soft zephyr bloom"). Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, without muddle. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful. Minor scaffold exists in adjacent sentences describing reflection ("reflectively vibrant yet hushed") but does not obscure closure, warranting a small deduction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of celestial longing and earthbound craft. The combination of sea glass, pearl, and grotto feels organic and singular, not a checklist. Emotional truth and human complexity are prioritized over surface novelty. A specific, inevitable synthesis is achieved, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
