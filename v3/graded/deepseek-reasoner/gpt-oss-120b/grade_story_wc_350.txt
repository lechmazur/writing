<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The librarian's "empathetically decisive" trait is vividly embodied in her conducting gestures ("vigorous and tender, like a mother guiding a newborn through storm"), compelling higher-stakes choices. However, the characterization lacks internal contradiction or a visible struggle that would complicate her flawless, saintly competence, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the city's unified breath and singing silos reconfigure its meaning with undeniable cost felt in the workers' "eyes wide" and "murmurs of gratitude." The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, with each linguistic strand and wooden plank building pressure toward this final, cost-laden image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower and grain silos are vividly rendered and filtered through the POV's priorities, with the "borrowed starlight" and "low rumble" creating a rich atmosphere. However, while the setting supplies resources (the clock weight), it does not actively constrain a pivotal choice, capping the score below the 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the librarian's agency under the accumulative lens, with the interspersing of languages deepening the stakes and forcing a visible trade-off—the workers' emergence and the physical construction of bridges. The cost is legible in their widened eyes, charged by the final image of the city breathing as one.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of healing division through art emerges organically from the concrete action of weaving a "tapestry of sound" and building literal bridges etched with verse. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "silos now singing bridges of hope," reweighting the industrial landscape without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice possesses a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature ("a spiraling citadel of gears and constellations") and maintains consistent rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful elision (e.g., the exact mechanics of the clock weight) is taught early and pays off in the closure's conceptual repricing of time.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly lyrical and dense, but minor overwriting occurs in high-pressure beats with stacked metaphors ("like a mother guiding a newborn through storm"). A slight register drift in phrases like "empathetically decisive" feels mildly diagnostic, though it does not obscure closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a choral librarian, talking grain elevators, and an astronomical clock is a fresh, non-obvious angle on healing urban division. The choice to use interspersed languages as the method for bridge-building feels inevitable in hindsight and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
