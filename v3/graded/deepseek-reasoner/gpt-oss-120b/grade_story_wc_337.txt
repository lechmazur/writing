<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in her unique profession, with micro-choices (pressing the needle, whispering the secret) revealing her values. Her internal state is embodied and specific, though the emotional progression is more serene than contradictory, lacking the irrational hypocrisy that would push it into the 9+ band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held throughout. Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis, landing with palpable cost as the "lucid unrest" settles into "purest peace" and the net collapses. The final image of the mask thrumming with a soft pulse is a perfect, cost-legible endpoint for this lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and fisherman's net are not just described but function as the crucible for the entire ritual, actively constraining Elara's actions and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's perception and the story's action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through the cadence shift of untying each knot, each release intensifying the "interlaced hush" and reweighting the stake toward peace. The cost is the protagonist's expended focus and the tangible settling of the spirits, though the pressure is more meditative than actively coercive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central action: that grief can be tenderly unraveled into peace. The final image of the mask and the "muted hymn" of starlight offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this central question without moralizing, perfectly integrating concept and event.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture and a consistent, close third-person POV. The voice is controlled and purposeful, with a perceptual signature that filters the world through Elara's restorative, silence-accumulating sensibility. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, but risks density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a lucid unrest, a calm yet uneasy feeling"). A few sentences border on overwriting, slightly muddying the crystalline clarity required for the highest band, though rhythm and propulsion remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise—exhuming grief by untying knots in a net with a silence-accumulating needle—is strikingly original and fully committed to. The synthesis of concepts feels inevitable and fresh, executed with a high degree of specificity and authentic vision that avoids cliché.</comment>
