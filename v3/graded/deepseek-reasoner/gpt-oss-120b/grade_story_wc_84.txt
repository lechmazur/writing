<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and her "sharp-eyed" trait is demonstrated through her piloting. Her "perpetually surprised" nature is shown but could be more active in constraining choices. The final choice feels earned, though her internal contradiction could be more pronounced in the moment of action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (the shared song of belonging) with clear cost: the reweighting of identity and the pilgrim's departure. Orientation is immediate and the pattern of star trails is taught early, paying off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The observatory is a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables the central action (following star trails). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through Lira's scholarly POV. The "brilliant dimness" is a recurring, charged atmospheric element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the density of sensory and thematic pattern. The dominant stake (decoding belonging) is tested by the precise, guided action of the drone. The cost is the pilgrim's departure and the new responsibility Lira vows to guard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of belonging emerges organically from the concrete action of decoding the frequency. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the concept of "missing pieces" as internal and collaborative. Avoids moralizing, landing on a profound conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, scholarly voice. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture. Some minor register drift occurs in peak beats (e.g., "articulate the word belonging without uttering a syllable" edges toward diagnostic language).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for figurative density in high-pressure beats, which occasionally risks abstraction (e.g., "frequency of belonging that bound all wanderers to the stars"). No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of ancient observatory and drone technology feels fresh and organic. The core concept of a "frequency of belonging" is a specific, non-obvious angle on a universal theme. The ending's emotional truth and specificity avoid generic templates.</comment>
