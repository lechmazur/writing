<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selene's motivation is clear and rooted in her specific trait of colorblindness, compelling her to barter for hues. Her "innocently cunning" nature is shown through her schemes with the plants. The final choice to create a mural from shattered reflections is earned by her prior actions. However, the trait "innocently cunning" is more stated than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the courtyard awakens and Selene's perception is fundamentally altered. The Accumulative lens holds, with pressure building through repeated bartering beats. Cost is legible in the final image of the glass flowers, celebrating imperfection. The orientation is immediate and the pattern is taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The courtyard and reed tongue function as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables Selene's choices, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, purposeful, and filtered through her unique perception. The glassblower's furnace and the cracked vase are integrated into action and theme. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Selene's agency under the Accumulative lens, with each barter deepening her perception and raising the stakes. The cost is the trade of "perfect symmetry" for "cracked, asymmetrical grace," made legible on the page. A single meaningful intensification is sufficient for this length, and it culminates in the courtyard's full awakening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of finding beauty in imperfection emerges organically from the specific events and images, most powerfully in the final mural of "shattered reflections." It is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative. The glassblower's final statement avoids moralizing, instead crystallizing the theme through concrete analogy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that reflects Selene's perception. The voice is consistent, with syntax and rhythm modulating effectively under pressure. There is a strong perceptual signature in how color is translated into other senses. Minor risk of overwriting in a few densely figurative lines, but clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly lyrical and dense, but generally purposeful and advancing the story. Rhythm is controlled and varies effectively. A minor deduction for occasional overwriting and stacked metaphors that slightly blur sense in high-pressure beats (e.g., "cadence of shadows and the whisper of metal"). However, no major loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core concept of "bartered awakenings" is a highly original and organic synthesis of magic, artistry, and perception. The combination of a colorblind painter and a speaking reed feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its premise, and the specific, verifiable details create a memorable and authentic vision.</comment>
