<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mapkeeper's motivation is clear, rooted in his role, and intensifies as he actively seeks the stone. His actions are embodied and character-particular, especially when tracing the ice patterns. The final choice to place the stone feels earned by his prior, careful work. A minor deduction for a slight lack of internal contradiction or a deeper, conflicting impulse beyond his singular focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with pressure building through sensory density and pattern until a resonant reconfiguration is achieved. The closure is a clear Earned Stasis, with the "bloom of hush" providing a decisive change from storm to calm, and the cost is legible as the energy beings drift away. The linkage from examining ice to finding the tunnel is a clean, motivated ellipsis. The final image of the mapkeeper smiling beneath the stone is a charged, resonant payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are not just a backdrop but the central mechanism of the conflict, actively pressuring the protagonist. Key objects—the ice patterns and the echo chamber stone—constrain his choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, masterfully balanced across sound, sight, and touch. The setting evolves causally with the stone's activation, melting the ice patterns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is a single, decisive intensification of resonant frequencies that reweights the dominant stake of finding quiet. The mapkeeper's agency is clear in his deliberate actions to locate and deploy the stone. The cost is visible on the page as the energy beings dim and drift away, their vibrant presence subdued. The pressure coheres perfectly from the initial disturbance to the final, calming resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of balance between sound and silence emerges organically from the core concept and the mapkeeper's final realization. It is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative, moving from seeking the absence of sound to understanding its harmonious balance. Subtext operates powerfully in images like the melting ice patterns and the energy beings becoming a "murmur." Avoids moralizing, allowing the final image to carry the thematic weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply filtered through the mapkeeper's specialized perception, creating a distinct, consistent voice. The prose has a lyrical, rhythmic quality that mirrors the story's subject matter. There is a slight, occasional drift into a more elevated narrative register that doesn't fully align with the POV's embodied, tactile experience ("hammered repose"), preventing a higher score. However, the control is largely exemplary, and the voice is compelling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and beautiful, purposeful rhythm. A minor deduction for a hint of overwriting in a few peak beats; phrases like "hammered repose" and "gently luminous" are effective but risk feeling slightly decorative upon repetition. The sentence-level propulsion is excellent, and the final paragraph lands with clarity and powerful resonance. No loops or scaffolding issues were found.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core concept of a sonic ecosystem requiring balance is fresh and ingeniously executed. The combination of elements—harmonic caves, a mapkeeper reading ice fractures, an echo-chamber stone—feels organic and singular, not derivative. The story commits fully to its premise, following its implications to a satisfying and authentic conclusion. The specific, verifiable detail (e.g., tracing crack patterns) creates a memorable and grounded perspective.</comment>
