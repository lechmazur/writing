<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to prove listening heals is clear and drives her choices, though her internal contradictions under pressure could be more dramatized. Her final stance feels earned through the accumulation of stories, but her initial reaction to the whisper lacks a micro-choice that reveals deeper conflict. The embodied emotion is strong, particularly with the locket's "cool memory."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot builds through pattern and density toward a Charged Poise closure where the courtyard's calm holds steady. The cost is legible in the final image of the child's hope. The mailbox discovery is slightly convenient, but the linkage through listening justifies it. Orientation is clear by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The courtyard and locket function as micro-settings that charge the final image and constrain choice. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful ("wet stone and incense," "pale gold" dawn). The environment subtly guides Mara's actions and mirrors her internal state without overt symbolism. The locket's tactile presence is particularly effective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation occurs through the accumulative pressure of the whispered stories, each deepening the stake and narrowing Mara's focus to listening. The cost is felt as the world's noise fades with each story. However, the external pressure of the "intruding city" remains vague and doesn't concretely challenge her tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of listening healing emerges organically from the locket's mechanism and the letters' discovery. It avoids moralizing until the final paragraphs, where it becomes slightly explicit ("listening truly healed"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the child's request and the echo of the sea.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Mara's perceptive, curator-like sensibility. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture, though some sentences verge on overly lush ("the metal’s cool memory"). Dialogue is minimal but functional when the storyteller speaks. The voice remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory density. Minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "the metal’s cool memory press against her palm," which slightly obscures immediacy. A few sentences could be more concise, but there are no major loops or scaffold artifacts. The closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core concept of a locket that requires listening to unlock community stories is fresh and well-executed. It synthesizes magical realism with a quiet, character-driven premise. The specific details of the thrift shop and the whispered names ground the concept in a particular, lived-in world.</comment>
