<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The curator's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority occasionally slips into summary, particularly during the philosophical breakthroughs, which are told more than embodied under pressure. The final choice to accept the paradox is earned by the preceding causal chain of inquiry and revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) that reweights the premise of knowledge itself, landing with a felt cost of "brightened disquiet." The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure escalating through density increases and cadence shifts in the bathroom beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The astral orchard and ancient library bathroom are not merely vivid backdrops but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The orchard's trees bend toward him, and the bathroom tiles rearrange, making the setting a direct participant in the narrative's causal and thematic mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency to inquire, which leads to the key tightening beat in the bathroom. The cost is legible as his disquiet is both brightened and unsettled, a trade-off that reweights the dominant stake of pursuing knowledge under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of nonlinear knowledge emerges entirely through event and image, culminating in the resonant, non-literal final image of the constellation map. The ending offers a complex answer to the central question without moralizing, embracing the paradox of "brightened disquiet."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a controlled, lyrical texture that modulates effectively under pressure. The patterned elision of the orchard's answers ("between the first and last page") is taught early and pays off at closure, enhancing the thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "pond of starlight"), but it does not obscure closure clarity. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bewildered curator, an astral orchard, and philosophical breakthroughs in a library bathroom is a singular, non-obvious, and fully committed artistic vision. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices that feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
