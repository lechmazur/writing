<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s characterization is deeply embodied and consistent, with her blindness not as a label but a constraint that shapes her methods. Her motivation to "decode feedback into direction" is dramatized through her tactile, auditory engagement with the drone. The final moment of calm assurance is earned by her successful on-page struggle, though the emotional cost of her endurance is slightly less sharp than the technical triumph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing Mara’s assurance and the hummingbird’s new purpose. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through sensory density and the external deadline of the lifting anchor. The cost is legible in the final image of the drone hovering, a promise paid for by her focused labor. Causality is tight, with the repair directly enabling the drone’s flight and the ship’s new path.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot is indispensable, its vapor transforming light into a precise tool for Mara’s work. The setting actively pressures and enables her choices, from the fogged windows to the vibrating anchor chain. Sensory detail is exquisitely selective and filtered through her unique perception, making the environment a character in its own right that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (repair the drone to guide the ship) and escalate through the looming departure, tightening Mara’s focus. The dominant stake is tested and proven in the successful repair and hover. Agency is clear, though the external pressure of the anchor is more a complicating coincidence than a force that directly narrows her on-page options, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of broken technology and human sensory ingenuity, exploring the bridge between limitation and vision. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this central question without moralizing. Subtext is rich in the mist’s "quiet partnership" and the promise of "luminous futures," though the phrase "magnetic calm" slightly approaches thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied in Mara’s perception, with a distinct perceptual signature. The prose has a lyrical, textured rhythm that modulates with the scene’s calm intensity. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on compound sentences in peak beats, which very subtly softens the prose's propulsion at its most critical moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly sensory, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, figurative language is extremely dense, appearing in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats ("magnetic calm," "quiet sigh," "tiny prisms") without a clear pattern-teaching payoff, creating a minor but consistent artifact that slightly mutes clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a blind artisan using refracted light and water to repair a scout drone is a highly original, non-obvious concept that feels inevitable in hindsight. The specific lived detail of the depot and the moral calculus of repair versus pure function anchor the premise in a singular vision. Risk-taking in the accumulative, sensory-driven structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
