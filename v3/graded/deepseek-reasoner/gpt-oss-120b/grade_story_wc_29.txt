<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is clear and her motivation to outwit the tricksters drives the plot. Her cautious hope is a consistent trait that informs her delicate interference. However, her internal conflict is more stated than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene, and her competence slightly outweighs her struggle, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plot's causal structure is strong, with Mara's actions directly leading to the community's shift. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where her hopeful watchfulness becomes a new, earned state. The cost of her vigilance is felt in the final image of her perpetual readiness. The inferred lens is Causal and holds firmly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The university radio station is a superb micro-setting that actively pressures choices and supplies the core resource for the conflict. The "old console" and "astronomical charts" are tactile, purpose-driven details that charge the final image. Sensory selection is excellent, reflecting Mara's professional focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Causal lens, from plotting pulses to active interference. The stakes—preventing chaos and fostering unity—are clear and tested. The cost of potential failure is palpable, though the resolution of the false alarm via her method is slightly convenient, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through event and image, exploring the balance between chaos and order, division and unity. The concept of "ethereal grit" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a profound and earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mara's professional, analytical consciousness. The voice has a distinct, textured quality that blends the technical ("subsonic frequencies") with the poetic ("canvas for the celestial signal"). The perceptual signature is consistent and compelling throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with vivid, purposeful description and good rhythmic control. Minor deductions for occasional near-duplicates ("cautiously hopeful" appears three times) and a slightly ornate phrase ("the ethereal grit of the world settle into a steady beat") that feels slightly abstract at a key moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic conflict and campus politics is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept of using subsonic radio interference as a weapon against celestial tricksters is highly original and executed with bold risk-taking that fully commits to its premise without gimmickry.</comment>
