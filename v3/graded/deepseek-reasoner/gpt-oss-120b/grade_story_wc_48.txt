<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is strong ("conflicted yet resolute") and embodied through micro-choices like recording the poet's laughter. The final endurance is earned, but the doubt ("gnawed at the edges") is summarized rather than fully dramatized under peak pressure, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost ("solemn promise"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through pattern and cadence shifts. The seashell fragment and mist act as persistent constraints that shape the final, charged image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The feral nexus and mist are not just atmospheric but actively pressure choices and constrain movement. The spiral seashell fragment functions as a micro-setting, its physical properties guiding her actions and charging the final image decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost made legible as she "solemnize[s] each encounter." The pressure coheres and tightens through the gathering of hopes, though the final cadence shift is slightly more declarative than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of binding hopes against the current emerges organically from concrete actions and the final image. It offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the act of creation itself through the cost of her solemn promise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the perceptual signature is distinct ("swirling hush," "pulse like a held breath"). The lyrical compression is taught and paid off at closure. Minor register consistency questions in phrases like "lucidly watchful" prevent a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, but slight overwriting appears in stacked metaphors ("pulse like a held breath," "swirling hush"). This creates minor figurative muddle in early beats, though clarity is maintained at the crucial closure moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core concept of a novelist collecting hopes in a feral nexus is a highly original, non-obvious synthesis. The risk-taking with a lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coheres perfectly, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
