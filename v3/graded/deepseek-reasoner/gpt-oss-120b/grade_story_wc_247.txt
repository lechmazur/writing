<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and profound, rooted in a specific, character-defining worldview. His "joyful sorrow" is an embodied, contradictory emotion that charges the climax. However, his internal conflict and the micro-choices under pressure are rendered more through lyrical summary than simultaneous, contradictory impulses acting in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing (CR): the final image of Lira feeling the harbor's response reweights the premise, revealing Arlen's technique was not a one-time event but a living thread. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building pattern upon pattern of silence and light. Cost is legible in the "joyful sorrow" and the promise to "keep mapping silence," a felt price for this ephemeral art.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The luminous harbor is not a backdrop but the story's central crucible; it actively responds to Arlen's gestures, constraining and enabling his art. The setting is filtered through a unique perceptual signature, where silence is a "language" and waves are "silver sighs." The camera and the pier are micro-settings that charge the final image, with the lens-etching on the dock serving as a tangible relic of the performance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a clean cadence shift: the pattern of mapping silence intensifies into the harbor itself becoming a "living stave." The dominant stake of soothing souls is tested and deepened by Lira's arrival, proving the music's permanence. Agency is clear in Arlen's deliberate choreography and Lira's vow, though the cost of their artistic endurance is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of crafting beauty from absence and void emerges organically from the core concept and Arlen's actions, never stated directly. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lira's discovery, reweighting the prior events without moralizing. The paradox of "joyful sorrow" perfectly encapsulates the story's complex emotional truth, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is exceptionally distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive signature that filters the world through the grammar of silence and light. The prose rhythm is controlled and purposeful, modulating to match the serene yet charged atmosphere. The switch to Lira's POV is handled cleanly at a section break, maintaining coherence under the dominant accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exquisite, with high information density and poetic precision. Sentences like "each ripple a silver sigh" do multiple jobs of atmosphere, character, and theme. There is no scaffold or loopiness; every image advances the narrative. A single minor deduction for the slightly summary-like description of the harbor's listeners ("fishermen... dolphins") which briefly abstracts the effect of the music.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of sign language, a filmless camera, and mapping silence into music is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is not a gimmick but is fully committed to and explored through its implications for character and theme. The quiet, lyrical risk-taking perfectly heightens the stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
