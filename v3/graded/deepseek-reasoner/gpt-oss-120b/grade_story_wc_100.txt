<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlow's motivation is clear and rooted in his vocation, compelling his high-stakes choices. His interiority is concrete and character-particular, though his "inadvertently stubborn" trait could be more actively dramatized in his micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation is earned, with a visible cost as his silhouette merges with the light, foreclosing his own path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens is dominant, with pressure building through density and cadence shifts. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the library is repriced from a tomb to a sanctuary, with cost legible in the final image of Marlow vanishing. The pattern is taught early and pays off with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The submerged library is an indispensable, active environment that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through Marlow's professional POV. The setting evolves causally with the light's pulses, its pressure a constant force on the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by textural density under the accumulative lens, with a single decisive intensification as the light surges and the sighs rise. The dominant stake (giving rest an address) is reweighted with a visible, felt cost—Marlow's own dissolution into the space he created for others.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept and imagery, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of rest. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity through the paradox of Marlow's sacrifice creating an "oasis of silence."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The voice is consistently lyrical and elegiac, modulating with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is exquisite with high information density and clear propulsion. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a high-pressure beat ("chased stillness" appears twice, risking decorative repetition). However, no loops or scaffold artifacts obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of undertaker, lighthouse, and submerged library feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is fully committed to and followed to its logical, poignant conclusion. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative mode heightens stakes without becoming a gimmick.</comment>
