<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is deeply personal and consistently drives her choices; her spatial gift is not just a label but actively constrains and enables her actions. The two Lucs present a compelling internal conflict, and her final choice is earned by prior causality with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction for a slight diagnostic tone in "spatially gifted," though it's quickly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost—the fusion of the Lucs reconfigures Maya's grief and the farm's purpose. The hybrid (causal/accumulative) drive lens holds strongly, with each discovery narrowing options. The orientation is immediate and functional, and the ending image lands with undeniable conceptual and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom farm is indispensable, actively constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid and selective ("sapphire-lit caps," "spores swarmed his outline like fireflies"), deeply integrated into action and POV. Spatial choreography is flawless, and the environment is a crucible for the central conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the hybrid lens, with each laser pointer click and discovery tightening options. The stakes are deeply personal and escalate to a climax with legible cost—the potential loss of a brother or an echo. The final choice forces a trade-off with visible emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief and replication emerges organically through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "letting go" through the fusion image. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence (e.g., Luc's trembling hand). Avoids moralizing; embraces complexity and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Maya's perceptual signature ("nested topographies"). Prose rhythm is controlled and purposeful, modulating with pressure. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven ("You're early"). Elision (e.g., the farm's exact mechanics) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains clarity and propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("quiet wildfire"). Minor artifact: "spatially gifted" has a slight label-like quality, but it is immediately dramatized. Rhythm and syntax are varied and support emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of sci-fi and grief narrative. The concept of "permeable barriers" and topological folds is fully committed to and transforms familiar tropes. Emotional truth and specificity avoid generic templates. Risk-taking in structure and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
