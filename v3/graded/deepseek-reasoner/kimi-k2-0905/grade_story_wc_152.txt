<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her internal contradiction (wisdom disguised as foolishness) is shown through specific actions like stitching comets as vectors. The final choice to confront the conspirators is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when the lieutenant draws his pistol. Embodied emotion is strong, e.g., "synchronized her heartbeat to the echoed silence."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly; closure is a decisive change (coup thwarted) with felt cost (lieutenant's trembling hand). Orientation is anchored by line 2 ("observatory dome above her"). The method of "adjacent possibilities" is taught early and pays off at closure, reconfiguring options without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful; the cobalt observatory and eternal candle constrain choices (candle's flame ignites the hidden map) and charge the final image. Sensory details reflect POV bias, e.g., "stitching Andromeda’s spiral arms" under professional priority. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing coup) is signaled early; escalation is driven by protagonist's agency (embroidering hidden truths, confronting conspirators). Cost is legible when "the pistol lowered" after the reveal. Pressure tightens through a meaningful turn (projection of the map) that narrows options for the plotters.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme (unheard stories, wisdom in disguise) emerges organically through images and actions, e.g., "listened for unheard stories hidden between star-threads." Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the new stitched stars representing possibilities. No moralizing; complexity embraced through the embroiderer's quiet victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, precise voice. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (e.g., her "quavering voice" to deceive scholars). Diction remains within character lexicon; syntactic variety supports rhythm. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is strong ("echoed silence").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and polished, with zero artifacts or loops. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously, e.g., "the flame from eternal candle beneath the lens ignited the hidden layer." Rhythm varies naturally; metaphors cohere. No scaffolding or redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of embroidery and political intrigue; premise feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking (lyrical prose, quiet protagonist) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Tropes transformed through specific choices, e.g., "adjacent possibilities" as a stitching method.</comment>
