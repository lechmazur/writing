<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alya's motivation is clear and rooted in her identity as an engineer, compelling her high-stakes choice to redirect the terminal's systems. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in actions like tracing the sextant's scale. The final endurance (leaving the birds to fly) is earned, though her internal contradiction under pressure could be slightly more dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the terminal is reborn into a "quieter circuit," with cost legible in the spinning coin and Alya's pocketing of the sextant as "proof." The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure escalating through the reactivation of systems, culminating in the architect's hologram and the fountain's return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, pressuring choices and supplying resources (e.g., the utility core, glycol runoff). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("rust had landscaped every surface into Martian vermillion"). The terminal itself constrains choice and decisively charges the final image, functioning as a character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Alya's agency under the accumulative lens, with each action (rerouting glycol, welding) tightening the possibility of success. The cost is legible in the reactivation's impermanence ("leaving the brass birds to patrol an empty cathedral"). A single, meaningful deepening is sufficient and expertly executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of hope through reclamation. The final equations and the architect's wisdom ("Measure what returns") reweight prior material without moralizing. The integration of concept (maze of intentions) is organic and profound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is exceptionally distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends engineering precision with poetic wonder ("a mausoleum of intentions"). The lyrical, patterned diction is taught early and pays off at closure, with no head-hopping. The prose is a character in itself.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is masterful, with high information density and rhythmic control. Every sentence advances story or atmosphere ("her torch humming a bass note against the carnival’s distant ghost"). There are zero loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. The final paragraph's cadence is perfectly judged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story is a singular synthesis of engineering and lyricism, feeling both fresh and inevitable. The core concept (maze of intentions) is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, resulting in a fully authentic vision.</comment>
