<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The poet's characterization is deeply embodied and particular, with micro-choices ("tucked the feather inside the empty tin") revealing a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of a finished poem for a state of "sufficient" openness is earned by the prior causality of his morning ritual and the storm's effect on the horizon. The woman's arrival introduces a credible secondary pressure, and their collaboration feels organic, not convenient. A minor deduction for the woman's slightly archetypal entrance, though her chipped tooth and cracked zither quickly ground her.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image of the poem as "a door left ajar" reconfigures the opening premise of seeking wholeness, with the cost of perpetual incompleteness made legible. The pattern of gathering broken things is taught early and pays off at closure. The lens holds perfectly from the accumulation of fragments to the final, unwound spiral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon is not a passive backdrop but an active crucible that pressures choice—the wounded horizon directly motivates the poet's walk. The feather, the tin, the zither, and the sand all function as micro-settings that constrain and enable action, charging the final image. Sensory detail is exquisitely selective and filtered through the poet's perceptual signature ("sea glass clouded to the color of old longing").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by accumulation under the textural lens. The stake (to "tend the horizon with words") deepens from a solitary practice to a collaborative act of weaving "dawns of different hours." The poet's agency is clear in key turns: drawing the spiral, speaking the first line, and mending the zither string. The cost of embracing incompleteness is felt in the final, sufficient but unfinished poem.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of image and action, culminating in the profound, non-literal final line: "Incomplete is the only doorway beauty knows how to use." The concept is earned through the specific struggle with the drake's feather, the broken objects, and the snapped kite string, resisting any tidy moral. The ending offers a resonant reweighting of prior material without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The lyrical, poetic voice is a distinct perceptual signature, consistently maintained and heightened under pressure. The controlled use of figurative language ("Morning is a torn net that still holds fish") is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design. POV is stable and deep, with elision (the woman's backstory) being purposeful and legible. The dialogue, though sparse, is goal-driven and rich with subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor deduction for a slight risk of over-decoration in a few phrases (e.g., "loom of almost"), though the pattern is taught and the clarity of the closure image remains untouched. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph is a masterclass in concision and resonant image-making.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a shoreline poet, a cracked zither, and a philosophy of incompleteness is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, beautiful conclusion. The risk of a highly lyrical, almost plotless structure pays off by heightening the stakes of the thematic question through a singular artistic stance.</comment>
