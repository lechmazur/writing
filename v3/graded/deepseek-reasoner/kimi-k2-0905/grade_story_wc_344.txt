<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rowan's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in emotional wound (mentor's loss), compelling higher-stakes choices. His internal conflict is embodied in the irregular heart-tick metaphor, and his final choice to step into the memory is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The flawed key's repair is a perfect micro-choice revealing his hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds perfectly: Rowan's actions ("uncapped the brass tube," "placed it against the glass") directly lead to revelation and resolution. Closure is a decisive change (DC) with clear cost—the vanished doorway—legible in the final image. The hall's rule (storing better versions) is taught and pays off impeccably at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The frozen library and hall of mirrors are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The mirror's property of storing "better versions" is the central mechanic that enables the climax. Sensory detail is purposefully selective (e.g., "boots squealing on crystal floors") and deeply integrated with POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: his failed gear test leads to the observation of the reflections' flaw, which forces the key-forging choice. The cost is legible in the door locking behind him, foreclosing retreat. The dominant stake (learning repair) tightens meaningfully through this reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme of repair through forgiveness and integration of past flaws emerges organically from the lock-and-key mechanics and the mirrored "drafts." The final image of clocks ticking "inward" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized; the voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled under pressure ("doubt hissed like thawing steel"). The perceptual signature is unique and consistent. Purposeful elision (e.g., the exact prophecy text) is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor deduction for slight momentum drag in the middle from ornate description ("driftwood nostalgia"). However, no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. The final line's rhythm is masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmithing, celestial mechanics, and memory is wholly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept (hall of mirrors storing discarded drafts) is a fresh, non-obvious angle that heightens stakes and coherence. Bold risk-taking in the lyric mode pays off fully.</comment>
