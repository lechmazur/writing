<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's mechanical arm and needle card are embodied extensions of his philosophy, not ornamental. His final shift from rivalry to collaboration is earned through the duel's revelation. Vale's "diplomatically fierce" stillness contrasts Elian's ticking urgency, creating a status dynamic that charges their reunion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the sundial's missing angle logically demands the brook's reflection to complete the code. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the completed sundial chime signals their collaborative inquiry, with cost felt in Elian's relaxed gears and their shared step forward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sundial and brook are not backdrop but active constraints: the coded angles direct the duel's footwork, and the brook's reversal completes the geometric argument. The glass atrium amplifies the shifting light, making the environment a tactical partner in the philosophical contest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from individual victory to collaborative discovery through the foil duel and Vale's secreted note. The brook's reversal is the decisive tightening that redefines their goal, forcing a shared reading of time. Cost is legible in their abandoned entry to the Council.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: inquiry as collaborative door-kicking, not solitary conquest. The needle card transforms from personal relic to shared vessel, and the "hidden overture" becomes a melody they co-author. No moralizing; the answer is in the brook carrying their question forward.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elian's perceptual signature—gears tick, shadows shift philosophically. Dialogue is taut and subtext-rich ("You still sew your arguments?"). The prose rhythm mirrors hydraulic grace and intellectual precision without artifice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with sentences doing double duty (e.g., "boots scraping faint lines into the paint" choreographs movement and symbolic defacement). No loops or scaffold; figurative language ("water glinted like a blade not yet drawn") sharpens peak beats without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Synthesizes philosophy, geometry, and fencing into a fresh, inevitable whole. The mechanical arm and sundial are not quirks but essential to the logic of "stitching time." Risk-taking in quiet climax—resolution via reflected light—heightens stakes through intellectual revelation.</comment>
