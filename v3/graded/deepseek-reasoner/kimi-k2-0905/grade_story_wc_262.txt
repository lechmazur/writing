<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is concrete, rooted in a specific, embodied grief (mother's vanished hum). Her "spatially imaginative mind" is a consistent trait that filters perception and drives the plot. The final choice to rewrite the film is a decisive change earned by her prior actions and the story's logic. Her emotional progression is credible, layering grief, hope, and resolution without diagnostic summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara gains the complete lyrics and internalizes the film strip, reconfiguring her understanding of love with a clear, felt cost (tears, then warmth). Causality is tight; every beat flows from her initial act of psychometry. The final image of the letter lifting into film threading into her chest is the undeniable cost proof.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The projection booth is not just described but is the crucible that constrains and enables the entire plot. Key objects (film strip, crystal sphere, cigarette case) are integral to choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Mara's professional and emotional POV (e.g., "dust floated like slow film frames"). Spatial choreography is flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is a masterful density increase and pattern break. The dominant stake (finding the lyrics/understanding her mother's love) is signaled immediately. Pressure coheres and tightens through the self-threading film and the projector starting, a meaningful turn that narrows options and changes knowledge. The cost is legible in the vision of her mother and the final, physical finding of the letter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the specific events and images ("love unused is not gone; it loops"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the mother's postscript, reweighting all prior material without moralizing. The core concept of "goodbye letters" and "unused love" is fully integrated into the narrative arc and character motive, avoiding abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable, deeply embedded, and distinct. The prose has a rich, lyrical texture with a consistent perceptual signature ("dust floated like slow film frames"). The voice modulates beautifully with emotional intensity, though there is a slight convergence in the climactic description of the film threading into her chest, which leans slightly more toward omniscient certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is purposeful and pattern-taught ("dust like slow film frames," "pigeons that fluttered like white sprocket holes"). There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts. Sentence-level propulsion is perfect, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. The final line is a masterful resonant image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychometry, vintage cinema, and emotional archaeology is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The story commits fully to its singular artistic stance, taking bold risks with its magical realist mechanics that heighten stakes and meaning without becoming a gimmick.</comment>
