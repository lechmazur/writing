<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aurelia's motivation is clear and rooted in her revolutionary past, with interiority shown through embodied emotion ("voice burnished by regret"). Her final choice to crush the shard is earned by prior causality, demonstrating a meaningful change with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, such as her whispered confession contrasting with her serene smile at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (the shard's transformation) with felt cost (Aurelia's dissolution) under a coherent causal lens. The plot is tightly structured with because/therefore linkages: she covers mirrors to protect against the storm, leading to the shard's rebirth. Orientation is immediate, and the ending reconfigures the world with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vividly rendered and actively constrains choices (e.g., mirrored halls amplify the storm, necessitating the covering method). Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Aurelia's POV, such as feeling the "slow pulse of visible time." The environment charges the final image and shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: Aurelia's decision to cover mirrors tightens options and leads to the climax. The dominant stake (reimagining civilization) is signaled early and tested by the storm and archaeologist's arrival. Cost is legible in her dissolution and the transformation of the shard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events (e.g., covered mirrors, the new crystal) rather than direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of failed revolutions and reimagination. Subtext operates in gestures like Aurelia's smile and the archaeologist's changed recorder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature ("ribbons of chronology twisting like silk scarves soaked in blood"). The prose has rhythmic control and poetic density without obscuring clarity. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing without muddling peak beats. No artifacts, loops, or scaffold; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm is compelling and supports emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The concept synthesizes time storms, revolutionary sorrow, and poetic reimagination with fresh specificity. Risks in lyrical density and non-linear time payoff without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight, and the core premise is transformed through grounded, particular details.</comment>
