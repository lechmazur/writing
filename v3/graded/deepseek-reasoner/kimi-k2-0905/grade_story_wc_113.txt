<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("water lapping at his waist," "feeling how the water seemed to part for him"). The final choice to embrace the "between-spaces" is earned by his established liminal existence and the ghost's guidance. A hairline deduction for a slight diagnostic feel in the final realization ("permission to exist in those between-spaces").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, landing with undeniable conceptual cost in the final image of playing the "symphony of the unsung." The pattern of water-damaged images and wordless communication is taught early and pays off. Causality is tight; his descent and discovery are motivated by the ghost's guidance and the program's clues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is indispensable, pressuring every choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("water lapping at his waist," "flickering lantern light," "floating bolts of silk"). The setting constrains and enables the entire narrative, functioning as both environment and central metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, as each new image in the program deepens his understanding and compels him further. The cost is legible in his descent into the dangerous flooded basement and the final, disruptive choice he makes. A minor deduction for the ghost's encouragement slightly easing the pressure of his choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "between-spaces," culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. The final image of playing the music "that existed in the spaces between" reweights all prior material without moralizing. The integration of art, silence, and disruption feels earned and complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filtered through the musician's professional and emotional lens. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture suited to the accumulative mode. A slight deduction for occasional elevated diction ("liminal existence") that, while thematically relevant, slightly strains the immediacy of his perilous situation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly controlled and evocative, with strong rhythmic variation and vivid imagery. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("strange images bloomed where water damage had dissolved the ink"). A minor deduction for a slight template cadence in a few consecutive sentences starting with "The" in the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghost story, a flooded setting, and a meta-narrative about art is fresh and specific. The core concept of "between-spaces" is transformed through grounded, sensory particulars. It feels inevitable in hindsight, though the "betrayed soprano" backstory is a slightly familiar trope that prevents a higher score.</comment>
