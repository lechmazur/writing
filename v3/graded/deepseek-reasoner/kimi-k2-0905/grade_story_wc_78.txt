<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prophet's motivation to "turn obstacles into instruments" is clear, consistent, and drives all key choices. His interiority is concrete and embodied through professional actions (reading clouds, striking objects). A credible endurance/renunciation is earned, foreclosing passive waiting with the visible cost of collective effort. The final choice to "strike absence" is a high-stakes tactic rooted in his established methodology.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (the raft moves) achieved through a resonant reconfiguration (silence becomes rhythm) with clear, felt cost (the crew's collective effort). The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, building patterns of sound and imagery that cohere into a solution. Orientation is immediate and the taught pattern pays off cleanly at the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating orchard setting is indispensable, pressuring choices (no wind) and supplying resources (trees, barrels, buoys) for the sound-based solution. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through the prophet's professional POV. The environment constrains tactics and charges the final image of the raft edging forward across the mirror-like sea.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (overcoming the calm) escalates cleanly under the accumulative lens through a density increase of sound. The prophet's agency drives the escalation, culminating in the tactic of "striking absence." The cost is legible in the crew's mobilized effort and the transformation of a static obstacle into a dynamic instrument.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action and image ("obstacles were only instruments not yet tuned"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting silence into a productive force without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the shift from striking objects to striking absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "clouds moved in slow arpeggios"). The lyrical, professional voice is perfectly controlled and modulated under pressure. Purposeful compression ("fractal generating") is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and never muddled. There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts. Sentence-level propulsion expertly mirrors the building euphony. The final image is crystal clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise—navigating by sound on a floating orchard—is strikingly original and fully committed to. The synthesis of concept, character, and setting feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative mode heightens stakes and coherence without obscuring clarity. A singular artistic stance.</comment>
