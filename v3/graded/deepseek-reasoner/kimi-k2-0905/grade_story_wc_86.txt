<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's interior contradiction (regret vs duty) and embodied emotion ("coat heavy with salt") drive micro-choices like offering gloves. His final renunciation (giving away the drawer pull) is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("heart fuller...pocket lighter").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: pattern of moon-rhythm and object symbolism tightens through cadence shift (rope ritual). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost felt in "forgiveness is not a sound but a space." Orientation is clear by ~100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Parapet and mist actively constrain choices (forbidding metal, erasing horizon). The drawer pull charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("wind carried every clang"). Micro-setting (body-as-setting) functions perfectly through gloves and rope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under accumulative lens: his moon-timing creates a hush, then his questions deepen emotional stakes. Cost is legible in "visible or felt cost scaled to this length" through the rope's vanishing and empty palms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically from recurring images (drawer pull, rope, moon) without statement. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: "recycled mistakes ring like iron." Subtext operates in gesture (returned drawer pull refused) and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("bruised dawn," "squid grief") and rhythmic control under pressure. POV is stable and deep. Dialogue is sparse but potent with subtext ("contrition weighed against a kingdom’s debt"). Elision (moon phases) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High information density with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("mist thicker than any dungeon wall"). Syntax accelerates with pressure ("Thunder prowled..."). No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of negotiation tropes through specific symbolism (moon rhythm, drawer pull). Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes. Transformation feels inevitable: the parapet's expanded feeling arises from prior particulars.</comment>
