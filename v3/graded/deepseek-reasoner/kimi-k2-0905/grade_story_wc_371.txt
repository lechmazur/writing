<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mila's characterization is exceptionally specific and embodied, from her professional "gift" to her gentle handling of the bread. Her internal contradiction—fearing the bread's consumption while acting to preserve memory—drives the plot. Her final shift to a cultivator, with "soil under nails now hers," is a decisive, earned change rooted in prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure building through the pattern of vanishing and planting. Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the sacred is revealed as "continuous," reweighting the entire premise. The cost of this tenuous, ongoing labor is felt in the final image of her walking into the "widening morning."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is masterfully integrated and constrains choice. The "flour ghosts" in the bakery and the secret tea house's "soil under every fingernail" are vivid, purposeful details. The overgrown palace courtyard itself is the crucible that enables the method and charges the final image of "ruins that refuse to forget."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (city's amnesia) and escalate through the accumulative act of planting, which deepens the knowledge of what's at risk. The protagonist's agency—choosing to plant instead of eat—narrows options and forces a trade-off, culminating in the tangible cost of her ongoing vigil as a noticer/gardener.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of finding the sacred in the ordinary is earned entirely through concrete action and image, never stated. The final realization—"the sacred had not returned but revealed itself as continuous"—is a profound, non-literal answer that reweights every prior beat without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, perceptive quality that filters the world through Mila's specific profession and sensibility. Phrases like "creeping normality" and "heuristically gentle" become part of the story's idiom. POV is stable and deeply embedded in her consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Every sentence advances multiple layers of story, character, and atmosphere. Figurative language ("bread is daily resurrection") is precise and powerful. Rhythm is controlled and varies effectively with the emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of magical realism, ecological activism, and personal vocation feels entirely fresh and organic. The core concept of "guerrilla gardening" with memory-laden bread is a breathtakingly original and specific vehicle for the theme. The story commits fully to its premise and follows its implications with bold integrity.</comment>
