<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The reaper's heartbreak and quest for meaning are concretely embodied through micro-choices (tracing the tentacle, shattering the cylinders). His final renunciation—folding the ledger into souls—is earned by the memory of the plague girl, a moment of profound internal contradiction that charges the closure with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Decisive Change (DC) under a Causal lens: the reaper's understanding of his own nature is fundamentally altered, foreclosing his former path of passive harvesting. The cost is legible in the final image of the warm streak on his cheekbone and the crumbling observatory, proving a felt price has been paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The observatory is not a backdrop but a crucible; the dome, copper pool, and atlas page actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and purposeful, filtered through the reaper's professional and emotional priorities (e.g., "boots grinding quartz dust," "starlight dripped").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the reaper's agency under the Causal lens: his interaction with the atlas triggers the star-sentences, which lead to the pivotal question and memory. The cost is unmistakable in the revelation that "every soul he reaped had paid some fraction of their death to postpone his own," a profound tightening that narrows his options to a single, costly act of release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of sacrifice emerges organically from the specific, charged particulars (the wax cylinders, the sketched krakens, the brother's reflected gaze) rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the image of rising paper souls, reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature ("constellations crawled across the dome like silver lice"). The voice's elevated, mythic register is perfectly motivated by the character and concept. There is no head-hopping, and the lyrical compression serves the closure effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though the phrase "like silver lice" risks a slightly mixed register. This minor artifact does not harm closure clarity, and the propulsion to the final image is flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of reaper mythology, cartography, and acoustics (wax cylinders) is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept—that a reaper is sustained by the sacrifices intended for others—is a non-obvious, ingenious inversion that fully commits to its implications, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
