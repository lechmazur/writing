<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Characterization is concrete and particular, with strong embodied emotion ("felt turbines bud in her marrow"). The final endurance is earned by prior causality, though the climax's summary of multiple miners' memories slightly abstracts the peak internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands on the page with felt cost ("blood threading from her hairline"). The accumulative lens holds, tightening through density and a cadence shift. The final image reweights options with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice (the cliff's edge) and charging the final image (new quartz seams). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action, with the canyon itself functioning as a key pressure source and resonant object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a clear, meaningful tightening as the moon shifts. Cost is legible in the collapse and physical injury. The dominant stake (extracting dreams) is tested and reweighted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of abandoned dreams. The final sketches and resolve to return provide a conceptual repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature. The prose is purposefully dense and patterned, though the syntactic complexity in high-pressure beats (e.g., the memory influx) creates minor opacity without breaking clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and rhythmic, with excellent information economy. Minor figurative overload occurs in the peak memory beat ("Suddenly she was every miner..."), slightly muddying clarity, but the closure image remains sharp and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of quantum entanglement, memory, and engineering is fresh and non-obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in prose style and concept heightens stakes without gimmickry, fully committed to its premise.</comment>
