<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Luma's motivation is clear and compelling, driving every action. Her internal state is conveyed through concrete, embodied perception (e.g., "feeling the tiles click like teeth"). The final choice to launch the rocket is earned by prior causality, though Jax feels more functional than fully dimensional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive, resonant reconfiguration (RR) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The cost is legible on-page as the governor's worldview is shattered and the hourglass changes. Causality is tight, with the rag knot fuse and silver dust lullaby paying off established setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in purposeful, POV-filtered detail. The "blooming fortress" and its "stone petals" are not just decorative but actively constrain and enable Luma's climb. The environment consistently pressures choices and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Luma's agency under the Accumulative lens, building textural density toward the climax. The dominant stake (hope vs. despair) is tested in her confrontation with the governor. The cost of her gamble is felt in the suspended moment before the rocket's success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between hope and enforced order. The final image of the "mosaic heart" spelling "Remember" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing. The concept of "serious playfulness" is fully integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and consistently controlled, with a lyrical, percussive rhythm that mirrors Luma's chants. POV is stable and deeply filtered through her professional, poetic perception. The prose's density is purposeful and never obscures clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly inventive, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail. A minor deduction for occasional risk of overwriting (e.g., "corked, as though some great hand had stoppered the heavens"), but the density serves the accumulative mode and never stalls momentum or obscures closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a fireworks designer, a mosaic note, and a corked sky feels fresh, inevitable, and highly original. The concept is committed to fully, and the specific, lived-in details (kerosene rag, silver dust) ground the magical realism with authenticity.</comment>
