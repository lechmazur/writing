<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mirela’s internal contradiction (smuggler/archivist) is dramatized in scene, and her final choice to vanish is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Her embodied emotions ("tasting iron") and micro-choices under pressure reveal a clear hierarchy of values. The final renunciation forecloses a path with a felt, conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mirela vanishes, leaving only an echo; cost is legible in the micro-etched lullaby under the floorboard. The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly as pattern density increases and reweights the stake of remembrance. The persistent constraint of her past shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The attic setting and dust motes actively constrain choice and charge the final image, teaching Mirela to balance. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through her POV. The environment is a micro-setting that pressures choices and supplies resources (the meteorite hollow, atlases) that affect the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, moving from personal hiding to preserving songs for others. The cost is unmistakable in her final disappearance. Pressure coheres and tightens through a meaningful cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake from survival to legacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how identity and song survive, reweighting prior material without a stated moral. Theme emerges organically from events and images (dust motes, meteorite). The final image of children humming the tune is a profound conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and exquisite rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistently lyrical and character-specific, with purposeful elision (her smuggling past) that is paid off. POV is stable and apt, with free indirect style cleanly deployed. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exquisite prose with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure ("silent ballet"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm is masterful and varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of pigeon trainer, meteorite, and lost songs feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination is organic and singular, not a checklist, offering a fresh angle on familiar material.</comment>
