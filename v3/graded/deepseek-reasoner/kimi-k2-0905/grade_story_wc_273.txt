<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kael's serene anger and determination are embodied through concrete micro-choices, like tracing the bootprint and emptying the ink vial. His final acceptance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his disappearance. Lyra's wildness is shown through her stride and journal, not told. Minor deduction for slightly diagnostic language in "serene anger," though it's quickly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strong with because/therefore linkages from bootprint to ink to portal. Closure is a decisive change (stepping into the portal) with felt cost—vanishing. Orientation is immediate; the wind-carved encampment and eclipse timeframe anchor the scene by ~100 words. The portal reveal reconfigures options cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the finale: sandstone holds ink patterns, wind carves corridors, and the portal emerges from the environment. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "warm from the vanished sun"). The encampment functions as a crucible, pressuring Kael's search.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal loss to cosmic revelation through Kael's agency—using the drone, interpreting symbols, choosing to follow. Cost is legible in the dissolution of the drone and Kael's vanishing. Pressure tightens with each clue (bootprint, journal, portal), culminating in a decisive choice under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through Lyra's journal and the portal reveal—time as a protective, expandable fabric. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like the melting hourglass and fractal ink. No thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Kael's perception. Voice is distinct and lyrical ("serene anger," "consciously wild") without register drift. The hummingbird drone's consciousness is handled with consistent poetic precision. No head-hopping or exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density. Minor deduction for slight metaphorical density in peak beats (e.g., "time was not linear but folded like origami"), but clarity is maintained. Rhythm supports urgency, and there are no loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of desert tracking, temporal anomalies, and ink-based magic feels fresh and inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific details (e.g., artificial hummingbird drone, disappearing ink). Risk-taking in lyrical abstraction pays off at closure.</comment>
