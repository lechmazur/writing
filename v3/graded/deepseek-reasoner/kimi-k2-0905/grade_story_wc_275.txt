<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is exceptionally embodied, with her contradictory inheritance (perceptive eyes vs. pacifist path) driving a micro-choice—grafting the violent canvas—that earns the final Charged Poise. Her emotional state is rendered through specific, sensory perception (e.g., feeling tremors, noting rose colors) rather than diagnostic labels. The final endurance/renunciation is fully motivated by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands with undeniable cost in the final image of the "faint pulse of roots." The pattern of weaving violent and peaceful threads is taught early and pays off. Orientation is immediate and purposeful; the drive lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cracked glass dome and desert rose farm are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The setting is a crucible: the roses bloom brighter where blood soaked the earth, and the dome's "engraved quiet" pressures Mira's work. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her specific priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a decisive cadence shift: the act of sheathing the thorny stem in the canvas scrap reweights the dominant stake of continuity/transformation with a visible cost (the physical and symbolic binding). This single meaningful deepening is driven by protagonist agency and is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of grafting and weaving, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of continuity. The final image of the hybrid rose with copper petals and canvas-weave stems is a profound thematic synthesis without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature ("senselessly perceptive eyes") that filters every detail. The lyrical, measured prose rhythm is perfectly suited to the accumulative, reflective mode and modulates intentionally with the tranquil tone. There is no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally controlled, with high information density and zero artifacts, loops, or scaffold. Figurative language ("tranquil blaze," "engraved quiet") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the contemplative mood. The final line is a masterful image that recharges prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of bounty hunting and pacifist horticulture is a fresh, non-obvious angle that feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of "inculcating plants with values" is transformed from a potential gimmick into a coherent philosophy through specific, grounded choices. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
