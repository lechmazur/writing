<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mireya's motivation crystallizes cleanly from observation to determined action, with micro-choices (prodding the leaf, building the first monument) revealing her values. Her transformation is earned and embodied, culminating in a final choice (releasing the moonstone) that forecloses a path with visible cost. The only minor deduction is for a slight diagnostic feel in "mossy delight unfurling like fern fronds," which borders on therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing: the sky accepting the offerings reconfigures the premise from a problem to a dialogue. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure building through the density of monuments and the leaves' accelerating messages. Cost is legible in the final image of the verdant arbor above, a direct result of Mireya's agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is not just a vivid backdrop but a crucial actor, its upward-falling leaves inciting the core conflict. The moonstone cabochon dust speck constrains and enables Mireya's choices, charging the final image when it bursts. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and filtered through her professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mireya's agency under the Accumulative lens, from decoding a single leaf to building a collective movement. The cost is unmistakable as the moonstone grows warmer and her perception alters, culminating in the tangible trade-off of releasing it. The stakes transform from personal curiosity to a cosmic exchange.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central action of building monuments, culminating in the resonant, non-literal answer of the mirrored arbors. The piece resists moralizing, offering profound ambiguity about what deserves to be remembered. The adjusted folklore at the end feels earned, not stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, precise perceptual signature that remains stable under pressure. The prose is purposefully compressed and patterned, taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift; the POV is firmly anchored in Mireya's consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some high-pressure beats (e.g., "soft thunder," "mossy delight unfurling"), which, while beautiful, occasionally risks slight clarity. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>A stunningly original synthesis of fantasy and thematic depth. The core premise of leaves rising with forgotten messages is fresh and non-obvious, transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight, a hallmark of high ingenuity.</comment>
