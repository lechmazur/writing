<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear, rooted in a specific, poetic worldview. Her internal conflict is embodied in the confrontation with her echo, and her final choice to release the petals is a decisive, earned renunciation with visible cost. The "driftingly alert" trait permeates her perception and actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the courtyard becomes an instrument and the ghost settles; cost is legible in the transformation of the petals and the empty, sigh-light bolt plate. The echo's appearance is a meaningful, causally-linked complication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional, purposeful sensory detail. The setting is not just atmospheric but actively pressures the action—the mist leans closer, the stones warm, the storm's imminent arrival dictates the pace. The flower press bolt plate is a perfect example of a micro-setting object that constrains choice and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a flawless density increase. The stake (articulating need before the storm erases it) tightens with the echo's accusation, culminating in the release of the moths and the final glyph. The cost of Lyra's agency is the dissolution of her collected needs and the echo of herself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core action: that articulating need is an act of release into communal static, not solitary preservation. The final image of the open mouth/listening ear glyph is a profound, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting all prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, controlled, and perfectly calibrated to the Accumulative mode. The poetic compression is taught from the first line and paid off at closure. The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lyra's unique perception, with a distinct perceptual signature ("the static that lived between lightning and thunder").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and avoids muddle. There is no scaffold or loop; rhythm is masterfully controlled to accelerate with the storm's approach.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>A singularly original synthesis of concept, character, and method. The combination of a balladeer, a flower press used as a shield and pigment source, and storm-graffiti is highly inventive and feels inevitable. The core concept of a "ghost in code" is transformed into a specific, emotionally resonant mechanism.</comment>
