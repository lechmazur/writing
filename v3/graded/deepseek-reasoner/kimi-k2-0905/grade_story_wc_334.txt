<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with "gloved fingers trembling" under pressure. Her "chronically curious" trait drives every action, culminating in an earned renunciation of forgetting that carries visible cost. The final choice to reclaim memories feels inevitable based on prior causality, with no diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly from investigation to closure. Orientation is immediate with concrete anchors. Closure is a decisive change (reclaiming memories) with felt cost—the pain of loss now borne willingly. The fungal ring and sextant create a persistent constraint that shapes the entire tactical approach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the sunken orchard greenhouse and fungal ring actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details ("cider and rust," "salt-crystal leaves") are filtered through Mara's expertise. The environment dictates movement and tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by Mara's agency under causal lens—detecting bruises, choosing to slice the mushroom. Cost is legible when she accepts pain to keep memories. Stakes transform from abstract recovery to concrete reclamation ("pear butter on burnt toast").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory/habit emerges organically through specific images (sextant shards, raincoat) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "curiosity is just memory trying to find its way home." Subtext operates powerfully in the mushroom's pulsing urge versus her deliberate cut.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature ("ship ribs arched overhead like the bones of whales"). Voice remains consistent under pressure, though minor register elevation ("crisp nostalgia") occurs. No head-hopping; all elision is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with high information density. Minor figurative strain in "crisp nostalgia" slightly muddles sensory clarity, but does not harm closure. Rhythm controls tension effectively ("The greenhouse shuddered"). No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptionally original synthesis of folklore, memory, and cosmic imagery. The fungal ring as memory vault feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with inverted peach trees and celestial bruises heightens stakes without gimmickry. Premise is fully committed and transformed through lived detail.</comment>
