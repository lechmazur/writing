<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's claustrophobia is viscerally embodied and her motivation to "stand by the unremembered" is dramatized through high-stakes choices. Her micro-choice to speak each name anchors the technicians, revealing a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with the felt cost of a new obligation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Mara's act of remembrance returns the technicians, foreclosing her anonymity with the cost of a wider obligation. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory density and pattern (gold fleck, phase transitions) to a decisive cadence shift. Cost is legible in the final image: "the wider fear—and obligation—of remembering." Orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a crucible that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. The facility's "throat of stone" constrains movement, and the gold fleck's phase-shifting mechanics rewrite local physics, directly enabling Mara's agency. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through professional and emotional priorities (e.g., "rustled bulkhead," "pulsed with the crash of surf"). The cable vault and conduits are integral to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with each spoken name intensifying the stakes and thinning the gold fleck. The dominant stake (bearing witness) deepens through a series of concretely felt costs, culminating in the return initiation. Pressure coheres and tightens through a meaningful cadence shift that reweights the final obligation with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from event and image, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: "to stand by the unremembered is not to anchor them in sorrow but to return them... to the breathing world." The gold fleck and cable tracks are particulars that accrue meaning without allegorical shouting. The ending avoids moralizing, offering complexity through the cost of memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature that filters the world through Mara's claustrophobia and professional focus. The lyrical, dense prose is voice-motivated and pattern-taught, with elision (phase transitions) paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating in cramped passages and breathing in resolution. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits exceptional density and rhythmic control, with every sentence advancing story or atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("a crashing hush," "auroral scars"), never muddying clarity. There are no loops, scaffold, or artifacts; syntax and diction vary naturally to support the accumulative build. The final line lands with resonant precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of claustrophobic spelunking, undersea cables, and supernatural signal mechanics feels fresh and inevitable. The phase transition concept is fully committed to, following its implications without retreat. Risk-taking in lyrical density and accumulative structure heightens stakes and coherence, resulting in a singular artistic stance far beyond template plotting.</comment>
