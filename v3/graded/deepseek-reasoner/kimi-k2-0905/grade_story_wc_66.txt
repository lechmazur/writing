<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mila's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her profession and rebellion. Her micro-choices, like scraping rosin and weaving copper, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final choice to transmit is earned by prior causality, and her internal contradiction—meticulous copyist versus daring rebel—is shown in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The accumulative lens holds, building pattern and pressure through repeated broadcasts and Mila's preparations. Closure is a decisive Conceptual Repricing where dust becomes a narrative medium, with cost legible as inspectors stagger, "eyes reflecting paragraphs they had burned." Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The ember alcove and shortwave dial's glow function as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("mist tasting of iron"), fully integrated into action and filtered through Mila's professional bias. The environment actively shapes the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (story famine) and escalate through Mila's increasingly risky actions, driven by her agency under the accumulative lens. The cost is unmistakable on the page in the climax, as sound becomes a weapon and the Ministry men are transformed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the potent central metaphor of music as smuggled narrative. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the image of whispering dust, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Mila's profession. The lyrical, compressed prose is pattern-taught and perfectly serves the accumulative design. Diction and syntax remain consistent and voice-motivated under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and avoids muddle. There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. Rhythm and syntax expertly modulate to support the story's accumulating pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The core premise of encoding stories into musical intervals is brilliantly original and fully committed to. The synthesis of elements feels inevitable and is executed with high conceptual integrity. The risk-taking in style and structure heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
