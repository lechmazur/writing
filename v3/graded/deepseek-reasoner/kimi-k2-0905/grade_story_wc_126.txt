<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply specific and embodied, particularly her acoustic perception ("drip of condensation... a minor seventh") and the micro-choice to plant the seed. Her motivation to "unbind" the bowl's fate is rooted in familial tradition and personal grief, compelling higher-stakes choices. The final endurance—leaving the bowl humming—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the relinquishment of completion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building pressure through sensory density and pattern breaks (the seed splitting, the wire bridge). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost: the "seedling’s first leaf unfurled, green as a new question" reconfigures the premise of beauty in the unfinished, making the conceptual cost legible. The pattern is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse setting is indispensable, constraining choice (the broken pane, the wet soil) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and purposeful ("ash-slick mud," "charned mango pits"), filtered through Mara's acoustic perception. The environment evolves causally, becoming a resonant character itself.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens: her decision to build a wire bridge is a meaningful tightening that reweights the stake. The cost is legible in the "seed split" and the relinquishment of the bowl. Pressure coheres and deepens through density increases, not causal turns, perfectly suiting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept and specific images ("beauty in the unfinished is not abandonment but invitation"). The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence, particularly the "chronic hush" that answers Mara's playing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in sound. The prose has a controlled, lyrical rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful elision (unfinished phrases) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor deduction for a slight rhythm flattening in the final paragraph ("no bonfire, no crowd..."). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The closure image remains crystal clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of post-apocalyptic lyricism and musical metaphor. The core concept ("chronic hush") is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
