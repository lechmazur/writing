<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., kneeling to place the nest) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (leaving lighter) is earned by prior causality, with the cost of releasing the past made legible. The ghostwriter's professional flaw (forging hearts leaving her own unaddressed) complicates choices and drives the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) landing on-page with cost ("lighter by the exact weight of one thrush’s nest"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory and symbolic density. The persistent constraint of her ghostwriting past shapes the final image and tactics. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The lotus temple and lily pond are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image—the pontoon bridge releases chimes with each step, and the pond "tilted its mirror to the sky" at closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the protagonist's perception (e.g., "air smelled of wet marble and incense burned long ago").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens—her choice to place the nest triggers the weaving of memory and light, a meaningful deepening that reweights the stake of emotional reconnection. The cost is unmistakable in the crumbled nest and her lighter departure. Pressure coheres and tightens through this single, decisive act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of connection through storytelling emerges organically from events and images, culminating in the non-literal, resonant realization that "the thread that connects all things is not love itself but the telling of it." The ending offers a profound answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the final exchange of "I am here" and "We know."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature ("a prismatic quiet," "colored light"). The lyrical, compressed prose is pattern-taught and legible, modulating with emotional intensity without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping; the voice remains coherent and specific under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "each footfall released a faint chime, as if the temple itself inhaled her hesitation"). Zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity. The closure image is sharp and unblemished by artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghostwriter, a mystical temple, and a public art installation feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded particulars, and the final reconfiguration is earned from established patterns.</comment>
