<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her desire to safeguard innovation, compelling high-stakes choices under pressure. Her embodied emotion ("pulse matched the distant approaching storm") and micro-choices (redirecting growth with levers) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to embrace mutation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the altered mill and reversed brook. A hairline slip: her receptivity feels slightly diagnostic but is quickly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost: the mill now breathes and mutates, foreclosing stasis. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory density and pattern breaks (brook reversal, gear clicks). Causality is tight: the seed's planting directly triggers the architectural rewrite. The final image of the empty envelope reweights the premise, proving the cycle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (soil only under final chamber) and charging the final image (brook flowing backward). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("cold air exhaled from the cavity, carrying whispers"). The mill's architecture acts as a crucible, evolving with the seed's growth to redefine options. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite surreal shifts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens: her decision to plant the seed and later guide the growth tightens options, forcing her to innovate within the transforming labyrinth. The cost is legible in the mill's permanent alteration and the whispered echoes of past players. The dominant stake (sanctuary preservation) deepens through a cadence shift from threat to symbiotic cycle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the corpse flower's transformation from threat to source of wonder, answering the central question of innovation's cost without moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal resolution: the empty envelope signifies the haven now writing its own riddles. Subtext operates in the reversed brook and phosphorescent seeds, implying a cycle of renewal orthogonal to time.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that filters setting through Mira's professional bias ("orthogonal angles of her architecture"). Diction is controlled and purposeful, modulating with pressure ("gears that clicked like anxious teeth"). Elision is taught and paid off: the fugue state is mentioned but not over-explained, serving closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("silence settle over the village like damp wool"). A minor artifact: "notably receptive" slightly echoes prompt language but is quickly embodied. No loops or scaffold; sentence-level craft supports the accumulative pressure without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of escape room and magical botany feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry. The corpse flower seed transforms from a generic threat into a mechanism for architectural mutation, deeply integrated with character and theme. Specific, verifiable detail (waterwheel clicking backward) grounds the surreal premise. The concept commits fully to its implications.</comment>
