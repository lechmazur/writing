<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mourning jeweler's motivation is clear, rooted in profound grief, and her final choice to leave is earned by her on-page actions. Her embodied emotion is specific and avoids diagnostic language, particularly in the tactile handling of the tattoo stencil. The final renunciation is a decisive change with visible cost, moving from preservation to celebration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Decisive Change (leaving) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, charged by the constellation of origami figures. The cost is legible in the final line: "carrying loss not as a burden but as the material." The observatory's disorientation is taught early and pays off, waiving the orientation penalty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory is a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables the protagonist's final action, charging the closure. Sensory details are purposefully selective and filtered through her POV, such as the "fabric woven from the unfinished dreams." The observatory's mechanisms pressure her choice to leave.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, building through the deliberate placement of each origami figure. The dominant stake (moving from grief to acceptance) tightens meaningfully, and the cost of her transformation is felt, though the pressure is more contemplative than actively antagonistic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of transformative grief is fully integrated, emerging from concrete particulars like the "genuinely artificial" jewelry. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The concept is profound and avoids sentimentality through specific, earned imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and possesses a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the emotional intensity of the climax. There is no head-hopping, and the controlled elision of the outside world is purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for figurative density in the final third ("constellation of paper stars," "fabric absorbing the essence") which, while beautiful, slightly risks obscuring the causal clarity of the closure beat under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core concept is strikingly original and fully committed to, synthesizing mourning jewelry, a metaphysical observatory, and origami into a singular, inevitable vision. The premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail and emotional truth, taking a bold risk that pays off at closure.</comment>
