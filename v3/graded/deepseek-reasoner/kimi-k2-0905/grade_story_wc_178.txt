<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Naram-bel's frugality and devotion are embodied through concrete actions (bartering barley, risking discovery). His final choice to become "the silence between regimes" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his disappearance. Emotional complexity is shown through contradictory impulses—fear of empirical irony versus longing for transcendence—acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pressure building through density of image and pattern. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Naram-bel's devotion becomes a permanent, watchful silence, with cost legible in his physical absence and the herald's discovery. The final image reweights the entire premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The palace setting is a crucible that pressures choice (the abandoned scriptorium, the forbidden door). The magic square tile constrains action and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the astronomer's professional perception ("dust floated like pale constellations," "glazed bricks murmuring equations").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (sealing a covenant before the new regime erases the old). Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: each act of drawing and tracing deepens the mystery and narrows options, culminating in the irreversible choice to swear the covenant. The cost of renunciation is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between empirical inquiry and transcendent faith, mathematics and ritual. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: devotion is encrypted into the palace's very structure, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The final image of "dust that refused to settle" is a perfect conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature ("time tasted of copper and ash"). The voice is lush yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity without losing coherence. Purposeful compression ("Stone sighed; mechanisms older than language slid apart") serves the accumulative density and closure effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, never muddying clarity. There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. Every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot, with peak beats ("The lattice rotated, revealing a hidden facet") achieving crystalline clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of ancient Babylonian astronomy with mathematical mysticism feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "encrypted devotion" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
