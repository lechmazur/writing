<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marek's characterization is deeply embodied and contradictory, with his "fierce repose" under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. His final choice to right the king is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the village's inhalation and time snapping forward. The guilt-to-forgiveness arc feels organic and specific, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: time snapping forward after Marek's gesture. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pattern recognition (tapestry, labyrinth) driving the reweighting. The final image of the king in his pocket reconfigures meaning without mechanical resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are purposefully selective ("steel-blue glow," "cobwebs stirred"), filtered through Marek's perception. The platinum labyrinth and tapestry are integrated into action, evolving in meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marek's agency in decoding the tapestry and walking the maze, under the accumulative lens. The stakes (forgiveness) intensify through pattern breaks, culminating in a decisive gesture with cost (time resuming). The pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the chess metaphor and Marek's arc, avoiding moralizing. The final image of the "board wider than the mistake" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to guilt and forgiveness. Subtext operates in implication, such as the king smiling in checkmate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature ("fidgets productively," "fierce repose"). The prose has rhythmic control and purposeful compression, with elision (tapestry decoding) taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though slightly over-written in peaks ("thunder to roll across the board"). Minor figurative stacking occurs but doesn't obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding; sentence-level propulsion is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess, time-freeze, and guilt is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
