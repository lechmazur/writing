<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cael's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with his historically reverent nature and connection to his grandmother driving his every action. His final choice—to become the echo—is earned by prior causality and the felt cost of centuries of longing settling into his weathered face. The single moment of near-diagnostic language ("realizing he'd never truly left") is minor and does not touch the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is clearly taught and held, with pressure building through layered sensory and conceptual density. The closure is a flawless Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Cael's stillness becomes a form of travel, with the cost legible in the final image of his spirit learning an ancient art. The pulse finding its source is the decisive conceptual repricing that ends the wandering.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The setting is the story's crucible. The bone towers and canyon of endless echoes are not just described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image, forcing Cael to navigate without moving. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and purposeful, filtered entirely through his perception, making the environment a character in its own right.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a perfect cadence shift and density increase that reweights the dominant stake of finding home. The pressure coheres and tightens through Cael's song, culminating in the flock's formation becoming a "living arrow." The cost is the visible trade-off of his individual self as he merges with the canyon's voice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment>The theme of home being found through stillness and memory emerges entirely through concrete events and images, not statement. The final image of the boy who learned to navigate by standing still offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The stone arrowhead and bird patterns are particulars that synthesize into a profound, inevitable wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply immersed in Cael's perceptual signature, with a distinct, lyrical texture in word choice and rhythm that modulates beautifully with emotional intensity. The purposeful elision of standard dialogue is a strength, as the story's voice is entirely internal and harmonic, taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and controlled, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion. A minor instance of potential register drift ("navigate without moving" feeling slightly conceptual) is offset by its concrete payoff. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in the peak beats, though the density of figurative language is high throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a harmonic stone skimmer, bone towers, and a pulse left wandering is a singular, non-obvious, and fully realized artistic vision. The core concept feels organic and inevitable, not a checklist, and the story commits to its implications without retreat. The risk-taking in its accumulative, nearly dialogue-free structure heightens stakes and meaning.</comment>
