<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mirage painter's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, compelling high-stakes choices. Her final sacrifice of the heartbeat is earned by prior causality, with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The only minor deduction is for a slight diagnostic awareness in "though her own pulse bucked," but it is immediately embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost, the inferred Accumulative lens holds perfectly. The pattern of three mirrors teaches escalation, culminating in a final image that reweights the premise. The persistent constraint of the borrowed heartbeat shapes the final, costly tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prism parapet, the mirrors, and the heartbeat all function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through the painter's POV. The environment is integral to action, with the terrace and bells applying tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with each mirror presenting a deeper test. The cost of the final choice is unmistakable on the page. The dominant stake (persuading mirrors) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully, though the third mirror's refusal feels slightly declarative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of possibility versus flat truth emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of citizens receiving spectra of selves. Subtext operates powerfully in the lullaby's translation and the mirror's judgments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and exquisite rhythmic control. The voice is consistently poetic yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity. The lullaby's coded language is a brilliant, taught pattern that pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, serving the Accumulative drive. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, with varied syntax and rhythm. A single minor paraphrase loop ("over the hush before bells ring") appears twice but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of fantasy and metaphysical inquiry. The combination of mirage painting, borrowed heartbeats, and prophetic mirrors feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
