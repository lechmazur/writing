<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, from personal longing to communal purpose. Her embodied emotions ("knees ached on the slick stone") and micro-choices (spreading the cloth, whispering the constellation) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation (dissolving the pearl) is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the "sigh released after long crying."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building density through sensory patterns and memory until the final resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with undeniable cost: the pearl dissolves with the "heft of a sigh," and the sea glass becomes "matte and ordinary." The serpentine wall's transformation into a mirror is a decisive, earned image that reweights the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The grotto is not just described but actively pressures Lira's choices and charges the final image. The "serpentine spine" answers with a "low hum," and the "drip of ancient seawater" strikes the shard precisely, constraining the action. Sensory details are exquisitely selective and purposeful, filtered through Lira's perception ("salt-sweet breath of tides").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, with each ritual action intensifying the stakes. The cost is unmistakable: the "weight settle[s] inside her chest, the exact mass of every night she had spent alone." The final release of light without fire is a direct result of her choices, foreclosing her personal possession of the pearl for a communal good.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between fear and quiet light, resolved through a resonant, non-literal image: "a lantern needing no wick." The final paragraphs reweight the premise without moralizing, offering a profound answer to sharing light without burning. Subtext operates powerfully in the pearl's dissolution as "fullness."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature ("calcite veins pulse like faint heartbeats"). The lyrical, precise prose modulates perfectly with emotional intensity, achieving rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; the voice remains consistently filtered through Lira's consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without obscuring clarity. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("zephyr bloom cool"). Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of stargazing, ritual, and quiet magic feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of light without fire is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The story commits fully to its lyrical premise, with bold risk-taking in its accumulative structure that heightens meaning.</comment>
