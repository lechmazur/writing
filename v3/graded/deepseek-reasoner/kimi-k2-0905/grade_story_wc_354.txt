<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tutor's characterization is masterfully embodied through the worry stone and his precise, analytical mind. His internal conflict—exile versus purpose—is dramatized through his correlation of silence into strategy, and his final choice to teach the world is earned by his prior causality and visible cost of exile. The hopeful melancholy of his final stance is a credible, complex emotional state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the tutor's understanding of his exile shifts from an ending to a transposition, reconfiguring his options with the cost of his past loss felt on the page. The nexus's electromagnetic whispers provide a because/therefore linkage that narrows his options to a single, urgent act, perfectly suiting the story's length and scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is not merely described but actively pressures the protagonist's choice and perception, constraining his actions by aligning with the iron in his blood. The twilight sky and crystallizing air are filtered through his chess-centric worldview, charging the final image. The worry stone functions as a micro-setting, its physical erosion mirroring his internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the causal lens, pressure escalates through the nexus's hums, which the protagonist translates, narrowing his options to a single decisive act. The dominant stake (finding meaning in exile) tightens through this agency, and the cost of his past sacrifice (losing his career) is legible and charges his final decision to teach the world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of discovering beauty in difficulty is fully integrated, emerging from the concrete particulars of chess strategy and political sacrifice rather than stated directly. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting his exile as a new beginning. The eclipsed covenant and worry stone are motifs that constrain choice and charge the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply characterized by a chess tutor's analytical, precise perception, translating electromagnetic energy into algebraic notation. The prose has a distinct, controlled rhythm and lexicon that reflects his disciplined mind. There is no head-hopping, and the voice remains coherent and specific under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with vivid, purposeful imagery and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for occasional ornate phrasing (e.g., "exquisite beauty in its most difficult position") that slightly leans toward declarative theme statement in the final beats, though it remains character-consistent. Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and dense with information, advancing story and character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess, political intrigue, and electromagnetic mysticism is fresh and organic, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to, and the risk of a quiet, internal climax heightens stakes through thematic resonance rather than surface action. The specific perspective of the tutor is memorable and singular.</comment>
