<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Myrrh's ambition and olfactory sensitivity drive concrete choices under pressure, culminating in an earned shift to gratitude. Her micro-choices (testing the seed, journalizing, stitching) are specific and reveal a clear hierarchy of values. The final endurance is rooted in prior causality, with the cost of her ambition loosening felt in the graft's success.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through sensory density and pattern (seed, tide, custom) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure image of the "quiet heart" reconfigures the opening ambition with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate and purposeful, teaching the story's lyrical pattern from the first line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The treetop village is not just described but actively pressures Myrrh's climb and choice of graft-site. The environment (rope bridge, platform, bark scars) constrains her actions and charges the final image. Sensory detail is exquisitely selective and filtered through her professional priorities, with the olfactory motif dominating perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Myrrh's agency under the accumulative lens, as her careful progress toward the graft-site deepens the thematic stakes. The cost of her ambition is legible in the precise, risky act of stitching the seed and the subsequent shift to gratitude. The dominant stake (successful graft) is tested and reweighted by the village's "holding still."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of "serenity within motion" emerges organically through the graft ritual, the mother's custom, and the final image, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the transformation of the seed into a "quiet heart," reweighting prior ambition without moralizing. The concept is fully integrated into the narrative's particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by olfaction. The lyrical, compressed syntax is voice-motivated and serves the accumulative design, heightening pressure without obscuring clarity. Purposeful elision (e.g., "mere suggestion") is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control that accelerates and breathes with the scene's needs. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, avoiding muddle. There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a treetop village, olfactory sensitivity, and a corpse flower graft feels fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative mode heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry. The core concept is transformed through grounded, lived detail rather than being a template.</comment>
