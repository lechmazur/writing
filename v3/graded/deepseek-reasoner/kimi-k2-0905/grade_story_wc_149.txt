<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ghost bride's "lovingly venomous" motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions. The boy’s transformation from fear to "mourful elation" is earned through the bead's pressure, culminating in a micro-choice to accept the fruit that forecloses his old life with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds; the seven visitations form a taught pattern of escalating pressure. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the debt is repaid not through blood but transformation, with cost legible in the "withered" orchard and the "seed warm against his lifeline."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse is a crucible that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The "pomegranate trees that bore fruit of molten silver" and the "lantern that burned without flame" are not just decorative but integral to the story's logic and resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly under the accumulative lens through the patterned visits and the bead's accelerating pulse. The final choice to pick the fruit is an act of agency that decisively reweights the dominant stake of ancestral debt, with the cost visible in the dissolved greenhouse and withered trees.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the transformation of debt into gift, culminating in the final, resonant image of offering the fruit to a stranger. The concept is answered non-literally through the boy's new understanding and the story's final, poignant line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, spectral quality that modulates perfectly with emotional intensity. The patterned elision of the seven visits is taught and pays off. POV is stable and deeply filtered through the ghost's perception, even in the boy's brief dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but maintains propulsion, with high information density and no scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though the phrase "resonant awakening" is repeated, creating a minor echo that prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of ghost bride and alchemical orchard tropes, transformed through specific, grounded choices. The core concept of debt as a "vine" that finds "any sun" feels inevitable in hindsight, and the risk-taking lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
