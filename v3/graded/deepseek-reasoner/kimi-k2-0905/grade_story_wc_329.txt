<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Calla's interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in her use of heart rhythms to signal. Her motivation to reawaken beauty is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling high-stakes choices. The final renunciation of looking back is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (orchard transformed, path lit west) with undeniable conceptual cost (statues freezing, bridge dissolving). The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pattern density toward the final seed pulse. The locust shell's late functional clarity is a minor hairline slip.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is intensely pressurized and constrains choice at every turn (bridge sway, statue patrols). The enchanted orchard and its mechanical guardians are not merely described but actively shape tactics. The final image of the bridge dissolving into dawn is charged by the specific, lived-in environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Calla's agency under the accumulative lens—each musical choice deepens the stakes and narrows her options. The cost is legible in the frozen statues and the dissolved bridge. The dominant stake (reawakening beauty) is tested and transformed on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of breaking free emerges organically from concrete actions (playing backward, uprooting seed) and the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The concept integrates fully with character motive and world logic, resisting tidy morals through the lingering taste of "escape."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature ("dusk air," "tarnished wonder"). The lyrical compression is purposeful and taught, paying off at closure. The voice remains coherent under peak pressure, with rhythmic control supporting the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic variety. Minor risk of metaphorical strain ("sunrise heard through closed eyes") but clarity remains intact. No loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances the accumulative pattern toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of musical magic and mechanical decay feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of "breaking free" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
