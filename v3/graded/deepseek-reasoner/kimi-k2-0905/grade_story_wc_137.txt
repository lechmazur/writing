<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction (skepticism vs. yearning) is embodied and drives the entire narrative. Her final choice to listen and transcribe for the "choir inside her" is a decisive change earned by the tile's visceral assault on her rationality. The cost of her renounced worldview is felt in the new "hollow space" she carries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara integrates into a larger human symphony, her stride syncing with a "pulse not entirely her own." The accumulative lens holds perfectly, building through sensory and emotional density. Cost is legible in the relinquishment of the tile and the acceptance of an unprovable truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tower, tile, and whale song are not just vivid but actively constrain and enable choice. The tower's porous walls and the astrolabe are tools Mara uses to navigate her crisis. The final image of the sky as parchment waiting for the next skeptic charges the closure, though the tower's magical properties are slightly less constrained than its sensory ones.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: Mara's courageous choice to "listen instead of refute" after the initial shock is the key tightening. This deepens the stake from academic duty to participatory connection, with the cost of her old self legible in the transcribed symphony she offers back.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of connection versus isolation emerges entirely through event and image (the tile's memories, the whale song, the shared symphony). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: truth is found in participatory feeling, not solitary proof. The final image of the calf breaching perfectly encapsulates "continued becoming."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a poetic yet precise perceptual signature ("unheard symphony," "salt galaxies"). The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mara's scientific yet yearning consciousness. The lyrical density is purposeful and taught, never obscuring causality or closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush but meticulously controlled, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion. Figurative language ("tuning fork," "salt galaxies") is coherent and purposeful. A single potential artifact—"courageously kind" feeling slightly label-like—is minor and does not touch the closure's clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A highly original and ingenious synthesis of magic and science, memory and migration, skepticism and faith. The core concept of a "keel stone" for temporal voyages is fresh and fully committed to, transforming the familiar "magic object" trope through specific, grounded logic and profound emotional stakes.</comment>
