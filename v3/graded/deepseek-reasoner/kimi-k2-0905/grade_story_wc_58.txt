<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("ink-stained fingers trembling"). The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with the protagonist's self-recognition as her own first client providing a decisive change with visible cost. Contradictory impulses act in scene, particularly in the climactic moment of intimate recognition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise of "explained absences" into "presences waiting to be recognized." The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with the weft thread's transformation serving as the culminating pattern break. Cost is legible on the page in the final image of the empty notebook and the protagonist's aching joints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The shadowed garden functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image, with its paths spelling out words she'd written. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("autumn light filtered through bare branches like pale fingers"). The environment evolves with her actions, becoming a portal for transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with each turn of the thread narrowing options until the final self-confrontation. The cost is unmistakable in the physical and emotional toll of the vigil. The dominant stake of understanding the geography of healing is signaled early and paid off definitively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The theme of absence transforming into presence emerges organically from events and images, culminating in the resonant, non-literal final realization that "every explained absence was really just a presence waiting to be recognized." The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, offering profound thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature that filters the world through the obituary writer's professional lens. The prose has a lyrical, textured quality that modulates with emotional intensity. Minor artifacting appears in phrases like "lonesome splendor" which, while thematically relevant, edges toward label-speak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor figurative muddle occurs in the "pale fingers" simile which slightly strains coherence. Otherwise, sentences advance story and character without scaffolding or redundancy, maintaining clear propulsion through peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The core premise of writing obituaries for the living is brilliantly original and fully committed to its implications. The synthesis of carpet-weaving, absence, and healing feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, creating a singular artistic vision.</comment>
