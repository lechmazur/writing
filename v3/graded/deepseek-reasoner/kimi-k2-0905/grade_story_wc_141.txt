<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arlen's motivation ("grim cheerfulness") is concrete and contradictory, driving micro-choices like retelling voices. His final renunciation—leaving the cello "porous"—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the heartbeat sacrifice. Embodied emotion avoids diagnostic speak, though peak stress clarity is slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of three notes intensifies to a fourth silence, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing of the riddle. Closure lands on-page with cost ("drink his heartbeat"); orientation is immediate and pattern-taught. The ephemeral compass's rule is established and paid off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The observatory and cello constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Arlen's expertise ("plaster constellations"). The seashell and compass are micro-settings that alter tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: each retold voice deepens stakes and narrows options. Cost is legible in the cracking shell and heartbeat sacrifice. The dominant stake (decoding the riddle) is tested and reweighted, though the external pressure remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("why listeners insisted on difference") that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in the cello's completion and the compass's silence. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature ("bruised sky," "tasting of mildew and star-dust"). Purposeful compression and lyrical diction are pattern-taught and legible. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., the three sounds) serves closure. Rhythm controls pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful ("coffin," "fireflies"). Minor template cadence in the three-note structure is pattern-taught. No loops or artifacts; closure clarity is untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of myth and science feels inevitable. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation, conceptual repricing) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise is transformed through specific detail (cello, seashell). Avoids template plots; bold choices cohere.</comment>
