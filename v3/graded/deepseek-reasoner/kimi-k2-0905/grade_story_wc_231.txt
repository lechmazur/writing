<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maris's characterization is deeply specific and embodied, with her professional training ("trained by years of watching light rotate across darkness") directly informing her unique method of investigation. Her internal conflict and micro-choices feel authentic under pressure, particularly her decision to "read those absences" and later release the flower, a final choice earned by the story's causality. The only minor limitation is the story's intense focus on her isolation, which, while powerful, slightly narrows the range of contradictory impulses shown on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is taught immediately and held flawlessly, with the pattern of "gaps" escalating coherently to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is achieved through Maris's decisive action of releasing the Edelweiss, an Earned Stasis that forecloses the cycle of debt with a visible, felt cost—the draining of "borrowed memories." The final image of the lighthouse turning "without ticking" is a masterful conceptual repricing that reweights the entire premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is not merely atmospheric but actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The mist, the lighthouse mechanics, and the opal dock are all tactile forces that shape Maris's actions. The Edelweiss itself functions as a micro-setting, its physical properties ("brittle bloom," "petals loosening") directly enabling the climax. Sensory detail is exquisitely selective and purposeful, fully filtered through Maris's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the intensifying pattern of gaps, each one a meaningful tightening that deepens the central stake of decoding the stranger's gesture. Maris's agency is paramount; her choice to fill the gaps by sacrificing her own memories is the turn that drives the resolution. The cost is unmistakable and legible on the page as her recollections are physically carried away.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of borrowed memory and the central image of the lighthouse as a keeper of what the sea forgets. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to this question through the act of release, reconfiguring the meaning of the keeper's role from investigating to "only attending." The final paragraph crystallizes this thematic resonance without a hint of moralizing or statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature deeply aligned with Maris's worldview. The prose rhythm masterfully modulates to match the story's eerie, suspended atmosphere. Purposeful elision (e.g., the erased sound of footsteps) is taught early and pays off at closure. There is no head-hopping or register drift, only a consistent, compelling lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exemplary, with high information density and rhythmic control. The prose is lush but precise, with metaphors ("the way fog hums in a bell") that are original, coherent, and deeply integrated. A single instance of potential density—"a witnessed isolation suspended between iron and cloud"—is voice-motivated and pattern-taught, thus not penalized. The closure beat is executed with flawless clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story synthesizes its elements into a strikingly original and inevitable whole. The core premise of a debt paid with "memory interest" is a fresh, non-obvious angle on a supernatural encounter. The specific, grounded choices in character (a lighthouse keeper), method (observing gaps), and object (Edelweiss) feel organic and indispensable. The bold, quiet ending is a significant risk that pays off, heightening meaning without a trace of gimmickry.</comment>
