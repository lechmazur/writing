<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion under pressure. Her fiercely meditative nature drives micro-choices and culminates in an earned renunciation of her old carving purpose. The final choice to create gardens instead of stones is motivated by prior causality and carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing where grief is reweighted as transformation. The spectral mentorship pattern is taught early and pays off at closure with undeniable cost. The final image of the transformed ribbon roll decisively reconfigures meaning and options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the carver's POV. The greenhouse environment and butterfly wings actively constrain choices and charge the final image. The "thundering calm" motif recurs with reweighted meaning, perfectly supporting tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with pressure cohering through discovered chrysalises and headstones. Cost is legible when she finally feels the weight of carried grief. The dominant stake (understanding collective grief) tightens meaningfully through her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete images and events, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer to grief's shape. The final realization that memorials must be lived, not carved, reweights all prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the butterfly's poetry and wrapped chrysalises.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose has a textured, lyrical quality that modulates with emotional intensity without obscuring clarity. Purposeful elision (sleep-carving) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing rather than muddying peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, accelerating and breathing with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief processing and natural transformation feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of gravestone carving, butterfly migration, and poem-trading creates a fresh, non-obvious angle. Risk-taking in spectral mentorship heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
