<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in consistent traits of longing and duty. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, shown through embodied actions like brushing soil from a skull and whispering a hymn. The final choice to rebuild is earned by prior causality and carries a visible cost of relinquishing her former life, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the reassembled prayer house and harmonizing catacombs confirm faith's return. The accumulative lens holds perfectly, building through layered discoveries. Cost is legible on the page in the image of her exile's hollow spaces being filled, and the sundial base acts as a persistent constraint shaping the final tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is not merely described but is the active crucible of the story, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through the protagonist's POV. The setting's rules are consistent and learned through action, and the spatial choreography of following the "root-road" is coherent and impactful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens, with each discovery (the fractured skull, the humming mirrors, the moving roots) deepening the stakes and narrowing her path toward the climactic act of rebuilding. The cost is unmistakable, as her purposeful wandering leads to the irrevocable choice to stay and teach, foreclosing her path of exile.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment>A coherent theme of faith, loss, and cyclical return emerges entirely through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the cemented sundial base, confirming that time and faith are rebuildable. The concept of "interrupted journeys" is richly explored and reweighted without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The lyrical, dense prose is entirely voice-motivated and serves the accumulative drive lens. Purposeful compression (e.g., "across excavating a tomb") is taught and pays off, enhancing the mythic tone without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and clear propulsion. There is a minor tendency toward ornamental language ("myrrh-scented air, cautious enchantment thick as honey") in one peak beat, applying slight decorative pressure, but it does not obscure causality or closure. The final paragraph's rhythm is masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of diaspora return, archeology, and magical realism feels organic and fresh. The core concept of interrupted journeys is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the catacomb setting and the sundial object. The story commits fully to its premise, and the final reconfiguration is both inevitable and surprising, a hallmark of high originality.</comment>
