<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her final choice to dismantle the instrument is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under stress are specific and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation feels inevitable due to established flaw: her need to reclaim creativity crushed by authority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing where her dissolution redefines creativity's value with undeniable cost. Orientation is immediate and functional; the taught pattern of celestial communication pays off at closure. The final image of the glass circle charges the ending with lasting conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the aurora-lit archway and astronomical instrument constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through POV bias. The environment evolves causally with events, and the instrument's dismantling directly shapes the climax. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens; each meteor syllable deepens stakes and narrows options. Cost is legible in the instrument's shudder and her dissolution. Though stakes are slightly abstract (soul-colorblindness), the personal cost to her creativity grounds the tension effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images; the final answer to creativity's imperative is resonant and non-literal. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication (e.g., teachers' scissors snipping paper). The core concept of remembered stardust is fully integrated into the narrative arc and closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct; voice has a strong perceptual signature with rhythmic control under pressure. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. The prose reflects the dreamer's mind and state consistently, with no head-hopping or register drift. Elision is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats. Minor deduction for occasional dense phrasing ("migraine of unborn constellations"), but clarity remains intact and closure is undimmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis feels inevitable; specific, grounded choices transform the trope of artistic struggle. Risk-taking in structure and perspective heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is fresh and fully committed to, with emotional specificity avoiding generic templates.</comment>
