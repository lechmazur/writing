<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s affectionate skepticism is embodied and consistent, driving micro-choices like her muttered comment to the geode. Her motivation intensifies credibly from curiosity to a crystallized purpose to help victims. The final choice to create and distribute shields is earned by prior causality, with a visible cost in her feverish work. A minor deduction for the "willowglass hope" phrase, which edges toward label-speak in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong causal lens holds throughout, with the static shock activating the geode and triggering a because/therefore chain of discovery. Closure is a decisive change (DC) achieved on the page as Mira’s private refuge becomes a public sanctuary, with a clear cost in her transformed purpose. The orientation is immediate and the geode’s purpose is fully paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The light painting studio and geode sliver function as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables Mira’s choices, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV as a creator. The environment evolves from a private refuge to a public laboratory, mirroring her internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency under the causal lens, from discovery to testing to a breakthrough. The dominant stake (mental privacy) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully as she tests frequencies and creates shields. The cost is legible in her all-night work and the tangible relief of Mrs. Chen.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of privacy and connection emerges organically from the core concept and Mira’s actions, resisting moralizing. The final image of the geode offers a resonant, non-literal answer about trusting science and intuition. A minor deduction for the slightly explicit "willowglass hope" tone label, which briefly tells the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Mira’s perception, with a distinct perceptual signature. The prose has a controlled, precise rhythm that matches her analytical nature. The single line of dialogue feels natural and character-specific. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences advance story and character simultaneously. Minor artifacts include the slightly precious "willowglass hope" and a template cadence in "Working through the night, Mira devised...". These do not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a technological disaster with a mineralogical solution feels fresh and non-obvious, yet inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded particulars. The risk of a sci-fi premise healed by art and science pays off with coherence.</comment>
