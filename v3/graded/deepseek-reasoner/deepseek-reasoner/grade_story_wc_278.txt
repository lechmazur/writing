<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is deeply rooted in specific guilt and professional penance, with embodied interiority ("a dissonant chord from a past failure"). Her final choice to tether the cry is earned by prior causality and reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The only minor flaw is a slight abstraction in "the dissonance in her head hushed," but it's quickly grounded in the amber's physical transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds perfectly: Alistair's failure corrupts the code, Elara's work resurrects it, her discovery of the letters explains the loop, and her action breaks it. Closure is a decisive change with clear cost ("The screaming spectrograms... flattened into gentle waves"). The orientation is immediate and the structure is taut, with no wasted moves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The laboratory is a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables Elara's choice, particularly the server and the amber. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("meteor hush," "honey-gold piece of amber"). The amber charges the final image and is integral to the resolution, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start: hushing internal dissonance. Escalation is driven by the glitch's personal torment and the discovery of the letters, forcing a decisive action. The cost is legible in the final quieting of the cry and the amber's transformation, a direct result of her agency under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of guilt, preservation, and cyclical pain emerges organically through the concrete actions of sound archiving and the amber's use. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the pacified cry imprisoned in amber. It avoids moralizing, though the concept of "time folds in on itself" is slightly more stated than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and consistent, with a poetic, precise perceptual signature ("meteor hush of captured and catalogued absences"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's expertise and grief. The elision of how the letters are exactly found is purposeful and does not harm clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and virtually flawless. Sentences are propulsive and multi-tasking ("The sound stretched, thinned, and was siphoned into the tiny golden tomb"). No loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle. The opening and closing lines are perfectly crafted to anchor and resolve the story's emotional weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of constellation tattooing, sound preservation, and haunted firmware is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded choices in character and plot. The transformation of a common trope (ghost in the machine) through personal, emotional specificity is masterful.</comment>
