<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("a taste of copper in his mouth"). The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with the mask strap's discard providing a visible cost. The motivation shift from endurance to absolution is clear and intensifies under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) landing with undeniable cost as he discards the mask strap. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern recognition escalating toward the final, thematic realization. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, fully integrated into the POV's perception and the story's thematic logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by the protagonist's agency in collecting "variables." The dominant stake (discovering absolution) tightens meaningfully, culminating in a choice with a clear, on-page cost at the obsidian pedestal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The final realization that "the mathematics of mercy was not an external constant" reweights all prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature. The prose's dense, lyrical texture is consistent, voice-motivated, and legible, effectively reflecting the protagonist's enhanced, painful awareness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and rhythmic, though a few metaphors ("living cartography of his own pain") verge on strain. Overall, it maintains propulsion and clarity, with no loops or scaffolding obscuring the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of trauma recovery, mathematical obsession, and a bioluminescent world is specific, non-obvious, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with high originality and authenticity.</comment>
