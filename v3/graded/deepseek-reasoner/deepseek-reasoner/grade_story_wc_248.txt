<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is deeply specific, with her "volcanic tenderness" and "analytically intuitive" approach creating a compelling contradiction. Her final choice to leave the tapestry is a powerful Earned Stasis, foreclosing her path of isolation with a visible cost. The academic backstory, while potent, is slightly summarized, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, building to a resonant reconfiguration where Elara's choice to gift the archive redefines her purpose. The closure lands with undeniable cost as she watches from a distance, her heart a "volcano of hope and fear." The structure is taught and purposeful, with each shard contributing to the final, powerful image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is a masterclass in specificity and function. The municipal annex's "aging bones" and the "cool and still" air of the archive are not just described but are integral to the plot. The faded tapestry fragment is the ultimate example of a micro-setting object that constrains choice and charges the final image, making its discovery the story's pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the density of discoveries—first the slab, then the archive, then the fragment—each deepening the stakes of Elara's mission. The cost is legible in her "weary sigh" and the "magma" of her old urge to burn, which she must overcome. The final, decisive act of not burning the tapestry is a powerful, agency-driven escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between hoarded and shared knowledge, embodied in the contrast between the university and Elara's public art. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the child understanding the woven code, transforming the "vandalized self-portrait" from a scar into part of a "beautiful, larger picture" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's academic, obsessive consciousness, creating a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is consistently lyrical and precise ("smelling of dust and time"). A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the academic backstory summary, which briefly feels less embodied than the present-tense action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences like "Her fingers, blackened with soot, moving with a volcanic tenderness" do multiple jobs. A single, minor artifactor is the phrase "vandalized self-portrait," which, while powerful, risks leaning toward thematic echo, though it is quickly dramatized.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise—an arsonist librarian preserving knowledge—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of destruction and creation is executed with bold commitment, and the specific lived detail of the woven Kythian history grounds the high-concept idea in emotional truth and tangible stakes.</comment>
