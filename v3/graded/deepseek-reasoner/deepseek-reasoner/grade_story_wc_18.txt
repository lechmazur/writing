<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her tangible craft, compelling higher-stakes choices. Her shift from hunter to keeper is earned through on-page struggle, though the final renunciation lacks a visible contradictory impulse acting simultaneously in the climax beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost in the sextant's collapse. The pattern of density increase—frost glow, tree blossoms, mirror swelling—reweights the stake coherently, though the climax's physical threat is summarized rather than fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the orchard's fog and frost constrain perception and choice, while the sextant and mirror charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with "glass mountains" tone permeating every descriptive choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the mirror's near-shattering and the sextant's demise. The stake (capture vs. invitation) tightens meaningfully through her breathing method and will shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the core concept of erasing boundaries, culminating in a non-literal answer: beauty housed, not imprisoned. The final image reweights prior struggle without moralizing, though the thematic opposition (capture/invite) is slightly explicit in the climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("soup-like haze," "crystalline, immense"). Minor register drift occurs in the climax ("psychic storm"), but the voice remains coherent and purposefully compressed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong sentence-level propulsion. One mixed metaphor ("psychic storm" clashes with established glass/mountain fragility) slightly muddles peak clarity, but no loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dream-capture with navigational tools feels fresh and inevitable. The broken sextant's repurposing is a specific, grounded choice that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
