<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her micro-choices with the tooth reveal values. The final release earns its cost through prior causality. Embodied emotion avoids diagnostic speak, though "modest fearlessness" leans slightly abstract in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change with brilliant radiance of release, cost legible in the lingering laughter. Orientation is immediate, and the harp's distortion drives the turn without coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Echo Gorge constrains choice and charges the final image; the harp and tooth are tactile micro-settings. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara's expertise, with the sunrise framing closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Elara's agency in tuning the harp; the cost is visible in the spirit's transformation and Elara's lightened duty. One meaningful tightening suffices, driven by character choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the integration of laughter into healing; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like the tooth's warmth and the lingering laughter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature suited to a soul collector. Diction remains within Elara's lexicon, and rhythmic control heightens pressure during the tuning beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied sentence rhythms. Minor figurative stacking in "luminous ache" and "beautiful, painful weight" slightly softens peak clarity, but no loops or artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of soul collection with acoustic healing feels inevitable; the crocodile tooth as tuner is a fresh, irreplaceable inflection. Risk-taking in tone and concept coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
