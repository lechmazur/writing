<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alistair's withdrawn nature and motivation to "capture the shape of possibility" are concrete and compel his high-stakes choice to unsnap the puppet. His hesitation and the "terrifying and ecstatic rush" of potential are embodied and contradictory, avoiding diagnostic speak. The final renunciation of the "old story" is earned by the causality of his observant journey.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Alistair's armor lightens "in his soul" and the "luminous possibility" becomes his squire, reconfiguring his purpose with undeniable cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density and a single, meaningful tightening—the unsnapping ritual. The cost is legible in the "wave of shivering bliss" and the calm, blank-page reality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard is indispensable, constraining choice via the "unstable ground" and supplying the key object (the marionette). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("ozone and blooming nectar," "equations of light"). The greenhouse itself charges the final image, its atmosphere breathing in time with the ritual and then stilling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Alistair's agency under the accumulative lens, the pressure cohering and tightening through the ritual of unsnapping. Each clasp released increases the tremor, a decisive intensification that reweights the dominant stake of possibility. The cost is unmistakable in the "shivering bliss" and the palpable shift in reality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of releasing old stories to embrace potential emerges organically from the specific action of unsnapping the puppet. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the "knight unburdened by past failures." It resists a tidy moral, sitting in the complex, blissful terror of pure potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature ("armor had grown heavier with silence"). The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity. The non-sound voice of the orchard is a purposeful, pattern-taught elision that pays off, enriching the textural design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("cathedral of glass and iron"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with the unsnapping. There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts to obscure the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a withdrawn knight, an alchemical orchard, and a marionette ritual feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through on, transforming familiar tropes (knight's quest, puppet) through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
