<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's altruism is a consistent, embodied driver that intensifies under pressure, compelling her to expend her energy. Her final dissipation is a credible renunciation with visible cost. However, her internal contradiction is more summarized than dramatized in simultaneous action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong causal lens holds: the chalk messages create clear "therefore" linkages that direct community action. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the nebula's arrival and the final message, "You are the garden," reconfiguring meaning with a clear, felt cost in Elara's dissipation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating quartz arches are not just decorative; they pressure the central conflict of drought. The bell is a key object that constrains and enables choice, and its specific, tactile description ("tiny valves," "capillary tubes") is integrated into the action of repair.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through a meaningful tightening: the initial failure of the water trickle raises the cost, forcing Elara's final, desperate act. This escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, and the cost of her dissolution is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of collective hope and found family emerges organically from the events, culminating in the resonant, non-literal final image and message ("You are the garden"). It avoids moralizing, offering a complex answer that reweights the community's understanding of itself and its ghostly guide.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filtered through Elara's spectral perception. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in phrases like "a brambled thing," which feels slightly outside a ghost's immediate lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements of story and atmosphere. No significant loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle to detract from clarity or momentum, especially in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a altruistic ghost guiding a community via chalk messages on an orchard planet is a fresh, non-obvious concept that feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking with a non-corporeal protagonist heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
