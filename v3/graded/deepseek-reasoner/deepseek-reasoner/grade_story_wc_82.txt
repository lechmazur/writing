<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying from failed origami to masterful lantern craft. Her internal conflict is embodied through "clumsy with paper" versus "skilled with glass," showing contradictory impulses. The final choice to release the crane is earned by prior causality with visible cost—"the weight of her sorrow finally leaving her."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building density through imagery and emotional pattern. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the light-crane ascends, reconfiguring grief into beauty with felt cost: "so beautiful it ached to look upon." The lens holds without contradiction, and the final image charges prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the floating island tea garden and glass basilica constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details like "ozone and jasmine" reflect POV bias. The amber gem and lantern architecture are micro-settings that shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from failed cranes to lantern construction. The dominant stake (transforming grief) tightens through her craft, with cost legible in the "luminous torment" of the final crane. Pressure coheres and deepens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through transformation of grief into art, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures like "her breath giving shape to her pain." The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity through the crane's aching beauty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature marked by "subtle geometries of light." Syntax and rhythm reflect Elara's state, modulating under pressure. Purposeful compression (e.g., "luminous torment") is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm and variation. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Minor artifact: "descends while ascending" slightly echoes earlier phrasing but does not obscure closure. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple layers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief, craft, and light magic feels inevitable and fresh. The lantern-as-basilica and dream recording are transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative or template elements.</comment>
