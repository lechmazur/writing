<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hideo's motivation ("to appreciate hidden effort") is consistently embodied through his actions and perception. His final choice to demonstrate rather than argue reveals his hierarchy of values. The headman's intrusion creates a micro-choice to prove his philosophy, not just state it, with the cost of his quiet ritual being interrupted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held. Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the headman's worldview is reweighted by the firefly net's brief, perfect formation. The cost is the headman's silenced pragmatism, made legible in his breathless stare and quiet departure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The "whispering parapet" and "scintillatingly somber air" are not just atmosphere; they are the crucible for the action. The damp stone and mist are tactile constraints for sitting and seeing. The setting's specific, lived-in quality charges the final image of the net of light dissolving back into the dark.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift: the headman's intrusion breaks the pattern of solitary ritual, forcing a demonstration. Hideo's agency is his renunciation of speech for action, narrowing the headman's options and reweighting the dominant stake of value with a clear, on-page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of finding value in the overlooked emerges organically from Hideo's perception and the fireflies' dance. The final image of the perfect net is a resonant, non-literal answer. A minor deduction for Hideo's final line, which slightly tells the theme he has already shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Hideo's philosophical, attentive consciousness. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with the scene's quiet intensity. The voice is perfectly calibrated to the character and his world, with no artifacts or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional line-level craft. Sentences are purposeful and propulsive, with a varied, rhythmic cadence that supports the contemplative mood. High information density; every image serves character, atmosphere, and theme. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle, even in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a net-mender philosopher using a tea whisk to read patterns of light is a fresh, non-obvious, and organic concept. The specific, grounded choices in character and world make the premise feel inevitable and singular, avoiding cliché or template plotting.</comment>
