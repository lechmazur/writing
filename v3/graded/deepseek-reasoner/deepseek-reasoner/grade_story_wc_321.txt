<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's "resiliently positive" nature is a consistent, active trait that motivates his puzzle-solving approach to the crisis, a credible endurance rather than a breakdown. However, his emotional state during the peak anomaly is summarized ("his positive nature, now tested to its limit") rather than fully embodied in contradictory, irrational stress responses, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive, on-page Decisive Change (synchronizing timelines) with a clear, felt cost (the profound understanding tempering his smile). The inferred Causal lens holds: the radio provides a logical 'therefore' signal, and his choice to place and turn the hourglass is the active, earned resolution. The final image of the paperweight solidifies the cost and change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ferry and spectral grotto are not just vivid backdrops but active constraints that shape choice and charge the final image. The grotto's "natural pillar of rock" provides the crucial platform for the climax, and the return to the "bustling morning ferry" is the tangible proof of the closure's success, making the setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, escalation is clean: the thinning passengers and chaotic radio transmissions logically narrow options to a single point of convergence. Leo's agency in steering the ship and turning the glass is the decisive act that resolves the pressure. The cost is the transformation of his simple positivity into a "profound understanding," felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of transience versus permanence emerges organically from the core concept and Leo's role, culminating in the resonant, non-literal final image of the ferry as a place of "permanent transience." His action "synchronizing" time rather than "fixing" it provides a sophisticated, earned answer to the central disruption, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, slightly poetic filter ("time when clocks run sideways") that remains consistent under pressure. The single line of dialogue from the woman ("Thanks, Leo") effectively carries the weight of the merged timelines through subtext and echo, fulfilling its purpose economically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean and purposeful with strong sensory detail ("salty spray," "cold, empty hourglass"). A minor deduction for a slight scaffold moment in the climax: "His positive nature, now tested to its limit, was his only compass" summarizes a state that could be more deeply dramatized, creating a small momentum dip in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core concept of a vanishing ferry and temporal fracture is executed with high originality, transformed through the specific, grounded lens of a deckhand's routine. The synthesis of a mundane setting with a cosmic problem feels fresh and inevitable, and the resolution through a simple, physical act (turning the glass) is a bold, specific choice that heightens stakes.</comment>
