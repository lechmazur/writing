<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied ("calloused and soil-streaked hands"). The final choice to plant light is a credible, character-specific action that earns its emotional resolution. Minor deduction for a brief telling moment ("The feeling was one of protected vulnerability") that summarizes rather than dramatizes the complex state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) achieved through the protagonist's agency. The cost of the rose's loss is felt, and the final image of the "tiny constellation" reconfigures her stance with undeniable conceptual and emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The fire escape, tools, and harbor are not merely described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The lockmaster's gauge tooth is the standout element, evolving from a practical tool to a source of transcendent light, perfectly integrating setting and object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's internal pressure and her active response to loss. The dominant stake (emotional balance) is tightened through her ritual and culminates in the ingenious act of "planting light," which carries a clear, felt cost of the rose's passing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of specific images: gardening, locksmithing, and light. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to loss and creation without moralizing. The transformation of the gauge tooth is a masterful thematic synthesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's perceptive, melancholic, yet pragmatic consciousness. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity. The voice is consistently vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in a few spots (e.g., "the water was a sheet of black glass shattered...") which, while beautiful, momentarily risks density over clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a fire escape gardener using a locksmith's tool to plant light is brilliantly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is transformed through grounded, specific choices that heighten stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
