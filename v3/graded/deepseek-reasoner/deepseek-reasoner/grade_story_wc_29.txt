<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's cautious hope is a consistent, embodied trait that motivates her desperate, high-stakes counter-move. Her interiority is concrete and particular, with micro-choices under pressure (recalibrating the dish) revealing her values. The final smile is an earned emotional progression, though the transition from crushed hope to blossoming hope is slightly swift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly: her actions directly cause the signal's unraveling. Closure is a decisive change (DC) with clear on-page cost in her exhaustion and the town's collective sigh. The orientation is immediate, and the plot is a coherent, motivated sequence from problem to solution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional POV (grease-smudged hands, stinging eyes). The radio station setting supplies the crucial resource (the dish) for her plan. However, the setting's potential to pressure choices more directly (e.g., through colleagues) is not fully realized, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the causal lens, pressure escalates cleanly from the town's division to her gamble with the transmission. The dominant stake (world's safety) is tested by the long moment where "nothing happened," a superb tightening. The cost of her effort is legible on the page, and her agency drives the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (division vs. unity, communication as weapon) emerges organically from the central conflict and the specific solution. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—peace earned by a "deepest of whispers"—that reweights the premise without moralizing. The concept is fully integrated into the narrative's fabric.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature ("ethereal grit"). The prose's rhythm and diction expertly modulate with the emotional intensity of the climax. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and the voice remains coherent and compelling throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously ("a work of ethereal grit"). A minor instance of scaffold phrasing ("a collective, unconscious sigh seemed to pass through the town") prevents a 9.0+ score, but overall, the line-level craft is exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of first-contact tropes with psychological warfare and a subsonic solution feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is executed with high conceptual integrity, committing fully to its implications. The specificity of the protagonist's methodology and the quiet ending are significant, successful risks.</comment>
