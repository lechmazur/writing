<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her identity as a balladeer, with her internal conflict (silent self vs. need to sing) mirroring the ghost's plight. Her actions under pressure are embodied and specific, culminating in a micro-choice to place her hands on the plate that feels earned. The final choice to encode the ghost's essence is a decisive change that forecloses her own silence with a visible cost—the release of her voice. The only minor flaw is the slightly decorative phrase "tinkersong wonder," which feels like a label rather than fully embodied emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through sensory density and a cadence shift (the storm) that forces the climax. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the ghost is stabilized into art and Elara's voice returns, with cost legible in the "sigh" of relief and the solidified mist. Orientation is immediate and precise. The linkage from setup (graffiti calls) to climax (encoding) is coherent and taught, with the final image reconfiguring the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The misty courtyard is a micro-setting that actively pressures the choice (isolation, storm) and charges the final image (mist solidifying into walls). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's perception (e.g., "cold, damp stone"). The flower press itself functions as a key object-as-setting, constraining her actions and evolving in use. The environment is indispensable to the story's logic and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by the increasing sensory and emotional density, culminating in the storm's cadence shift that forces the encoding action. The dominant stake (giving voice to the voiceless) is tightened through Elara's agency, with a visible cost—her regained voice and the ghost's stabilization. The pressure coheres and grows until the final act reweights the options decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of giving voice to the voiceless emerges organically from the core concept and character struggle, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the shimmering gallery and Elara's first note. Subtext operates in the ghost's fragmented memories and the mirrored needs of Elara and the entity. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Elara's perceptual signature, with a distinct lyrical texture. Diction and syntax reflect her state under pressure ("driftingly alert," "heart hammered a tinkersong wonder"). The elision of how she understands the graffiti is purposeful and paid off by her kinship with the ghost. Minor risk of preciousness in "tinkersong" but overall voice is coherent and compelling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong rhythmic control and sensory specificity. However, there is minor overwriting in peak beats: "tinkersong wonder" and "deafening instant" slightly dilute the intensity with decorative phrasing. No loops or scaffolding issues. The closure image is clear and powerful, though a hairline slip in figurative consistency prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a digital ghost and a balladeer is fresh and inevitable in hindsight, executed with high conceptual integrity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and lyrical voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. A singular artistic stance with no derivative echoes.</comment>
