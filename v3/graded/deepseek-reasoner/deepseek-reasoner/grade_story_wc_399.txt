<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, singular, and intensifies under pressure. Her method of peripheral awareness is a concrete, character-particular trait that dictates her actions. The final choice to weave the scout's perception into the ritual is a credible micro-choice that reveals her values and resourcefulness. A slight deduction for the slightly elevated "whisperfield calm" descriptor feeling a touch contrived mid-crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via successful preservation) with clear, felt cost in Elara's weariness and the scout's confusion. The scout's arrival is a coherent complication that escalates the ritual, and his integration is a meaningful deepening that sharpens the final act. Causality is tight and purpose-driven throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is not just vivid but actively constrains and enables choice. The kinetic parapet is the essential tool for the ritual's success, and the murmuring pavilion's psychic pressure is the story's inciting condition. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Elara's unique perception. The environment is fully integrated into the plot's causality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through a single, powerful deepening: the scout's arrival. His unfiltered consciousness acts as a tool, raising the cost of the ritual by introducing a variable and narrowing Elara's options to incorporate him. The pressure is coherent under the accumulative lens, and the cost of her focus and eventual weariness is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of preserving transient wisdom emerges organically from the specific actions of capturing an echo. The scout's role introduces a subtextual layer about the value of pure, unguarded perception. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the wisdom humming in the stone, waiting. Avoids moralizing or explicit thematic statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Elara's specialized perception. The prose has a distinct, controlled texture that modulates with the ritual's intensity. The limited dialogue is natural and serves the moment's strange honesty. Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., the prophet's exact words) are taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly evocative and precise, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for one potential artifact: "whisperfield calm" risks feeling like a thesaurus-churn compound adjective. However, this is a single instance and does not obscure causality or dull the closure. The final paragraph is particularly strong and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a psychic archaeologist, a kinetic geological structure, and a ritual based on peripheral awareness feels fresh and organic. The core concept of capturing a "ghost of thought" is executed with specificity and avoids cliché. The scout's integration is a non-obvious, ingenious turn that heightens stakes. A singular artistic vision.</comment>
