<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is masterfully embodied, with her "chivalry that often left her hungry" creating immediate, specific contradiction. Her final choice to protect the unknown is earned by prior causality, pivoting on the apprentice's truth ("you do not come to take, but to find") and visibly costing her the client's fortune.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly: the apprentice's revelation directly causes Elara's re-evaluation and choice to amend, not steal. Closure is a decisive change (protecting the wonder) with clear cost (the lost fortune, the corrected sky). The persistent constraint of the "wrong sky" timeframe shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The icebound spire and "wrong sky" are not merely vivid but actively constrain choice, pressuring Elara's timed approach. The chessboard and pieces function as micro-settings, charged with meaning and directly enabling the final choice to protect the "mote of pure potential" inside the queen.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from a financial commission to a moral choice to protect wonder itself. The apprentice's confrontation is the key tightening, forcing a higher-stakes decision. Elara's agency drives the resolution, with the cost of her renunciation felt in the client's promise becoming "ash."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of protecting wonder over exploiting it emerges organically from the conflict, culminating in the resonant, non-literal final image of the "first true stars." The apprentice's dialogue ("drain the wonder") avoids moralizing, instead charging the thematic conflict through concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's perception. The apprentice's voice ("chime of falling icicles") is distinct yet coherent. A slight register elevation in the apprentice's wisdom ("sacredly playful concentration") is voice-motivated and does not break clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and vivid with high information economy ("breath pluming in the thin, frigid air"). A minor register drift occurs in the apprentice's dialogue ("aura... yearns"), leaning slightly therapeutic, but it is brief and does not muddy the crucial closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a heist structure with a metaphysical guardian dilemma feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "amending" a stalemate instead of winning it is a specific, ingenious inflection that transforms the familiar thief trope through a unique moral and tactical calculus.</comment>
