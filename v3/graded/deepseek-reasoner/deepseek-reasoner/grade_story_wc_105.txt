<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear, rooted in a deep personal wound, and intensifies under pressure. Her synesthesia is a unique, character-particular trait that constrains her actions and charges the final realization. The final choice to carry the sound back, understanding it may not "fix" anything, is an Earned Stasis that feels inevitable based on her journey.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens, the plot coheres beautifully. The mission's goal is clear, and the escalation is driven by the volatile geothermal window. Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Aris accepts that some wounds are for witnessing, not curing, with the cost felt in her tears and the story's final, haunting image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is not merely descriptive; it is the story's crucible. The sunken orchard and ghost ships pressure Aris's navigation, and the ashen forge is the literal and emotional destination. The environment actively constrains choice and overwhelmingly charges the final image, making it indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing the sound to heal her grandfather—is clear. Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency within the volatile "window," forcing her deeper into the graveyard. The cost is legible in the "devastating" color that cracks her vision and the tears in her helmet, charging the final, reconfigured stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept: the impact of memories as a physical, sonic force. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—that some wounds are not for fixing but for acknowledging—that reweights the entire quest without moralizing. It is profound and earned through the specific, painful capture of the "frequency of a promise dying."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply immersed in Aris's synesthetic perception, creating a distinct and compelling narrative voice. The prose's rhythm and diction masterfully modulate with the emotional intensity of the hunt and the climax's devastating capture. The elision of the grandfather's partner as a named character is a purposeful choice that focuses the emotional weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density and a varied, rhythmic cadence that supports the pressure of the dive. Figurative language ("a silent, perpetual scream," "shattering prism of obsidian and ice") is potent and coherent. A single minor scaffold phrase ("a battered marvel") is repeated but is pattern-taught and pays off, causing no material obscurity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The premise is strikingly original—a synesthetic deep-sea hunt for the sound of broken trust—and is executed with full conceptual integrity. The combination of high-concept sci-fi and deep emotional truth feels organic and inevitable, not a gimmick. The risk-taking in voice and concept heightens the stakes and meaning without ever obscuring clarity.</comment>
