<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's "logically emotional" drive is embodied through micro-choices under pressure, her hands "steady despite the fear." Her final stance crystallization as "part of the song" is earned by prior causality, with the cost felt in her heaving chest. A hairline deduction for the slightly diagnostic "logically emotional" label, though it is quickly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (DC) with clear cost under a Causal lens. The because/therefore linkage is tight: the ship's threat forces her to adapt the artifact's defense. The final image of the "adaptive song" and her changed role is legible and earned. The orientation is anchored immediately with who, where, and when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is not just described but actively pressures choices, its "frost-rimed pylons" and "grinding ice" constituting the central conflict. The lighthouse mechanism itself is a key tool that constrains her final, precise adjustment, charging the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: the ship's approach directly forces Elara's tactical adaptation. The cost is unmistakable—the artifact's distress, the physical pressure on the walls, and the silent vacuum before absolution. A single, meaningful tightening is executed perfectly for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of logical love protecting transient beauty emerges organically from the conflict, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the "shield of perfect sound." A minor deduction for the near-thematic statement "a logical outcome born from deep love," though it is supported by the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's engineer's perspective, with a distinct perceptual signature ("calculating harmonic offsets"). The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the pressure, and purposeful compression is used without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language ("low, mournful symphony") is purposeful and taught. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, accelerating with the sprint to the lighthouse and pausing on the final, immense note.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sonic defense mechanism within a lighthouse setting feels fresh and specific. The core concept of "sonic absolution" is ingeniously integrated into the plot and world logic. It is a strong, organic combination, though the corporate antagonist trope is less transformed.</comment>
