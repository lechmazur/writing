<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is concrete and rooted in specific trauma ("archivist of loss"). His final shift from discovery to testament is earned by the data-driven investigation and the memory of the reef. The embodied emotion ("profound, quiet heaviness") and micro-choice to create a monument feel authentic. A slight deduction for a minor diagnostic label ("delayed revelation") in the climax, though it is quickly grounded in concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant and holds. Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the understanding that disappearances are "slow, irrevocable thefts" reweights the entire premise. The cost is legible on the page in the image of the "salt-poisoned marsh." The discovery of the atlas page is a perfect inciting incident, and the linkage through data cross-referencing is tight and motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The station is a micro-setting that actively pressures the character, embodying his isolation and singular duty. Key objects—the atlas page, the console, the metal hull—constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("mildew-scented atlas," "cool steel wall"). The environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: Kael's obsessive cross-referencing represents a decisive intensification. The dominant stake (discovering truth) is clear, and the cost of the revelation is a profound, felt heaviness. The pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully from a pebble disrupting routine to a world-altering realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of irrevocable loss emerges organically from the juxtaposition of the old chart and modern data. The final image—the assembled monument—is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of disappeared paths. It embraces complexity without moralizing, sitting in the quiet heaviness of the cost. The reef's death and the lost estuary are powerful, particular anchors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Kael's professional and emotional lens. The prose has a distinct, controlled rhythm that modulates with pressure, from the "morse code of boredom" to a "measured beat for remembrance." The lyrical compression is purposeful and taught, paying off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete diction. Information density is excellent, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "a monument to the paths closed off"). A minor register drift occurs in the phrase "slow, irrevocable thefts," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon at the climax, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of climate change themes with a deeply personal, archival quest feels fresh and inevitable. The specific angle—a data analyst confronting ghost geographies—is a non-obvious and highly effective choice. The story commits fully to its quiet, melancholic premise and follows its implications without retreat, achieving a singular artistic stance.</comment>
