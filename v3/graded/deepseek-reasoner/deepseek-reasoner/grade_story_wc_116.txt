<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Keeper's motivation to "witness change without judgment" is clear, consistent, and compels his higher-stakes choice to journey into the fracture. His final renunciation of intervention is a credible Earned Stasis, earned by his established nature. A slight abstraction in his peak emotional state ("psychic weight") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear cost: the library's continued decay is the price of his non-intervention. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with escalation driven by a pattern break (the groan) and a decisive cadence shift into the vibrational realm. The origami swan's cryptic folds provide a taught, coherent method for the journey.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The overgrown library and obsidian refuge are not merely vivid; they actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The refuge is the portal for his journey, and the library's decay is the central stake. Sensory detail is exceptionally selective and purposeful, filtered entirely through the Keeper's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the Keeper's agency under the Accumulative lens: his choice to witness, not fight, is the pivotal turn that unravels the knot. The cost is the library's accelerated decay, though the stakes could feel more visceral. A single, meaningful pattern break and cadence shift are sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of witnessing change emerges organically from the Keeper's actions and the story's core concept. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of continued decay, reweighting the premise without moralizing. The integration of "regenerative silence" as a practiced concept elevates the thematic depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice possesses a distinct, lyrical, and consistent perceptual signature that perfectly matches the tone and concept. The POV is stable and the prose's rhythmic control under pressure is exceptional. Purposeful compression (e.g., the journey's description) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly purposeful, with excellent rhythmic variation. A minor instance of potential abstraction ("foundational pain") and a slightly over-stacked modifier ("beautiful decline") prevent a 9+ score, but these are hairline slips that do not harm closure clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of decay, observation, and quiet fantasy. The resolution through non-intervention feels inevitable in hindsight. The specific combination of elements (origami swan, vibrational realm, regenerative silence) creates a singular and memorable artistic stance.</comment>
