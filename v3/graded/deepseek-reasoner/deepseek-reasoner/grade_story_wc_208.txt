<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation shift from survival to artistic purpose is earned through the vision's transformative impact. Her embodied stress ("knuckles white, heart a frantic drum") and micro-choice to create a new sculpture demonstrate contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to scaffold complexity with simplicity feels inevitable given her prior epiphany about capturing the sea's "deep history."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the vision layers historical seekers, deepening Elara's knowledge and reconfiguring her purpose. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as her sculpture embodies the timewoven alliances, with cost felt in her abandonment of "whimsical" art. The archway's hum provides a persistent constraint that shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway constrains choice (shelter) and charges the final image (sculpture). Sensory details are purposefully selective—narrowing to "sheeting rain" during crisis, expanding to "deep, resonant turbine-hum" during revelation. The archway functions as both macro-setting and recurring object that evolves meaningfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from survival to artistic legacy under accumulative pressure. The vision deepens options by revealing the archway's true nature, forcing Elara to reimagine her purpose. Agency is demonstrated through her all-night sculpting session, with cost visible in her discarded old work and exhausted dawn completion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the sculpture's form—"scaffold of simplicity to support a universe of complexity." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how art captures deeper truths, avoiding moralizing. The hiker's reaction ("I feel… found") extends thematic resonance without explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV remains tightly anchored in Elara's perception, with voice modulating from frantic ("monstrous maw") to reverent ("timewoven alliances"). The "turbine-hum reverie" phrase slightly strains the nautical lexicon but is pattern-taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("the stone around her hummed, not with the storm’s fury, but with a deep, resonant turbine-hum reverie"). Minor artifact: "turbine-hum" feels slightly anachronistic in a magical context but is consistent and legible. No loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time-travel vision with artistic transformation. The magic lantern slide is a non-obvious vehicle for revelation. Risk-taking in layered historical visions pays off through thematic coherence and closure. Premise avoids template plots through specific nautical setting and driftwood sculptor occupation.</comment>
