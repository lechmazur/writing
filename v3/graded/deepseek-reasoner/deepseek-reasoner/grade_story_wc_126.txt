<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in family creed, compelling higher-stakes choices. Her internal conflict is dramatized when frustration mounts, then shifts to playing with silence. The final renunciation of fighting silence for honoring it is earned with visible cost (condensation, seedpod). Embodied emotion avoids diagnostic labels, though peak stress could show more perceptual degradation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence pattern intensifies until cadence shift (playing with silence) reweights stakes. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in seedpod split and condensation. Orientation is clear by paragraph one. No causality breaks; the dome discovery via acoustic perception is earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice (dome fracture entry, shipwreck navigation) and charges the final image (rust-crowned greenhouse). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "black mirror" water, "spectral cathedral"). Micro-setting (violin, bowl) evolves meaning. Spatial choreography is coherent during dive and entry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reviving life) tightens through accumulative pressure of silence. Escalation is driven by agency: Elara's choice to play with silence, not against it, forces stance crystallization. Cost is legible in seedpod split. No coincidence; resolution earned through character alteration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events: beauty in unfinished honored via playing with silence. Subtext operates in final image (pear in bowl, silence as canvas). No moralizing; resonant answer through condensation and seedpod. Lyric reprise of "chronic hush" reweights meaning without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct ("acoustically perceptive," "chronic hush"). Perceptual signature is character-specific (noticing hollow hum, condensation sounds). No head-hopping. Elision (greenhouse legend) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural where present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without overwriting. Rhythm varies naturally ("gentle tap on leaves," "soft sigh of a ripening pear"). No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates during climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Premise is fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic silence and acoustic rebirth. Tropes transformed through specific choices (violinist, sunken orchard). Emotional truth anchors originality. Risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
