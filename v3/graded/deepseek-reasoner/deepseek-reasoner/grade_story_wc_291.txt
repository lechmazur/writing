<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's prosopagnosia is a profound, embodied flaw that drives her unique method and the story's central revelation. Her motivation to awaken empathy is dramatized through her artistic process, culminating in a devastating wave of feeling that is earned and specific. The final choice to pursue the theory is a micro-choice revealing her values, foreclosing her prior clinical distance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change in knowledge and emotional state, landing with undeniable cost in the "devastating wave of feeling." The causal lens holds tightly: her methodical process (because) leads directly to the twin revelation (therefore), which reconfigures the entire case and her internal stakes. The orientation is immediate and the cost is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The quarry is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful sensory detail ("bowl of furrowed hush," mist coiling). It functions as a silent witness and a symbolic pressure chamber. However, while it contributes to atmosphere, it does not actively constrain a choice or decisively charge the final image, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens; her drawing is a series of investigative choices that tighten the possibilities until the revelation clicks into place. The dominant stake (solving the case/awakening empathy) is signaled early and the cost of the newfound empathy is felt on the page, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of finding truth through absence is fully integrated and emerges organically from the core premise. The final image of the "phantom face" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of connection, reweighting Elara's entire journey without moralizing. The complexity of the emotional resolution is earned and avoids tidiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's artistic, methodical perception, creating a distinct and compelling narrative voice. The prose has a controlled, precise rhythm that modulates perfectly with the story's quiet intensity. There is no head-hopping or register drift, even under peak emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are purposeful and advance character and atmosphere simultaneously ("The violence had been a sudden, passionate act..."). A minor instance of slightly abstract phrasing ("a collection of impressions") in a key beat prevents a perfect score, but there are no loops, artifacts, or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a face-blind portrait artist solving a cold case is brilliantly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is fully committed to and executed with high conceptual integrity, transforming a potential gimmick into a profound exploration of perception and empathy. The risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
