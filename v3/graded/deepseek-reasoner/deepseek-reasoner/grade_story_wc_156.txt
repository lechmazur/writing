<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with her role as a restorer; her "methodically playful" testing and final choice to complete the fracture reveal a hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion is specific ("the fox nickel warm in her hand"), and her final renunciation of certainty for curiosity is earned by the vision's cost. A hairline slip: the breeze activation feels slightly external to her agency, but her subsequent choice is decisive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the garden's permanent song is unlocked, with cost felt in the exchange of certainty for legacy. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory patterns to the vision and final act. The breeze is a minor causality question, but Elara's deliberate completion of the fracture provides strong agency. Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is not merely described but is the engine of the plot, constraining and enabling Elara's choices. The brass lotus and fractured sculpture are key objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("a pure, clear note that hung in the air like a liquid jewel"). Micro-setting (the coin, the tools) is fully integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from professional curiosity to legacy resurrection under the accumulative lens. The vision deepens the conflict, and Elara's final tap is a decisive act of agency that forecloses the path of mere restoration. The cost of embracing uncertainty is felt in the final image. The breeze complicates but does not resolve; her choice does.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between certainty and curiosity, subversion and art, without moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the permanent song and the warm coin. The nested awakenings structure deepens the thematic weight. No explicit thematic statements; all is earned through scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's professional, curious perception. Voice is distinct and consistent ("a ghost in the machine of pigment and limewash"). The prose rhythm is controlled, even under pressure. No dialogue, so those criteria are N/A. Minor rhythm issue in one complex sentence, but overall exemplary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information economy. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("like a liquid jewel"). One minor loop: "methodically playful" is used twice, but it's a character trait and feels intentional. Read-aloud rhythm is excellent. A single instance of slight abstraction ("a physical thing") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise of sonic alchemy and nested awakenings is highly original and fully committed to. The combination of restoration, forgotten science, and political subversion feels fresh and inevitable. The hobo nickel as a marker is a specific, irreplaceable detail. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure pays off at closure.</comment>
