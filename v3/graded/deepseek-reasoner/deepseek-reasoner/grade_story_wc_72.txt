<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Statue's transformation from certainty to nuanced understanding is earned through concrete micro-choices, embodied emotion ("stone heart did not beat, but something within it hummed"), and a final stance crystallization with visible cost. The historian's "incisively kind" motivation is dramatized through her probing thought and delicate threading action, not summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, landing with undeniable cost as the Statue reinterprets its entire reality. The cascading revelations are tightly linked, each deepening the next, from the initial probe to the final, transformative tone. The persistent constraint of the Statue's certainty shapes every tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The underwater garden is indispensable, constraining choice (the pressure, the need for the thread) and decisively charging the final image as a "lullaby" and "living tapestry." Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the Statue's perception, evolving from monochrome to vibrant meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's (historian's) agency under the Accumulative lens, her gentle probing and threading deepening the stakes from mere observation to guardianship. The cost is legible in the Statue's seismic shift in perception and the historian's departure, foreclosing her direct presence but opening a new path of understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of certainty versus nuanced guardianship emerges organically from events and images (pearls as debris then constellation), culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. The final reconfiguration of the garden's meaning offers profound thematic resonance without moralizing, deeply integrated with the character arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied in the Statue's stone consciousness. The prose has a distinct, rhythmic texture ("low grind of continental plates, the soft sigh of settling silt") that modulates with emotional intensity. The historian's telepathic "scream of color" provides a perfect voice contrast without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure ("monochrome telepathy" to "scream of color"). Rhythm is controlled and varied, accelerating with revelation and slowing for contemplative beats. Zero loops, scaffold, or artifacting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A singularly original synthesis of fantasy and philosophical inquiry. The core concept of a telepathic statue guarding a sunken city is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and a non-obvious, gentle resolution. The risk-taking in voice and perspective heightens stakes and coheres perfectly, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
