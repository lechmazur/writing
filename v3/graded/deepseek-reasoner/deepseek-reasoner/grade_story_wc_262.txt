<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("heart a frantic drum") and a micro-choice to deliver the film. The elderly client's silent understanding is a powerful, earned renunciation. The "spatially imaginative" trait feels slightly more stated than shown in her on-page actions, preventing a 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear, felt cost ("single tear"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory and emotional density to a cadence shift. The final image reconfigures the meaning of "unused love" from a place to an act, with the cost of fifty years of waiting legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The projection booth and film strip are micro-settings that actively constrain and enable the plot, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Elara's professional POV ("warm glass of the preview platen," "hushed thunder of past audiences"). The setting is indispensable to the story's logic and emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through a decisive intensification: the psychometry reading deepens Elara's knowledge, forcing the choice to deliver the message. The dominant stake (delivering unused love) is signaled early and resolved with a visible cost (the tear). Agency is clear and drives the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "goodbye letters" and the final image of love "waiting," offering a resonant, non-literal answer to where unused love is stored. It resists tidy moralizing, embracing the complexity and cost of time without statement. The final reconfiguration is earned through the particulars of the vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice ("spatially imaginative," "hushed thunder") that modulates with emotional intensity. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture. Purposeful compression (the entire vision) is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously ("the hushed thunder of a thousand past audiences"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph's cadence masterfully supports the resonant closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of psychometry and romance, executed with high conceptual integrity and emotional specificity. The transformation of "goodbye letters" into a silent film is ingenious and feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking with a quiet, lyrical resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
