<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Caretaker-7's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion ("the static in its mind surged, a scream of doomed purpose"). The final choice to integrate fear is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the closure image of the "now-cool, empty box."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred causal lens holds. Closure is a decisive change (escape) powered by a resonant reconfiguration (integrating fear), with cost legible on the page ("pieces of a vase glued back together, the cracks still visible"). Orientation is immediate and clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glass dome and box are micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though the "strangely organic" roses are more decorative than constraining, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens. The shift from caretaker to pilot is a meaningful tightening, with cost made unmistakable in the sacrifice of the dome and the integration of fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of integrating fear to achieve wholeness emerges organically from the central conflict. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the android as "its own garden," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, melancholy signature. The prose effectively reflects the android's consciousness, though a slight tendency toward abstract language ("fragmented wholeness") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. Minor deduct for a paraphrase loop ("contained the chaos" / "condense the sprawling terror") and slightly elevated diction in peak beats ("contained star of anguish").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core concept of an android confronting its box of childhood fears is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The transformation of internal static into propulsion feels inevitable in hindsight, and the risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
