<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her personal creed. Her final choice to discard the star fragment is a credible micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values. However, her internal conflict and contradictory impulses are more summarized than dramatized in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) achieved through an accumulative/textural lens. The cost is legible in the "profound peace" and the final image of listening to a star's birth. The structure coheres perfectly, with the discarded artifact paying off the initial setup and the lunar perigee providing consistent pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is exceptional and indispensable. The suspended city and gorge are not just backdrop; they physically constrain the action of throwing the star fragment away. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara's professional POV, charging the final image with tangible weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from failed assumption to radical subtraction. The dominant stake (interpreting the signal) is clear, and the final, decisive act of discarding the artifact carries a visible cost—the loss of a tangible connection to Earth's history—which charges the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of finding beginnings in endings is fully integrated, emerging from the specific action of discarding noise to find truth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of a star's birth, reweighting the entire narrative without moralizing. The concept of "fantasy practicality" is perfectly realized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply embodied in Elara's professional, precise perception. The prose has a distinct, controlled texture that modulates with the intensity of the moment. The voice is consistent and effectively conveys the shift from frustrated effort to reverent discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor artifacts prevent a 9+ score: a slight repetition of "serenely electric" and the phrase "fantasy practicality" feels slightly summary-like. However, these do not obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story synthesizes its elements with remarkable originality and inevitability. The core concept of a "shard of hush" is a fresh, brilliant inversion of the search-for-a-signal trope. The combination of celestial mechanics and a Hollywood artifact feels organic and uniquely memorable, fully committing to its premise.</comment>
