<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in a desire for tranquility, and intensifies to compel her high-stakes dream-dive. Her interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("her breath pluming before her"). The final choice to craft a resolution dream is earned by prior causality—her discovery of the officer's true, heroic act. A micro-choice revealing her hierarchy of values is her decision to "expose the full truth... not to condemn him, but to absolve him."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal. Strong because/therefore linkages drive the plot: she analyzes dreams, therefore finds the officer, therefore uncovers the true memory, therefore crafts a resolution. The closure is a decisive change (the officer's spirit finds peace) with a clear, felt cost—the physical and emotional toll of her work is implied in the final image of her alone, holding the now-inert object. The persistent constraint of the ghost's unresolved shame shapes her tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and the melted snow globe are not just described but function as micro-settings that critically constrain choice and charge the final image. The shrine's "living" cold and "borrowed" light establish a tone that shifts to "earned" light at closure. The snow globe is the literal and thematic anchor of the entire narrative, its transformation from a "token of loss" to a "closed window" perfectly mirroring the internal resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the causal lens, escalation is driven by Elara's agency. The dominant stake (granting peace) is signaled early. A meaningful tightening occurs when she must "expose the full truth" to achieve absolution, a choice that narrows her options and raises the emotional cost. The price is legible in the final beat: the object becomes inert, and she is left alone, the work complete but the cost of the effort felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of salvaging pure intent from wreckage emerges entirely through events and the central image of the snow globe, never stated directly. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the "pure thing" salvaged is "his intent, his love, finally delivered." This reweights the prior material, transforming the globe from a metaphor of interruption to one of completed connection, embracing complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's perception, creating a distinct, lyrical texture ("the silent, crushing depths"). The prose's rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, becoming more visceral in the memory of the shipwreck. There is no head-hopping. The purposeful elision of how she precisely "finds the thread" of the daughter's dreams is taught by the story's established method and does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Sentences are propulsive and varied, doing multiple jobs (e.g., "a perfect, ruined metaphor for a life catastrophically interrupted" advances character, theme, and plot). There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final line is a masterful image that resolves the story's core motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diving and ghost-whispering through dream analysis is a highly original, non-obvious premise that feels organic and inevitable. The core concept is executed with full commitment to its emotional and logical implications. The specific, grounded choice of the melted snow globe transforms a common trope (unfinished business) into a singular and unforgettable story through unparalleled specificity.</comment>
