<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion under pressure. The final choice to release the story is earned by prior causality and the character's established motivation, with visible cost in the stomach knot and the absorption of experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density and a cadence shift at the climax. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the protagonist becomes a "keeper of their light," with cost legible in the transferred experience and the anchor finding its mooring.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The alchemist's market and the lighthouse lens fragment are micro-settings that actively pressure choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the POV's professional and personal priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, culminating in the decisive choice to "unfasten the truth." The cost is unmistakable as the woman's story—her fear and anguish—pours into the protagonist as a visceral experience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of honoring overlooked histories emerges organically from events and is resolved through a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image. The protagonist's internal arc is inextricable from this thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature. The prose has a controlled, purposeful rhythm and diction that modulates with emotional intensity. The elision of the actual words whispered is a taught pattern paid off by the experiential transfer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the peak beat ("an eternal instant, a sliver of time that stretched into infinity, yet was over in a heartbeat") which slightly slows momentum without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a translator of meanings and a magical object that reveals hidden histories is specific, non-obvious, and feels inevitable. The core premise is fully committed to and executed with a singular artistic stance, transforming its elements through grounded, lived detail.</comment>
