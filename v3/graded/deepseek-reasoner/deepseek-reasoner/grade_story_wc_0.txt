<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's characterization is precise and embodied, with a clear internal conflict between scientific detachment and emotional connection. Her micro-choice of peeling the wing reveals a shift, and her final realization feels earned by prior causality. A slight tendency toward diagnostic language in the climax ("a kindled humility") prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held perfectly, building to a resonant Conceptual Repricing at closure. The cost of her surrendered detachment is legible in the final image of her as "a element within it." Orientation is immediate and causality is flawless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse is a masterclass in micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Aris's professional bias. The silt and dust patterns are integral to the plot's turning point.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aris's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from data collection to humbled observation. The stake—processing grief—tightens through her discovery, and the cost of her changed worldview is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of silt and wing dust, culminating in a non-literal, resonant answer to the central question of loss and transformation. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, achieving profound emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature shaped by her scientific lexicon. The voice modulates under pressure without losing coherence. Purposeful elision (e.g., the grandmother's off-page presence) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is pattern-taught and paid off at closure. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts. Rhythm and syntax expertly modulate with the emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic and microscopic perspectives feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of gradual change is transformed through specific, grounded detail and a non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
