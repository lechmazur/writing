<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a specific, poetic worldview. Her sensitively perceptive trait is dramatized through concrete actions like tracing charred pages and hearing hollow resonance. The final choice to carry the legacy is earned by her prior engagement with the diaries. A slight telling of her feeling the "weight of his fear" prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; finding the negative reconfigures her purpose from mapping echoes to sharing a soul. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory and textual density. Causality is tight: the diaries directly lead to the acoustic clue and the discovery. The cost is legible in her acceptance of the burden to carry and share.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage and decaying hall are not just backdrop; they actively constrain and enable the search, pressuring the discovery. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional perception. The environment charges the final image, as the green light illuminates the negative, merging past and present.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification: the discovery of the diaries deepens the stake from professional duty to salvaging a legacy. This reweights the dominant stake with cost, foreclosing her initial goal. The only minor weakness is the slight convenience of the "sighing corner" clue being a direct cartographer's term she recognizes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully from the fusion of Elara's initial motivation and Lysander's act of preservation, answering what walls dream of. The final image of the negative—architecture interwoven with family—is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative. It avoids moralizing, offering a complex meditation on memory and legacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a perceptive, acoustic-focused lexicon. The prose has a distinct, measured rhythm suitable for the subject. The only very minor deduction is for a slight register consistency in the phrase "legacy's burden," which feels a touch more abstract than the surrounding concrete prose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and vivid, with high information density. Sentences are purposeful and advance character, atmosphere, and plot. Rhythm is controlled and varies effectively. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle are present, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core concept of an echo cartographer in a climate-shifted world is a fresh, brilliant synthesis. The fusion of acoustics and legacy feels organic and inevitable, not a checklist. The story commits fully to its premise, and the final reveal transforms the initial quirky motivation into profound, earned insight.</comment>
