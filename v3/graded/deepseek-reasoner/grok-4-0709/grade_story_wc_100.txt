<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's weariness and inadvertent stubbornness are embodied and consistent, compelling his higher-stakes choices. His motivation to "give rest a permanent address" is dramatized through concrete action, not told. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with the cost of exhaustion felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through density and cadence shifts. The closure is a resonant Earned Stasis, foreclosing a path with visible cost ("Exhausted but fulfilled"). The broken lens's transformation and the library's quietude land with undeniable conceptual and emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underwater library is a masterclass in micro-setting, actively pressuring choices and supplying the key resource (impossible spaces). The broken lighthouse lens constrains action and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and wholly integrated into the POV's perception and goal-directed action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens, with Elias's choice to enter the impossible spaces representing a decisive deepening. The cost is legible in his exhaustion and the mending of the lens. The dominant stake of spiritual rest is tested and earned through his stubborn persistence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of granting peace to the restless emerges organically from events and images, notably the transforming lens. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of profound stillness. It embraces complexity without moralizing, achieved through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature ("dim, watery glow," "pressurized silence"). The prose's rhythm and diction consistently reflect Elias's weary, determined state. Minor register drift ("inadvertently stubborn soul") is slight and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "chased stillness" is repeated, creating a slight paraphrase loop. However, this does not measurably obscure cause/effect or dull the powerful closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of an underwater undertaker, a broken lighthouse lens, and metaphysical spaces is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with high conceptual integrity, transforming its components into a singular, memorable vision.</comment>
