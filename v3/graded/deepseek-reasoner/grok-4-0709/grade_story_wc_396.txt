<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "map empathy onto action" is clear and compelling, rooted in her calmly intuitive nature and embodied through her use of shadows. Her final choice to act regardless of the Council's verdict is an Earned Stasis that feels earned by her prior micro-choices under pressure. A slight deduction for a moment of near-diagnostic language ("calmly intuited the root fear of scarcity") in a peak beat, though it is quickly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Charged Poise, reconfiguring options with undeniable cost as Elara descends armed with the orb. The inferred Causal lens holds tightly: her reconstitution acts directly because of the impending verdict, narrowing her options and changing her knowledge. The cost is legible in the final image of her "cloak of resolve" and the orchard's "nascent melt."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and ice floes are not just backdrop; they actively pressure Elara's choices, with the "shifting ice" and "groaning floes" mirroring the fractured clans. The vintage store mirrors are a micro-setting that constrains and enables the pivotal reconstitution action, charging the final image with their repurposed meaning from "warmer eras."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Causal lens: the weighted breath before the Council's reply tightens the timeframe, forcing her to act. Her reconstitution of the orb is a decisive deepening that changes her options, with the cost of foreclosing passive waiting legible on the page. A minor deduction for the Council's off-stage presence slightly diluting the immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of transforming empathy into action emerges organically from Elara's specific struggle, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the reconstituted orb—a "living map" of actionable strategies—that reweights the prior material without stating a thesis. The complexity of uniting fractured clans resists a tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture with a controlled rhythm that modulates with the scene's suspense. The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's perceptual signature, though a slight register drift into elevated diction ("nascent melt," "shadow-ink") in the final paragraph prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose is highly dense and purposeful, with sentences doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. Minor figurative strain in "apples frozen mid-bloom, as if holding their breath" slightly blurs the physical logic of the setting. Otherwise, the line-level craft is strong and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a glacial lighthouse orchard, a shadow-laced peacekeeper, and a crystal ball reconstitution through vintage mirrors is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of a "courageous anomaly" is transformed from a label into a specific, world-driven identity that shapes stakes and tactics on the page.</comment>
