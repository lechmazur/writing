<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling his interrogation. Mira's "patiently nimble" trait is shown through action ("fingers dancing lightly over ancient texts"). Their relationship forces choices that alter its state, and Elias's final understanding is earned. Minor deduction for a hint of diagnostic language in "mysterious familiarity" feeling slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds: Elias's curiosity leads to tea sessions, which escalate to the rooftop interrogation and closure. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. Closure is a decisive change (the building speaks) with felt cost ("their bond sealed forever"). The antique desk seal is a persistent constraint that shapes the final tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("vines that clung to weathered stone like possessive lovers"). The rooftop garden setting constrains the final choice by isolating them and amplifying the atmosphere. The building itself functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image with its audible hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from learning to uncovering truth, driven by Elias's agency in interrogating Mira. The rooftop setting and meteor shower apply coherent pressure, forcing her confession. The cost is legible in the building's groan and the sealed bond, foreclosing their previous dynamic of lies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the "agreed upon lies" concept, which is tested and reweighted at the end into a truth "born of fiction." The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, like Mira's "knowing smile."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Elias's perception. Prose has a distinct, lyrical texture ("eyes like forgotten scrolls"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though brief. Minor deduction for a slight convergence in voice at emotional peaks, but overall control is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without artifice. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("stars piercing the sky"). Rhythm varies effectively, accelerating during the interrogation. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Closure image is clear and impactful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise—learning the language of buildings through dead languages and shared lies—is highly original and fully committed to. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in blending realism and magical elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
