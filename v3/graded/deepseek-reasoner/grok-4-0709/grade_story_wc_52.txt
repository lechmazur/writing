<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is exceptional with embodied contradictions: her "borrowed coat" widowhood versus practical carving, trembling hands memory versus present courage. Micro-choices like tracing the wood and wielding the chisel reveal hierarchy of values. Final endurance feels earned through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong with pattern reinforcement ("here and gone," rain, steam). Closure achieves resonant reconfiguration through Charged Poise: the half-carved lion crystallizes time with cost legible in "eyes that seemed to watch her." Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: rain-beaded skylight mirrors emotional state, ash wood constrains choice through its "straight-grained" practicality, and kettle's steam triggers memory. The loft functions as micro-setting that charges the final image with "rust-hued peace." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation through accumulative density works well, though the kettle's timeframe could create tighter pressure. Dominant stake (harvesting peace from pain) deepens through carving beats. Cost is felt in the unfinished lion's gaze, but the temporal pressure remains slightly underutilized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through carving action and recurring motifs. The ending offers resonant non-literal answer: "here and gone, but harvested, held" without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like tracing wood and steam curls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature: "rust-hued peace," "earthly nostalgia." Voice modulates beautifully under pressure. No dialogue present, but internal voice maintains consistent texture and rhythm throughout emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exquisite with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor register drift in "earthly nostalgia" slightly elevates diction beyond POV's lexicon. No loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language consistently supports clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief through woodcarving metaphor feels inevitable. Specificity in ash wood properties and circus background avoids tropes. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
