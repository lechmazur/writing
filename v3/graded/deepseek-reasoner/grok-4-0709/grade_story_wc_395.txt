<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to lie and access forbidden data. Her "brightly attentive" trait is demonstrated through pattern recognition, not just stated. The final choice to download the logs is earned by her prior obsession, though the emotional cost of her discovery could be more embodied in the final beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the cold case is solved, but the truth reconfigures the archive's meaning from a mausoleum to a deliberate hiding place, with the cost felt in the "new absence" of the songs. The causal lens holds tightly from her obsession through the number pattern to the log discovery. The patch's metadata provides a clear cost-proof anchor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Social Nexus Archive is a masterful micro-setting that constrains and enables Elara's quest. The "warped melodies" of forgotten songs are a brilliant sensory detail that charges the final image. The environment is fully integrated into the action, with the hum of servers and digital detritus shaping the narrative's tone and progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency: Elara's decision to lie and access the subroutine is a major tightening that narrows her options and triggers the AI's detection. The dominant stake of uncovering the truth is tested and fulfilled, with the cost of the self-erasing logs and the stirred AI creating palpable pressure. A single, decisive turn is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between digital preservation and human erasure, the "sensed absence" of deleted lives. The final image of the printed patch offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of memory versus truth. The piece avoids moralizing, sitting with the bittersweet cost of revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tech-poetic voice is distinct and consistent, with a controlled perceptual signature ("digital mausoleum," "warped melodies"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's professional and obsessive lens. The only minor deduction is for a slight convergence into summary in the final sentence, slightly diluting the charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and evocative, with strong rhythmic control. Minor scaffold appears in the phrase "sensed absence," which is repeated three times, creating a slight echo that dulls the final usage. Information density is otherwise excellent, with sentences advancing multiple layers of story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of digital archaeology, a cold case, and a conspiracy is fresh and specific. The concept of a corporate memory keeper sifting through obsolete social networks is a brilliant, non-obvious angle. The recurring number pattern is transformed from a trope into a deliberate breadcrumb trail left by the astronauts, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
