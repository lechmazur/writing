<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in a compelling trait (filtering reality), but the survivor's agency is largely observational. The final endurance is earned, yet the lack of a micro-choice under peak pressure prevents a higher score. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where nameless identity becomes a strength. Cost is legible in the final reflection, though the felt price of the transformation is somewhat conceptual rather than visceral. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The shipping container labyrinth is a masterful micro-setting that actively pressures choices (e.g., climbing to evade high tide) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully filtered through the POV's unique perception, with the tides and containers constraining action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation occurs through the accumulative lens via density increase. However, the protagonist's agency is passive (collecting, listening), lacking a decisive on-page choice that narrows options or pays a sharp, visible cost. The gentle deepening fits the mode but limits tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories and identity emerges organically through collected fragments and the poison label's discovery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"nameless yet textured"—without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the object's reweighting and the survivor's filtered perception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature ("colors bled into sounds"). The prose's lyrical density is mostly controlled and voice-motivated, though some phrases risk opacity ("filtered the words into a personal prism"). No head-hopping; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but figurative language occasionally stacks ("veils of what-ifs and half-remembered echoes") creating minor momentum drag. No critical artifacts obscure closure, and rhythm supports the accumulative mode. A single paraphrase loop noted ("histories erased" appears twice nearby).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Premise is highly original, synthesizing a bureaucratic error with a sensory-filtering consciousness in a specific, lived-in world. The core concept of collecting erased histories feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, though the passive protagonist slightly limits ingenuity.</comment>
