<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with her technical gentleness embodied in precise actions like "untwisting strands that had stiffened with age and frost." Her emotional progression from guilt to resolve feels earned, and micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation carries visible cost in her tears, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with closure achieved through resonant reconfiguration as the rope's vibrations release the names. Orientation is immediate, and cost is legible in "Elara wept, her technically gentle hands pressing to her chest." The persistent constraint of the ceremonial rope shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum actively constrains choice through its frozen environment, while the ceremonial rope charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's expertise. The setting evolves causally with the aurora's intensification, satisfying the 9+ test through environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, with the stakes of preserving names tightening through her precise reconfiguration work. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional release and physical warmth that emerges. The dominant stake is signaled early and pays off with visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete actions and images rather than statement, with the final image of names echoing eternally offering a resonant, non-literal answer to preservation against oblivion. The piece avoids moralizing while embracing complexity through specific particulars like the transcribed memory concept.</comment>

The voice maintains coherence under pressure, with any elision taught early through the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally exquisite with high information density, though slight overwriting appears in peak beats like "snowmelt ardor infused her actions" which feels slightly redundant. Rhythm and sentence variety support the accumulative progression effectively, with clear propulsion toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of technical craft (lost wax casting) with emotional heritage preservation feels fresh and inevitable. The ceremonial rope and punched card create a non-obvious combination that heightens stakes.
