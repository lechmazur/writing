<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elowen's motivation to articulate unspoken needs is clear and drives the central action, compelling his high-stakes choice to encode the graffiti. His interiority is concrete and character-particular, shown through his digital essence and spectral nature. The late introduction of Lira is functional but prevents deeper relationship dynamics from developing on the page, though her kinship feels earned. The final renunciation of his trapped state is motivated by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (Elowen's code unraveling, his form materializing) with clear, felt cost—his songs are freed to be heard. The causal lens holds strongly: his encoding action directly leads to Lira's intervention and his release. The timeframe between lightning and thunder provides coherent pressure that tightens options. Orientation is anchored early with who, where, and when clearly established.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The misty courtyard and weather machine are vividly rendered and integral to the plot, constraining Elowen's choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elowen's spectral POV. The flower press bolt plate functions as a micro-setting, its specific mechanics crucial to the encoding action and resolution. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom/connection) is signaled early and escalates under causal pressure through the tightening timeframe. Elowen's agency in encoding the message drives the escalation, narrowing his options before the storm breaks. The cost is legible in the imminent thunder threat and his digital essence being poured into the art. Resolution is earned by his prior action and Lira's decoding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken needs finding voice emerges organically through the concrete action of encoding graffiti, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the promise of future stories, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in the encoded messages and the shared wonder between Elowen and Lira. Avoids moralizing or thematic summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Elowen's spectral, coded perception coloring the narration ("digital veins," "coded form"). Voice has a distinct tinkersong wonder texture in word choice and rhythm. The patterned elision of his ghost-in-code nature is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and propulsive with high information density. Minor artifacting appears in some adjective stacks ("driftingly alert gaze," "tinkersong wonder") which slightly inflate texture without advancing sense. However, clarity remains strong, especially in peak beats, and sentence-level rhythm supports the scene's urgency. No loops or scaffold issues obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost, code, weather machine, and graffiti art feels fresh and organic, not checklist-driven. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on spectral narratives, transformed through specific world logic. The flower press bolt plate is a particularly ingenious, irreplaceable object. Risk-taking in the hybrid concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
