<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final identity crystallization is earned by prior causality with visible cost. A slight deduction for minor diagnostic self-awareness ("preemptively nostalgic" feels slightly articulated).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost felt in the final image of emerging identities defying the hush. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through density and pattern. A minor orientation delay in the first paragraph caps the score slightly below 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The forecourt's crystals and monuments are tactile resources that shape tactics. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully woven through action, reflecting the POV's professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with pressure building through the storm's intensity and memory revelations. The cost of isolation and fractured identity is legible. A single meaningful tightening (the storm's peak) is sufficient for this length, though the escalation is more atmospheric than causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between collective memory and individual identity. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of sculpted identities defying the hush. It embraces complexity without moralizing, though the concept of "preemptive nostalgia" is occasionally stated rather than fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature. The prose has a controlled, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful elision (e.g., the exact mechanics of conjecture) is taught and pays off, contributing to the closure's legibility without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences describing shadow measurement, causing a slight deduction, but clarity at closure is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh synthesis of memory, identity, and isolation. The stormlit observatory and crystal forecourt are highly specific and irreplaceable. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
