<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and goal-driven, though her interiority remains somewhat functional. Thorne is vividly drawn; his involuntary truthfulness is a compelling trait, but its constraint on his choices is shown more than felt in the pivotal reveal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly. The closure is a decisive change (lights return) with clear on-page cost (the expended wonder). The riddle provides a motivated ellipsis that narrows options effectively, and the final beat reconfigures the city's relationship with routine magic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lightning tower and lacquer box are not just vivid backdrops but essential, constraining elements that charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, fully integrated into action and perfectly mirroring the story's tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (blackout). Escalation is driven by the riddle, a meaningful tightening that narrows Elara's options. The cost—expending the stored wonder—is legible and alters the final state, though the agency in solving the riddle is slightly straightforward.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of wonder in the mundane emerges organically through the specific failure of the engineered system and is resolved by a return to a foundational, almost mythical, artifact. The final image of "routine resumed—but now, laced with enduring awe" offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and effective. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates well with the story's magical realism. The single instance of dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though Thorne's speech slightly converges with the narrative voice at peak intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush and rhythmic with high information density. Minor deduct for the slightly repetitive use of "nectar dusk" and a single instance of near-paraphrase ("wonder leeched from the everyday miracle"). Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and clear, with no artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of bio-mechanical bees, a truth-curse, and a lightning-harvesting tower is fresh and organic. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic, avoiding cliché.</comment>
