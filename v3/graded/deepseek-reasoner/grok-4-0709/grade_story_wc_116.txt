<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation is clear and consistent, compelling his high-stakes choice to observe. However, interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; his witnessing is a singular, unwavering drive without internal friction, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in the keeper's cyclical return, reinforcing his purpose. The inferred Accumulative lens holds, with pressure deepening through observed cycles. A minor deduction for the portal method feeling slightly convenient rather than fully integrated into the established textural pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is exceptional and indispensable. The library and refuge are not just backdrops but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's perception and the story's thematic logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a cadence shift and density increase in the observed cycles. However, the pressure is largely observational; the protagonist's agency in escalating the central stake of witnessing is passive, relying on the portal's function rather than a active, difficult choice under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully from the keeper's actions and the recurring images of silence and observation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of witnessing change. A slight deduction for the final line ("endless, impartial dance") which edges toward stating the thematic thesis rather than fully trusting the scene's resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, consistent texture with controlled, purposeful diction. The prose effectively reflects the keeper's perceptual signature. Minor filter verbs ("he felt," "he knew") slightly dull immediacy in a few spots, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density, rhythmic control, and zero artifacts that obscure cause/effect. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, supporting the atmosphere without muddle. One minor paraphrase loop ("drift of untold seasons" repeated) is a hairline slip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a silent chronicler, a regenerative library, and a folding-paper portal feels fresh, organic, and inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully committed to and executed with a singular artistic vision, transforming its components into a specific and memorable whole.</comment>
