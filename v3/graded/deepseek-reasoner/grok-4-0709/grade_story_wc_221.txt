<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices (sketching, adjusting position) revealing her values. The final renunciation of isolation for exploration is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her transformed stance. Contradictory impulses of fear and curiosity act simultaneously in scene, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, with pattern break (sketching revealing new constellations) leading to resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost in her decision to venture deeper, charged by the pulsating nebula image. Orientation is clear by paragraph 2, and the final image reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The time dilation deck constrains choice (temporal perception altering sketching pace) and charges the final image (warped stars revealing nebula). Sensory details are selective and purposeful (echoed silence, creaking metal), filtered through Elara's perceptual bias. The deck functions as micro-setting that actively shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under accumulative lens: sketching deepens knowledge, leading to the glimpse that reweights stakes. Cost is legible in her transformed motivation and decision to explore archives. One meaningful tightening (nebula discovery) forecloses passive isolation, with visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the compass rose and sketching custom, with the ending offering a non-literal answer to finding direction. Subtext operates in the pulsating nebula and whispered secrets, resisting moralizing. The final image reweights prior material without statement, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control under pressure ("elongated threads" of time). POV is stable and voice-consistent, with purposeful compression (temporal stretches). No head-hopping; elision (crew's absence) is taught and paid off in closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught ("echoed silence") and pays off. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with scene needs, avoiding template cadence. Minor register drift in "stellar tomb" is voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of time dilation and familial tradition feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals (compass rose irreplaceable). Transforms tropes through grounded character choices.</comment>
