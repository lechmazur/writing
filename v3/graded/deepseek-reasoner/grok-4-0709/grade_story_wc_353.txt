<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in the silent world's condition. Her symphonically minded nature is not just a label but actively shapes her perception and method, culminating in an earned moment of creation. The final choice to continue her work feels motivated by the success of her empathy-driven strumming. A slight deduction for the hedgehog's reaction feeling slightly decorative rather than crucible-like.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), with the grove's silence enriched rather than broken, reconfiguring the stakes with a felt cost of her ongoing commitment. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory and emotional density. The cost is legible in her tears and the knowledge her work has "just begun." A minor deduction for a slight causality break: the method of "analyzing stress cracks" is stated but its on-page execution is more intuitive than analytical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exquisitely rendered and far from generic. It is deeply integrated into the action and thematically resonant. The porcelain insulator, a micro-setting object, crucially constrains the choice (her method of analysis and strumming) and decisively charges the final image as the resonating heart of the sculpture. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and beautifully filtered through Elara's unique perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive cadence shift from searching to discovery to successful creation. The dominant stake (rekindling connection) is meaningfully deepened. The cost is the emotional weight of the world's silence and her renewed commitment to a vast task. Agency is clear in her active strumming and analysis. The pressure feels coherent, though the initial discovery of the sculpture carries a faint whiff of convenience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "empathy in motion" and the specific struggle to create music. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—connection is rebuilt through shared rhythm and understanding, not loud proclamation. The piece avoids moralizing, with the final image of the content hedgehog and flying siskins providing a subtle, earned emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly matched to the protagonist's symphonically minded nature. POV is stable and deeply immersive. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic quality that modulates with the emotional intensity of the scene. Purposeful compression (e.g., the cataclysm's backstory) is effective and maintains momentum. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly textured but generally maintains clarity and momentum. There is a high degree of figurative language, but it is mostly coherent and pattern-taught by the voice. A minor deduction for a slight "scaffold" moment in the climax: "slow builds for the deep fractures, quick flutters for the fine lines" feels slightly explanatory within an otherwise embodied action. Rhythm and syntax are otherwise expertly controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core premise of a "tree-song sculptor" in a silent world is fresh and compelling. The combination of elements (porcelain insulator, stress cracks as notation) feels organic and specific, not checklist-driven. The story commits fully to its lyrical, accumulative mode. It avoids cliché through its particular voice and perspective. A minor cap is applied as the high-band gate requires Q2 ≥ 9.0, which was not met.</comment>
