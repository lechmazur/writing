<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's logical yet perceptive nature is consistently embodied, driving her micro-choices under pressure, such as switching to tactile memory. Her final self-image shift from indexer to guardian is earned by the discovery's cost. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic feel in "tranquilly perceptive nature absorbed this."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong causal drive lens: the blackout forces a tactical shift, and her alternative hypothesis leads directly to the vault discovery. Closure is a decisive change (CR) with felt cost: her reconfigured identity and the city's submerged truth. The lens holds without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sunken library is a pressurized, tactile environment that constrains choice (sealed locks, vault door ajar) and charges the final image (secrets surfaced). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional focus, like the bioluminescent algae and the cold floor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (truth vs. false narrative) are clear early. Pressure escalates causally: the blackout forces a method change, and the tremor opens the vault. Her agency—pursuing the alternative hypothesis—drives the escalation and leads to the closure with a clear cost (reconfigured identity).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reclaimed history emerges through action and image, not statement. The final realization about refugees sinking the city for peace is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise. Avoids moralizing, though the core concept ("reclaimed stillness") is slightly more stated than fully integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, analytical voice that modulates under pressure. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic quality. Elision (abandoning the digital indexer) is taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with good rhythm. Minor artifact: "tranquilly perceptive" edges toward label-speak. A slight paraphrase loop occurs with "reclaimed stillness" and its variants. However, these do not significantly obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sunken library, a logical indexer, and a seismic blackout feels organic and fresh. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. The final reconfiguration of the city's origin story is a non-obvious, earned inflection.</comment>
