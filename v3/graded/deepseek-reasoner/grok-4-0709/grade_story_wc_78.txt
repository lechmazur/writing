<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prophet's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in a specific philosophy ("turn obstacles into instruments"). His actions are consistent and his final endurance is earned, though interior contradiction under peak stress could be more dramatized. The felt cost of his effort is visible in his lowered mallet and the peaceful resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a visible, felt cost of expended effort. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure escalating through the deepening blue hour and fractal patterns multiplying. The cost is legible in the final image of the prophet lowering his mallet in exhaustion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally vivid and integral, constraining every choice. The floating orchard is not a backdrop but the central instrument of survival. The driftwood, trees, and sea are tactile and purposefully woven into the action, directly charging the final image of the harmonized tide.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the prophet's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the blue hour and fractal clouds providing coherent, intensifying pressure. The cost is unmistakable: his ritual is a direct, on-page response to the imminent threat, and his success is earned through his composed action, transforming the tide's threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of transforming chaos into harmony emerges organically from the prophet's specific actions and the core concept of sketched resonance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the entire struggle into a performance. The integration is seamless and profound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a lyrical, rhythmic quality that mirrors the euphonious tone. The prose effectively reflects the prophet's perception, though there is a slight convergence into a more elevated register at the peak that, while fitting, slightly softens the character's particular voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is lush and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic propulsion and vivid imagery. There is minor density in the figurative language, but it serves the accumulative, pattern-based design and does not obscure closure. The final sentences achieve a clean, resonant cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core premise is highly original and executed with bold commitment. The synthesis of a floating orchard, a tide prophet, and fractal music is a fresh, non-obvious angle that feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking with the accumulative structure and lyrical prose heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
