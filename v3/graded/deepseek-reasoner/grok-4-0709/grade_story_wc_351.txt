<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies, with strong interiority and embodied emotion. The final transformation is earned by prior causality, though the embodiment of stress could be more tactile in peak moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) with a legible conceptual cost. A clear causal lens holds throughout, with a persistent constraint (the mirror) shaping the final image. The seismic quakes feel slightly under-integrated into the causal chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The canyon and mirror are vividly rendered and purposefully selective. The mirror charges the final image, but the canyon's role is more atmospheric than constraining, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with a clear stake and a meaningful tightening through his mental modifications. The cost, however, is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page in the final beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically from the central metaphor of the helix and archeology, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a strong perceptual signature. The prose is controlled, though a few complex sentences in high-pressure moments slightly obscure immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful with strong rhythm, but occasional overwriting and a complex syntax create minor momentum drag in a few key beats, though clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of neural tech, memory archaeology, and a broken mirror is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The premise is fully committed to and executed with specific, grounded detail.</comment>
