<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in his lineage, compelling his high-stakes choice to confess. His internal conflict is embodied through concrete actions like tracing door scuffs, though his emotional state occasionally borders on summary ("inherited doubt"). The final renunciation feels earned, with visible cost in the ghosts fading and his father's shadow lifting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, achieved through Elias's confession that integrates his truth with the ghosts', reconfiguring his peace with a felt cost. The lens holds perfectly from the dense opening imagery to the charged final repose. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison is vividly rendered and pressures choices, but its greatest strength is the micro-setting of the confessional lattice, which constrains the climactic choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though the environment's effect on tactics is more atmospheric than physically constraining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift at the confession, reweighting the dominant stake of authenticity with a clear cost—the ghosts' absolution and Elias's earned calm. The tightening is driven by his agency, though the external time pressure ("before they find the bodies") is less active than the internal drive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of truth and legacy, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the image of ghosts fading into light. The lattice and copperlight motifs are charged with meaning without moralizing, and the ending embraces complexity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature ("copperlight repose") and rhythmic prose that modulates with emotional intensity. Occasional register drift near peaks ("inherited doubt") slightly dulls immediacy, but the elision of ghost dialogue is purposeful and pays off in the accumulative closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though it occasionally flirts with overwriting in peak beats ("copperlight repose of a fading sunset"). A minor template cadence occurs with "chase hush" repetitions, but clarity and momentum are maintained, and the closure image is undimmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes the "boy who cried wolf" myth with a Gothic prison setting in a fresh, inevitable way. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and lyric prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the integration of legacy, truth, and ghosts feels singular and fully committed.</comment>
