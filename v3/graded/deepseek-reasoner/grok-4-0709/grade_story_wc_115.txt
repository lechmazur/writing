<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("drowsy fog clouding his thoughts while alertness prickled his skin"). The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, though the "reckless" trait is more stated than actively demonstrated in on-page choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (CR) that reprices the premise with conceptual cost, landing on the page with the image of washing away dust and burden. Causal lens holds tightly from confession to discovery. Orientation is immediate and the final cost is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV. The tunnel pressures the choice, though the beaded valve wheel functions more as a symbolic key than a constraint that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens: the radio calls and ghost manifestation force a reinterpretation that narrows options. The cost is legible in the final release of water and burden. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the ghost shift concept and the father's secret, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the conceptual repricing of disappearance as escape. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a strong perceptual signature. Some minor register drift occurs in peak beats ("drowsy alertness" becomes a slightly repetitive motif), but elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("drowsy alertness" repeated) and a slight template cadence in describing the valve wheel, but these do not obscure closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of the ghost shift concept with a personal swallowed truth feels fresh and inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and theme, committing fully to its implications.</comment>
