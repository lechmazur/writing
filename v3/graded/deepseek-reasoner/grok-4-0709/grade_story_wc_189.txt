<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to "discover the texture of time" is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling his oblique approach. His warmly observant trait is embodied in micro-choices like placing the cicada and remains consistent. Elara's internal conflict is more summarized than dramatized in simultaneous contradiction, holding the score below the 9-band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in Kael's final line and the exchanged cicada. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with escalation through density increase and a cadence shift that reweights the stake. A slight ambiguity in lens clarity at the midpoint prevents a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The grotto and tidal pool are intensely specific and pressure choices, most notably when Kael uses the pool's edge to place the cicada. The jade cicada itself functions as a micro-setting, constraining his action and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through his chronicler's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake (closure/transition) is signaled early. Escalation occurs through a cadence shift in the prolonged pause, reweighting the stake under the accumulative lens. However, the pressure feels more atmospheric than actively driven by protagonist agency, as Kael's observational stance is largely passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the tidal pool and cicada, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of transition. The final image of the grotto "whispering of change's inevitable, beautiful flow" reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with a strong perceptual signature. The narrative voice is consistent, though it risks overwriting in high-pressure beats ("vast and uncharted," "pregnant with unspoken fears"). No head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally purposeful, but figurative language is dense in the opening beats, creating minor momentum drag. The line "silence bloomed, vast and uncharted" is a mixed metaphor. No loops or scaffolding, and the closure beat is clear and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal-pool chronicling, a jade cicada, and a thematic focus on transition periods feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The specific, grounded choices in character and world avoid tropiness. The tangential method of foresight is a non-obvious, ingenious risk that pays off.</comment>
