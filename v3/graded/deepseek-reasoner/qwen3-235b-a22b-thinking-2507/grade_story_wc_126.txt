<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (unbinding the violin) revealing a clear hierarchy of values. Her final choice is earned by prior causality, though a minor vagueness in the family tradition's mechanics prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) landing on the page with felt cost ("the beauty wasn’t in the sound alone, but in the space it left behind"). The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, with a persistent constraint (the warped violin) shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse is not merely described; it actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The setting is a character, with sensory detail purposefully filtered through Elara's acoustically perceptive POV to create a palpable atmosphere of loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the humming bowl deepening her knowledge and compelling the choice to play. The cost is legible in the warped instrument's protest and the transformation of the hush, though the initial trigger (the bowl's hum) is slightly passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of finding beauty in the unfinished emerges organically from events and the final image, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material ("the unfinished became whole in its incompleteness") with profound simplicity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The POV exhibits a distinct perceptual signature, with syntax and rhythm perfectly reflecting Elara's acoustic perception. The voice is controlled and consistent under pressure, with any elision (the fires) taught and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits exceptional density and rhythmic control, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("a cathedral of loss"), and sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing in step with the scene's needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-apocalyptic setting with a musician's acoustic perception feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to, with specific, grounded choices in character and world that avoid cliché and heighten stakes.</comment>
