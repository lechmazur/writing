<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, compelling higher-stakes choices. Her internal conflict between honoring and evolving tradition is embodied and concrete, shown through micro-choices like retrieving the kite. The final renunciation of passive waiting is earned by prior causality, though her competence slightly edges into flaw-masking during the decoding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (elders' disapproval, land's pain alleviated) under a causal lens. The kite's discovery is a motivated ellipsis that tightens options, and the final image of the hybrid plant reconfigures the valley's future. Orientation is anchored early; linkage is strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The hot springs setting constrains choice (heat intensification guiding her to the vent) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's urgency and connection to the land. The environment evolves causally with the unsealing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens: her decision to retrieve and decode the kite narrows options and leads to the unsealing. The cost is legible in the land's prior pain and the defiance of tradition. One meaningful tightening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images (kite script, hybrid plant) without direct statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer to tradition vs. evolution, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in plant whispers and symbolic transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward plant communication and geological detail. Syntax and rhythm reflect Elara's age and urgency. No dialogue, but internal voice is coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("spectral hands") is pattern-taught and pays off. Rhythm varies naturally with sentence length, accelerating toward climax. Minor overwriting in peak beats does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis of eco-fiction and prophecy tropes through specific, grounded choices. The hybrid plant outcome feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in blending spiritual and ecological elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
