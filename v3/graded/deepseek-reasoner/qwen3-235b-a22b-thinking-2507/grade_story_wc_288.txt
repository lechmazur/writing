<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and contradictory, with embodied emotion ("screamed until her throat bled"). Her micro-choice to use the Resonance is motivated by a credible struggle between drowning in memory and seeking independence. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her tears and reconfigured stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density and memory shards until the cadence shift at the stone circle. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara reconfigures her relationship to loss, with cost legible in "Tears streamed as she understood." Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tidal library and stone circle are not just vivid but constrain choice and charge the final image. The dome's apex focuses light for the climax; the hum transforms pain. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, woven through action ("seawater surged through hidden channels").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification: the sundial's interaction with dawn light and the hum's swelling reweight the stake of carrying memory. Protagonist agency drives the choice to kneel and align, and the cost is felt in the threat to sanity and the eventual tearful resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the Aethon's dissolution, the hum's purpose, and Elara's tears crystallize the idea that independence is coexistence with loss. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like "shards of ice in her blood."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that filters setting through memory and urgency. Diction remains within Elara's lexicon even under pressure. The prose has rhythmic control, and elision (e.g., the Great Silence's cause) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language ("clouds swirled like restless oceans") is pattern-taught and supports pressure. Minor artifact: "atomically reflective" slightly disrupts register but is quickly grounded in function. No loops or scaffold issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal library, extinct species, and reincarnation memory feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "brittle awakenings" transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
