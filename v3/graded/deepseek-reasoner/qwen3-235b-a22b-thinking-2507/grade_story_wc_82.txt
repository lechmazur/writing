<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is profoundly embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (polishing the geode despite pain) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her internal contradiction—"descends while ascending"—is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost scalding her cheeks. Slight deduction for Kael's spirit detachment feeling slightly abstract, a backstory element not fully embodied on-page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of grief/work intensifies to a cadence shift at closure. Orientation is immediate ("floating island tea garden"). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she turns toward the next geode, with cost felt in her "rising—not above the pain, but through it." One meaningful tightening occurs when polishing activates the dream sensation, forcing her to continue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The glass basilica and geode constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("mist curling like smoke above jade ponds"). Setting is woven through action (the climb, the workbench). The floating isle's serenity tensions internal grief, and the basilica's light acts as "luminous torment," flaying her open.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: her decision to polish the geode deepens the stake from passive folding to active transformation. Cost is legible as she is "carved apart" by the process. One meaningful intensification suffices. Minor deduction: the shadow's detachment is backstory, not on-page pressure, slightly diluting immediate escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: love and loss as the "same spectrum" is realized through the polished gem transforming agony into a vessel for both sorrow and solace. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"folded hope"—without moralizing. The final image of turning toward another geode reweights prior material with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control ("Descends while ascending—that was her existence now"). POV is stable and deeply internal. Figurative language is voice-motivated and pattern-taught ("luminous torment"). No dialogue, but internal free indirect style is clean and legible. Elision (shadow detachment) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional prose with high information density and zero artifacts. Sentences advance story and atmosphere ("Sunlight bled through stained glass, painting the stairs in liquid gold, yet the light felt like knives"). Rhythm varies naturally with pressure. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is coherent and heightens closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief-work through dream recording and origami. The floating isle and glass basilica are organically integrated, not checklist items. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation of grief into light feels inevitable and earned.</comment>
