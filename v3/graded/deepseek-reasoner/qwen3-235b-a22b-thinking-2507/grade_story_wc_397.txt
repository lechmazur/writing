<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation evolves from seeking death to understanding endings with credible irrationality. Her embodied perception ("world blurred like watercolor") and the parasol-tip memory reveal character under pressure. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, though the epiphany's diagnostic language ("fold in patience wasn't a breaking point") slightly hedges peak emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory details (wind, ice sounds) build to a Conceptual Repricing closure. The parasol discovery triggers a causal micro-turn (vision, ice crack), culminating in her reconfigured understanding. Cost is legible in the near-miss and the final image of "distant release." Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina constrains choice (trawling on ice) and charges the closure (calving sound). Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("wind's sigh", "shovel's scrape"). The parasol tip functions as micro-setting, triggering memory and reweighting the ending. Specificity avoids cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning endings) escalates under Accumulative lens through density increases (parasol discovery, ice crack). Protagonist agency drives tightening—her trawling directly causes the crisis and revelation. Cost is visible in the fissure racing beneath her and the foreclosed path of mere waiting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (parasol, ice groans) without statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer: endings are "woven into waiting." Subtext operates in image and sound ("windborne solace"). Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, embracing complexity in the final grace note.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("ghost of failed euthanasia"). Syntax reflects mental state—compressed under stress, expansive in reflection. No dialogue. Purposeful elision (euthanasia attempt) is taught and paid off. Internal voice remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without artifacts. Figurative language is pattern-taught ("windborne solace") and pays off at closure. Sentences vary structure to match urgency. No loops or scaffolding. Peak beats maintain clarity despite lyrical density ("high, pure vibration in the ice").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Premise is fresh: euthanasia survivor seeking the "sound of endings" in Arctic disaster relief. Specific synthesis (parasol heirloom, ice imagery) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transforms familiar themes through grounded particulars.</comment>
