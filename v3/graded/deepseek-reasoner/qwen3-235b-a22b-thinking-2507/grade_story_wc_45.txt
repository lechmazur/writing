<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara’s characterization is deeply embodied and contradictory, with skepticism and wonder coexisting in her micro-choices. Her motivation crystallizes through specific, costly action—repurposing the tooth—and her final choice to teach others is earned by prior causality. The only minor flaw is a slight telling in "disarmed her bitterness," but this does not touch the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara’s stance crystallizes into a new purpose, with cost legible in the final image of planting seeds in the cleft’s shadow. The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building through reflective density and image patterns that tighten toward the ending. All orientation is clear by the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The garden, tooth, and splint function as micro-settings that actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara’s perception. The sundial and well are integrated into action, and the spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is a deepening through reflective density and the bone-setting analogy, which reweights the dominant stake of healing. Protagonist agency drives the turn, and cost is legible in the final commitment to forge pain into light. One meaningful intensification is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the bone-setting metaphor and the repurposed tooth, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to healing and forgiveness. No moralizing or thematic echo; the final image of "planting seeds in its shadow" is earned through particulars and carries complex ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, reflective voice that modulates under pressure. Diction remains within Elara’s lexicon, and the prose has a strong perceptual signature. The only minor flaw is a single filter verb ("she thought") in a high-pressure beat, but it is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences doing multiple jobs. A minor scaffold phrase ("exactly, she thought") appears once, but it does not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image. No figurative muddle or register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story transforms the changeling trope through specific psychological depth and the bone-setting metaphor, creating a fresh, inevitable synthesis. Risk-taking in reflective density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The integration of folklore and emotional truth feels singular and authentic.</comment>
