<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's characterization is exceptional, with his "shrewdly innocent" trait embodied in his decryption of the cast. His final choice to reshape the symbol and gift the coral is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his tightened throat and the pulse beneath his bandage. His internal contradiction—translator's guilt versus healer's purpose—acts simultaneously in the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as shared anxieties are braided into "something quieter, stronger," reconfiguring meaning with undeniable cost felt in Aris's physical transformation. The final image of the cast "carrying not just a message but a new truth" lands with profound conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and brain coral fragment are indispensable micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. The coral's "intricate channels" are used to decrypt the cast, and its gift reweights the entire narrative. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and wholly integrated into action and perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aris's agency under the Accumulative lens. The dominant stake (translating pain into understanding) tightens through the decryption beat, which narrows his options and forces the consequential choice to reshape the symbol. The cost is legible in his throat tightening and the final, felt pulse of his wound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of translating trauma into testimony is masterfully integrated, emerging from the coral's transformation and the act of decryption. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"wounds could hold life"—that reweights all prior material without moralizing. The final image of meaning taking root is profoundly earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical signature. The prose rhythm modulates beautifully with emotional intensity, particularly in the decryption passage. The single line of dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and perfectly pitched in the child's dialect, carrying immense subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion. A minor deduction for the slightly ornamental phrase "lotus-hearted ache," which, while thematically consistent, edges toward decorative metaphor in a peak beat. Otherwise, the line-level craft is flawless and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a conflict-zone translator, a brain coral, and a child's encrypted cast is brilliantly original and feels inevitable. The core concept of "shared anxieties" is transformed from abstraction into a tangible, braided connection. The risk-taking with dense, lyrical prose heightens stakes and coherence perfectly.</comment>
