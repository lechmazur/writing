<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, rooted in grief and a desperate hunt for meaning, intensifying under pressure. Embodied emotion is strong (e.g., "knuckles white," "tears evaporating in the geode’s warmth"). The final choice to map the pools is a credible endurance/renunciation, though the transition from grief to exhilaration is slightly abrupt, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Aris redefines his hunt, landing with cost ("bleak exhilaration," the fragile vessel of hope). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory and emotional density. The geode's flare memory pays off, and the cost is legible in the final image of the map and the void.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The observatory and gas giant are vividly rendered and pressure choices through system constraints (cooling breakers, sensor array). The geode, a micro-setting object, crucially constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Aris's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: Aris's decision to rerun the perturbation sequence on the geode's signature is a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge. The cost is legible in the intertwined grief and exhilaration of the climax. A single, powerful pressure point is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of astrophysics and raw emotion, resisting tidy morals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: hope is not reclaimed but mapped in the voids where potential pools. The final image of the map and the pulsing geode reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, scientific voice that modulates under emotional pressure. The prose has a strong rhythmic control, though there is a minor register drift in the phrase "intangibly tangible joy," which feels slightly elevated for the narrator's lexicon in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. However, minor figurative overwriting occurs in the climax ("intangibly tangible presence," a slightly mixed metaphor) and the phrase "intangibly tangible joy" creates a small artifact, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of hard sci-fi (perturbation theory) with profound emotional loss is fresh and specific. The core premise is fully committed to and followed through to its implications. The geode as a scientific and emotional object is a singular, irreplaceable choice that heightens stakes.</comment>
