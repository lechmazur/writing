<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in her profession and a deeper philosophical drive ("modeling resilient communities from ruins"). Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, shown through tactile interactions with the environment. The final choice to reroute power is earned by her established "functionally creative" nature and prior sketches. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward diagnostic label-speak ("stoic wonder").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Causal drive lens holds firmly: each action (finding the sextant, aligning it, bypassing fuses) leads logically to the next, culminating in the terminal's reactivation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing in the final image of the terminal "humming with latent potential" and Elara's vision of a "blueprint for hope." The cost is the tangible effort and the weight of ambition she shoulders.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, perfectly filtered through Elara's professional POV ("corroded control panel," "scent of ozone and stale popcorn"). The setting actively pressures her choices and supplies the key resources (sextant, junction box, geothermal energy). It narrowly misses the 9+ gate as the environment, while evocative, doesn't *constrain* a choice as much as enable her solution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Causal lens. The dominant stake (resurrecting the terminal's core functions) is signaled early and tightens through her physical and intellectual labor. The cost is the visible effort and risk ("Sparks hissed... her hands steady despite the dust") and the conceptual price of transforming a "tomb of ambition" into a functional hub.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central action of repurposing decay into innovation ("turning entropy into order"). The core concept of a "maze of intentions" is transformed into a "unified purpose: survival" through Elara's work. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "Hope was a flow, and she had learned to redirect it," avoiding moralizing and growing from the story's particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Elara's engineer's perception, with a distinct perceptual signature ("envisioning currents as rivers seeking new courses"). The prose has a controlled, purposeful texture. A minor, hairline slip occurs with a slight register elevation in the final paragraphs ("stoic wonder," "profound peace"), but it remains legible and does not break voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. A single, minor artifact is detected: a near-paraphrase loop between "redirecting what remained toward what could be" and the earlier concept of "redirected flows," which slightly dulls the final image's edge. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are superb.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of the "engineer in a fallen world" trope through its specific focus on infrastructure renewal and celestial navigation as a metaphor for energy redirection. The combination of the abandoned carnival and spaceport is singular and purposeful. The core concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and the risk-taking with a quiet, technical climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
