<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's characterization is deeply embodied and particular, with his internal conflict (guilt vs. duty) acting simultaneously in scene. His final choice to untether Vanya is earned by prior causality, with the drawer pull serving as a tangible anchor to his flaw and its cost. The trait "uncommonly thoughtful" is demonstrated through his quiet calculus, not merely stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, landing with undeniable cost on the page: "the fragile, hard-won space where apology ended and forgiveness might yet begin." The moon-phase method and neutral territory are persistent constraints that shape tactics, and the lens holds perfectly from the dense opening to the charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, not ornamental. The storm-worn parapet and mist are a micro-setting that actively pressures the choice and charges the final image, constraining movement and perception. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully integrated into the POV's state of mind, with the "wet stone beneath his feet" humming with tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with pressure cohering and tightening through the approach of dawn and the envoy's emergence. The dominant stake (a fragile truce) is signaled early, and the cost of its success—Aris's severing of his own guilt—is legible and felt on the page in the final beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the specific image of the drawer pull and the action of "recycling mistakes into wisdom," resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of salvage and forgiveness through the final, charged image, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical signature that modulates with emotional intensity. The prose has a distinct, controlled texture. While the single line "reignite the war" uses a slightly common phrase, this is a minor artifact that does not disrupt the overall voice or clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A very minor instance of potential overwriting exists ("a scar of earth neither kingdom claimed, where only the dead held deeds"), but it is purposeful, voice-motivated, and does not obscure causality or dull the closure. No loops or scaffold are present.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story synthesizes familiar elements (war, grief, negotiation) into a profoundly original and specific whole through the unique central conceit of the drawer pull and the accumulative, textured execution. The risk-taking in the quiet, internal climax heightens stakes and coherence, feeling both fresh and inevitable.</comment>
