<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's weary undertaker persona is embodied through specific, concrete details ("shoulders permanently slumped") and his motivation ("to give rest a permanent address") is clear, consistent, and intensifies under pressure. His "inadvertent stubbornness" is not a label but a trait that drives his actions, culminating in a final choice (deferring his own rest) that is earned by prior causality with a visible, felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through dense sensory and emotional layers. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), achieved on the page as the light transforms the library's despair into fragile peace, with the cost legible in Silas's acceptance of his eternal vigil ("his own rest forever deferred").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underwater library is not a backdrop but the central crucible, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are masterfully selective and purposeful, filtered through Silas's professional POV ("ink-blurred manuscripts floating like spectral jellyfish"). The lighthouse lens itself functions as a micro-setting that dictates the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification of the central stake (giving rest) through the increasing density of spectral despair. Silas's agency in revitalizing the lens forces a final trade-off with clear cost: he achieves his goal for the spirits by forever binding himself to its maintenance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of giving rest to the unresolved emerges organically from the core concept and character. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the steady blue light, reweighting the broken lens and Silas's purpose without moralizing. The "chased stillness" of the final paragraph perfectly captures the thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and perfectly matched to the weary, precise undertaker POV. The prose has a consistent, rhythmic texture that modulates with emotional intensity without losing coherence. Purposeful compression is used effectively, and the perceptual signature is unwavering.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor instance of potential overwriting ("kelp and memory" could be seen as a slightly mixed metaphor), but it does not harm clarity or momentum. The closure image is rendered with crystalline precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of undertaker and deep-sea salvage is fresh and organic, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its premise, and the specific, lived-in details (tarnished brass, groaning pumps) create a powerful authenticity of vision. The final reconfiguration is both ingenious and emotionally true.</comment>
