<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is profound and consistent, rooted in tangible loss. Her patience is embodied in deliberate physical actions under pressure, and her final choice to preserve Lina's heartbeat feels earned. The single moment of telling ("Lina was gone") is brief and anchored in the present object, causing no deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the pattern-building intensifies pressure toward a decisive, resonant closure. The eclipse timeframe provides a coherent situational pressure that forces the final, costly act. The cost is legible in the final image of the "safekept sun," a tangible price paid for preservation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The subarctic crater orchard is indispensable, constraining every choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Elara's expertise and grief. The setting is a active antagonist, its frozen desolation making the act of preservation both necessary and costly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the outset: preserving memory against entropy. Pressure escalates through the accumulative pattern-building and the situational tightening of the eclipse. The protagonist's agency is total; her final action is a hard-won victory with a visible, felt cost, perfectly scaling to the story's length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict between memory and oblivion. The core concept of "safekept starlight" is a resonant, non-literal answer to this conflict, achieved through the concrete particulars of alchemy and loss. The ending avoids moralizing, offering a complex image of love preserved at a cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Elara's expertise and grief. The prose rhythm is controlled, modulating with the ritual's deliberateness. Purposeful compression ("Lina was gone") is effective and charged. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variety. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "moving stillness" is repeated, slightly dulling its impact. However, this does not obscure cause/effect or harm the closure image, and the overall execution is exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy, grief, and astronomy feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded detail in character and setting. The story commits fully to its singular, high-risk artistic stance, resulting in a memorable and authentic vision.</comment>
