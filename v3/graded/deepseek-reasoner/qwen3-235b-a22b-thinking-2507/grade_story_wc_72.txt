<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aelius's characterization is exceptional, with embodied emotion ("stone lips curving with the joy of welcomed nuance") and a clear internal arc from rigid sentinel to nuanced healer. His incisive kindness constrains his actions, as seen when his belief "crumbled like the city’s foundations" and he chooses mending over judgment. The final choice to thread the light is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the renewed garden.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (mending the pillar) with resonant reconfiguration (embracing nuance), landing with cost ("the garden exhaled a cloud of silt that settled like forgiveness"). The hybrid drive lens (causal-accumulative) holds: ampoule discovery triggers revelations, leading to the mending action. One meaningful tightening occurs as the ampoule's truth forces Aelius to act. Minor deduction for the ampoule's slightly convenient mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The underwater garden is integral, constraining choices (e.g., telepathy brushing fish minds) and charging the closure (Sundial Arch renewal). Sensory details are vivid and purposeful ("bioluminescent kelp swayed"). The ampoule and pillar function as micro-settings that shape tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, with Aelius gliding over mosaics toward the arch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the hybrid lens: ampoule discovery forces Aelius to reassess the past and act to mend the fracture. Stakes tighten from historical revelation to immediate structural danger. Cost is legible in the pillar's renewal and the garden's exhale. One meaningful deepening (ampoule's truths) suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (nuance vs. certainty) emerges organically through the ampoule's revelations and Aelius's arc. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("joy of welcomed nuance") without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like the "cloud of silt that settled like forgiveness." The final reconfiguration charges prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with lyrical prose fitting a stone telepath ("seawater swirling through the cracked dome"). POV is stable, and elision (e.g., Council details) is purposeful. Minor deduction for occasional complex sentences that slow momentum, but no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished with high information density, though some sentences are slightly ornate ("cascade of revelations began unspooling"). Rhythm varies effectively, and closure beats are clear. No loops or scaffold artifacts, but minor overwriting in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality is exceptional: a living statue in drowned Atlantis discovering truth through a poison ampoule is a fresh synthesis. The core concept (cascading revelations) shapes stakes and closure. Risk-taking in voice and setting heightens coherence. The ending feels inevitable yet innovative.</comment>
