<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction—chaste courtesan versus rebel—is embodied in her "bodily poetic language" and micro-choices under pressure. Her final act is earned by prior causality (mother's lost echo) with visible cost (sweat, trembling). The only minor flaw is a slight abstraction in "weaponized grace," but it doesn't undermine the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure escalates through sensory density and pattern breaks (lullaby fraying). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in "windows opened, voices rose." The central knot's resolution is a decisive, earned act that reconfigures the city's state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and its light-threads constrain choice and charge the final image ("dimmed, its purpose fulfilled"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "snow whispering," "cold strands"). Spatial choreography is coherent, and the courtyard evolves from serenity to "raw, beautiful chaos."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: each untangling ripple increases density and reweights stakes. Cost is visible in Elara's "spine arched" and the lullaby's resistance. The final unlock is a decisive tightening that forecloses the old order with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action (e.g., "vessel for poetry," "untouched skirts"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to conformity vs. voice through the "beautiful chaos" of reclaimed echoes. Subtext operates in silence and implication ("her silence had been the loudest defiance").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("frozen music," "spectral threads"). Diction remains within Elara's poetic lexicon. Purposeful compression (e.g., "between sigh and smile") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures accelerating tension. Minor artifacting: "weaponized grace" leans slightly abstract, and "living sonnet" is a mixed metaphor. However, clarity and propulsion are maintained, especially in the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of courtesan and rebel tropes through specific world logic (harvest of echoes). The prism sanctuary and untangling method are highly irreplaceable. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
