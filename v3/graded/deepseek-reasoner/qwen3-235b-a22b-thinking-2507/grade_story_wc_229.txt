<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, with embodied emotion (aching throat, trembling hands) and a micro-choice under pressure (using the vial). His final renunciation of noise for quiet intent is earned by prior causality (Mara's collapse, the broken lamp). The cost is visible in his tears, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the ship turns and Eli weeps, with felt cost legible on-page. The hybrid drive lens (causal agency + accumulative sensory density) holds. The broken lamp is a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is anchored early and clearly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse and fog pressure choices (broken lamp forces alternative method). The vial functions as a micro-setting that constrains and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (sea-slicked stone, scent of jasmine), filtered through Eli's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the ship) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by Eli's agency under the hybrid lens: the thickening fog and distant ship tighten options, forcing the vial's use. Cost is legible in his tears and the sizzling droplets, proving the quiet method's efficacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (quiet efficacy over noise) emerges organically through events and images (vial, turning ship), not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of Eli whispering thanks. Subtext operates in implication (Mara's fevered words, the scent's vibration).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward sensory and emotional filtering (scent as language, vibrations in bones). Prose rhythm modulates with pressure (short, intense sentences during the vial's use). No dialogue, but internal voice remains coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied syntax and rhythm. Figurative language ("screaming tenderness") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. No loops, scaffolding, or register drift. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements (character, atmosphere, plot).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The concept of scent as communication is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in quiet resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specific details (cobalt paint, midnight violets) anchor the premise in a singular vision. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
