<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, her "softly deliberate" actions and sharp-eyed vigilance effectively embodied. Her final choice to let the shadow metamorphose is earned by her discovery, though the emotional cost ("luminous regret") is slightly abstracted, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative/Textural lens, redefining hope's shape with undeniable cost. The linkage from discovery to action is coherent, though the lens is slightly ambiguous early on, leaning hybrid before settling into accumulative pattern-breaking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The library is a masterful micro-setting that pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully integrated into action, with the river stone and console acting as tactile, constraining objects within the environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, moving from observation to understanding to a transformative action. The cost is legible in the final, quieter ember and her "luminous regret," though the pressure could be slightly more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically from the core concept and character action, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of hope. The final image of the "solitary ember" reweights the prior material without moralizing, embracing complex ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature and controlled, purposeful diction. The prose's lyrical texture is consistent and voice-motivated, successfully teaching its pattern and paying it off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor tendency toward slightly over-stacked figurative language in high-pressure beats ("luminous regret settling deep within her bones") prevents a higher score, though clarity is never lost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The core premise is a fresh, specific synthesis of familiar concepts. The transformation of the shadow through unshareable memory is an ingenious, non-obvious turn that feels inevitable in hindsight, committing fully to its implications without retreat.</comment>
