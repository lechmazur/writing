<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and rooted in grief and logic, compelling her high-stakes choice. Her peripheral focus is a unique, character-particular trait that drives her method. The final choice to capture wonder rather than resurrect Silas is an earned renunciation with visible cost. A slight diagnostic feel in "Grief for Silas... had hollowed her, but logic was her anchor" prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory patterns and cadence shifts. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as wonder is captured, reconfiguring the stakes with a felt cost of enduring grief. The final image of the stored echo landing with the season's sigh provides undeniable cost proof. The linkage from reflection angles to resonance is taught and pays off flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The marble cavern is indispensable, constraining choice by providing the resonant material and the specific reflection angles needed for success. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully woven through action, reflecting Elara's professional priorities. The environment evolves with the light, directly charging the final image. The micro-setting of the workbench and prism functions as a crucial tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, as her observations of light patterns force a tactical shift to realignment. The dominant stake of capturing wonder before winter is signaled early and tightens with the imminent blizzard. The cost of her grief is legible but slightly less visceral than the wonder captured, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between grief and wonder, logic and resonance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the captured laughter, reweighting the prior material without moralizing. The core concept of harvesting echoes is fully integrated into the thematic question. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image, particularly in the final stored echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on geometry, resonance, and light. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity. Diction remains within Elara's plausible lexicon as a precise artisan. The elision of Silas's dialogue is taught and paid off in the captured echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("gears like frozen leaves") is purposeful and consistent. There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the discovery and decelerates into the resonant closure, perfectly matching scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a locksmith reverse-engineering time to harvest echoes is a fresh, non-obvious concept that feels inevitable in hindsight. The specific, grounded choice of using light angles transforms a potential trope. Emotional truth and human complexity are prioritized over surface novelty. The risk-taking with a quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
