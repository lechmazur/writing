<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and compelling, rooted in specific trauma. Her frustration and final breakthrough are embodied and earned. The silent expressiveness is a consistent, character-specific trait that enables on-page choices. A minor deduction for the thermal imager's function feeling slightly convenient at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara redefines her relationship to silence. The cost is legible in the final image of the humming resonator and the botanist's tears. The quartz resonator's introduction is the single meaningful cadence shift that reweights the stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is indispensable, a micro-setting that pressures choices and supplies the key resource (the glacial lilies). It constrains the entire narrative and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and perfectly filtered through Elara's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens. The dominant stake (translating silence) is clear, and the final cadence shift (using the resonator) is a meaningful deepening that reweights options. The cost is felt in the requiem's purpose being fulfilled.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "unshaken marvels" and the action to "rectify." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—silence is not empty but a canvas. The final image of warmth writing symphonies perfectly encapsulates the thematic synthesis without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature tuned to heat and silence. The prose rhythm is controlled and modulates with emotional intensity. The elision of sound is taught early and paid off magnificently at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush but purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor figurative density in the final paragraphs ("liquid moonlight," "quiet fire") slightly softens the peak beat's clarity but does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise—translating heat into music after deafness—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis executed with high conceptual integrity. The combination of elements feels organic and inevitable, not checklist-driven. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
