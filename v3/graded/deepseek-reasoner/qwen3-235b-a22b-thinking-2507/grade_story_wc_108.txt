<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., "vulnerability felt like a raw nerve"), and her transformation from broken to empowered is earned through the causal chain of decoding. Her aquaphobia and adaptive nature are not labels but drivers of micro-choices under pressure. The final stance—weaponizing vulnerability—is a credible, earned endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds tightly: the decoding (because) leads directly to the video revelation (therefore). Closure is a decisive change with felt cost ("electric hum of reclaimed agency," "trembling felt like strength"). Orientation is immediate and clear; the library setting and cast are anchored within the first 50 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("rusted library groaned," "gritty cast"), but the setting primarily functions as atmosphere rather than actively constraining choice. The cast and seashell act as micro-settings that charge the final image, but the library itself is more backdrop than crucible, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early (expose sabotage/reclaim agency). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: the decoding breakthrough forces the decisive video recording. Cost is legible on the page in the final beats ("trembling certainty," "sob caught between terror and triumph").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically from concrete particulars (the cast, the phobia, the decoding) and is resolved in the final image without moralizing. The seashell's final whisper ("You were always enough") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Maya's profession and trauma ("career adapting mid-fall"). Diction and syntax reflect her stress and clarity under pressure. The elision of the cipher's mechanics is purposeful and taught, paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Minor register elevation ("electric hum of reclaimed agency") feels voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity. Sentence-level craft supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of stunt double, aquaphobia, and a child's cipher feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of transformative betrayal is executed with specificity, not as a template. Risk-taking in the lyrical, metaphorical prose heightens stakes without obscuring coherence.</comment>
