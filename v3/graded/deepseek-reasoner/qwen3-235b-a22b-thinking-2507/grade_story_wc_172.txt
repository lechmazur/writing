<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Thorne's contradictory impulses—ruthless capitalist and secretly sentimental preservationist—act simultaneously in scene, most powerfully when he kneels to place the egg. His final choice is earned by a prior causality (the memory of the lark feather) and carries visible cost in his broken posture. The internal conflict is embodied, not summarized, and his micro-choices reveal a clear hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost: the empty pouch and the raindrop on the salt make the price of his offering legible. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through a cadence shift from the quiet lull to the returning thunder. The final image reconfigures the meaning of his entire venture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The salt flat is not a postcard but a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The "map drawn by cracks" is the central navigational tool, and the environment's "fractured grace" is the story's dominant tone. Every sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Thorne's specific, guilt-tinged perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, tightening through the cadence shift of the approaching storm. The dominant stake (preserving an echo) is tested by the ecologist's warning and the environment's silence, culminating in a choice with a clear, on-page cost—the empty pouch and his broken posture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of cost and memory through the final image of the egg in the crack and the returning rain. Theme emerges perfectly from the juxtaposition of the manufactured drought and the futile, sentimental offering, embracing complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, controlled perceptual signature that reflects Thorne's worldview ("fractured grace incarnate"). POV is stable and deeply internal, with diction and syntax consistently matching his character. The sparse dialogue is natural and serves to heighten the central conflict.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the opening paragraph ("crunching like shattered glass," "blinding expanse of white"), though it is pattern-taught and does not obscure closure. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold; propulsion is clear and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of the amoral philanthropist and the extinct bird's egg is specific, non-obvious, and feels inevitable. The core concept of a "manufactured drought" is transformed through grounded, lived detail and a unique moral calculus. The story commits fully to its premise without safety-hedging.</comment>
