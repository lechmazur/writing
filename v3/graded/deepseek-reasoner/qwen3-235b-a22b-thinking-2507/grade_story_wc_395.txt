<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is singular, clear, and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to lie and defy authority. Her internal state is embodied ("heart pounded") and her final choice to launch the script is earned by her established obsession. The mission patch is a concrete anchor for her emotional state, and her competence is balanced with genuine struggle against a system and a supervisor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (exposing the truth) with clear conceptual cost (the void's hunger remains). The causal lens holds tightly: her discovery of the video fragment leads directly to writing the script, which forces the final confrontation with Vance. The orientation is immediate and the plot amnesia check is passed; every beat advances the central mystery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The social network archive is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and constrains tactics, fully integrated into the plot. The sterile console glow and the mission patch are recurring objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional and personal priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens: each discovery (the numbers, the VOID, the video) tightens the options and raises the stakes, culminating in the irreversible choice to launch the script against Vance. The cost is legible on the page in Vance's crumbling defiance and the archive's silent hum, confirming the persistent threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of memory, consumption, and loss emerges organically from the core concept and specific events. The final image of the archive "ready to swallow its next victim" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question about the nature of deletion and memory, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Elara's perceptive, analytical mind. The prose has a distinct, controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The only minor deduction is for a slight convergence in dialogue under peak stress between Elara and Vance, though their internal motivations remain distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise, vivid, and highly propulsive, with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("the archive hummed on, ready to swallow its next victim in silence"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. A single instance of near-duplicate phrasing ("sensed absence") is minor and does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a corporate data thriller with a personal missing persons case feels fresh and organic. The core concept of a memory-eating archive is ingeniously executed through the specific mechanic of number-coded fragmentation. The story commits fully to its premise, and the final reconfiguration feels both surprising and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
