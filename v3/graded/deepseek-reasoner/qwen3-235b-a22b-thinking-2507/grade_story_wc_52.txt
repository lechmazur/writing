<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The widow's characterization is strong with embodied emotion and clear motivation, though the emotional range is somewhat narrow. Her micro-choice to carve is a credible endurance tactic. However, the emotional state lacks the contradictory impulses and credible irrationality needed for the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, landing with undeniable cost in the final image of "love reshaped by absence." The pattern of "here and gone" is taught early and pays off, with the crystallized time method cohering perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The skylight loft and ash wood blank are micro-settings that powerfully constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully integrated into the POV's perception, mirroring her internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency to carve, a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens that reweights the dominant stake of grief. The cost is legible in the tear and the act of shaping sorrow, though the pressure could be slightly more coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of grief's transformation emerges organically from concrete particulars, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image of "love reshaped by absence" is an earned insight that reweights prior material with profound ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with a strong perceptual signature. The prose rhythm is generally controlled, though a slight template cadence emerges in the final paragraphs ("The rain continued...", "She would finish..."), preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and economical with high information density. A minor template cadence and a slight paraphrase loop ("contain the storm... shape sorrow") in the peak beat prevent a higher score, but clarity and momentum are excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lion tamer's widow and wood carving feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "here and gone" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and theme, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
