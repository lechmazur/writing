<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation intensifies credibly from despair to action, compelled by the ghost's "strangely trustworthy aura." His embodied emotion ("heart hammered") and the colony's collective mobilization show character under pressure. The final choice to trust and act is earned by prior causality, though the internal contradiction between his hope and the colony's exhaustion could be more simultaneous in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (water discovery) with felt cost (ghost's departure). The causal lens holds tightly: messages trigger logical investigations that narrow options. The aquifer discovery pays off the "reexamine the roots" instruction. Cost is legible in the final image of the silent bell and the ghost's absence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard planet setting pressures choices (drought, floating arches) and the watering bell charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("frost from the apple tree bark," "cracked permacrete"). The environment constrains tactics and the nebula's light "pooling in the newly flowing water" reconfigures the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens: the message compels investigation that tightens options. The dominant stake (survival) is signaled early and deepens through the aquifer discovery. Cost is visible in the collective labor and the ghost's fulfilled departure, though the escalation from minor crises to major discovery is slightly swift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images (water as "nebula made manifest") and the ghost's altruism. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to collective hope without moralizing. Subtext operates in the ghost's silence and the bell's echo, though the phrase "brambled hope" in the text feels slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Kael's perception. Voice has a distinct texture ("hope felt like brambles"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Anya's skepticism, Renn's interruption). The prose rhythm varies effectively, though some sentences in the climax are slightly congested.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid with strong information density. Sentences advance story and atmosphere ("ghost appeared, not with a shriek, but the soft, clear chime"). Minor scaffold exists in adjacent sentences describing the ghost's form, but no loops or artifacts harm closure. Read-aloud rhythm is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The altruistic ghost premise feels fresh and is transformed through specific, grounded choices. The combination of sci-fi setting and spectral guide is organic. The core concept (nebula as literal respite) is ingeniously realized. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, though the "strangers to family" arc is familiar.</comment>
