<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with his limestone-dusted fingertips and fiercely meditative breathing establishing a concrete professional identity. His internal conflict between individual sorrow and collective grief is dramatized through his ritual actions, culminating in an earned epiphany when he ties the ribbons. The spectral mentor's presence feels organic rather than expository, pressing Silas toward his realization without dictating it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration: the monarchs form a "vessel" of shared remembrance, reconfiguring Silas's understanding of grief from solitary to collective. The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, with each ribbon-tying beat intensifying the pattern until the final image crystallizes. Cost is legible in Silas's first tears since the funeral, a visceral price paid for his new understanding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as a crucible that constrains and charges every choice—its "iron bones" and "shattered propagating case" are tactile constraints. Sensory details are purposefully selective: "limestone grit" under fingertips, "polished river stone" coolness of the ghost. The environment evolves from a place of solitary grief to one of "immense, quiet presence," directly shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Silas's agency under the accumulative lens: each ribbon he ties reweights the stake and intensifies the pattern. The cost is unmistakable when his hands tremble pulling Neruda's ribbon, and the monarchs' reconfiguration charges the final image with felt consequence. Pressure coheres through tactile actions rather than abstract declarations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the ribbon-tying ritual and butterfly mosaic, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: grief as "the greenhouse itself, ancient, sheltering, transformed by what it held." Subtext operates powerfully in gestures—tying ribbons to specific locations charged with memory. No moralizing; complexity resides in the space between lines and wings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Silas's stonemason lexicon ("chisel-shavings," "weave tight and sure"). Voice maintains a lyrical yet concrete texture under pressure, with rhythmic control in phrases like "a vast, breathing curve echoing the vaulted arches." The ghost's dialogue is distinct yet tonally coherent, avoiding voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is densely poetic but maintains propulsion, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("their wings folded like tiny stained-glass windows" combines image, theme, and setting). Minor figurative density in peak beats ("thundering calm") slightly risks obscuring clarity, but the closure image remains sharp. No loops or scaffolding; every line advances the accumulative pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, butterfly migration, and poetic ritual feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the spectral mentor is justified by its integration into the tactile world ("coolness of polished river stone"). The core premise avoids template plots through specific lived detail—the ribbon technique mirrors epitaph transfer, grounding the metaphor in character.</comment>
