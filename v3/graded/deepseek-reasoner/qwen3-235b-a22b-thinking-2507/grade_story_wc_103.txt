<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied ("heart hammered a rhythm against his ribs"), with micro-choices under pressure (crawling, grasping the fragment) revealing a clear hierarchy of values. The final realization ("The texture of time was grief") is earned by the dramatized loss of the photographs, with visible cost. A slight deduction for the protagonist's passivity in the garden's collapse, which is more witnessed than acted upon.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held. Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the blank photograph with a "watermark shaped like a clock" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The orientation is immediate and the pattern of accumulating loss (fading photos) pays off decisively at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is indispensable, actively pressuring the protagonist and shaping his every move. Its hyperbolic geometry is the engine of the conflict, and its collapse ("not with a crash but a sigh") directly charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (escape, preserving memory) and escalate through the accelerating disintegration of the fragment and the photographs. The cost is intensely legible on the page as the final photo turns blank. A minor deduction as the final escalation is more environmental (the bridge collapsing) than a direct result of the protagonist's last, reactive choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict and particulars. The ending delivers a resonant, non-literal answer ("The texture of time was grief") that profoundly reweights all prior imagery without moralizing. The integration of concept (time), object (photographs), and emotion is flawless and deeply affecting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized through a distinct perceptual signature ("time into origami shapes"). The prose's lyrical, dense texture is consistent and voice-motivated, perfectly matching the protagonist's refined, desperate consciousness. The controlled elision (e.g., the workmen's blurred faces) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language ("like smoke caught in amber") is precise and purposeful. Rhythm is masterfully controlled, accelerating with the fragment's disintegration. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure the powerful closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of hyperbolic geometry, retrocognition, and celestial artifact feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded detail. The emotional truth is paramount, avoiding gimmickry for a profound and authentic exploration of grief and regret.</comment>
