<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kael's meekness and quiet determination are embodied through specific actions and micro-choices, culminating in a credible, earned sacrifice of his voice. His internal contradiction—quiet exterior versus burning resolve—is dramatized under pressure, and the final renunciation has a visible, felt cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly; the closure is a decisive change (planet's revival) earned by Kael's specific sacrifice, with cost legible in his internal silence. The because/therefore linkage from finding the silk to the ritual in the mines is tight and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating arches are not just backdrop; they directly pressure the choice to use the mine shafts and charge the final image with the renewed tree. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's professional and urgent perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens; the stakes (planetary revival) are signaled early and tightened by the unknown cost of the ritual. The price—Kael's voice—is paid on the page and alters the final state with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of resilience through sacrifice emerges organically from concrete events and images (silk, mines, withered tree). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the planet's pulse and the renewed tree, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature attuned to broken things and quiet defiance. Prose rhythm is controlled, though minor density in figurative language prevents a 9+. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "profoundly alien" sensation description). No loops or scaffolds; clarity and momentum are maintained through the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The combination of a meek blacksmith, bartered magic, and a shattered planet feels fresh and specific. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through with integrity, transforming familiar tropes through grounded, particular choices.</comment>
