<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes through concrete interaction with the ghost and the bolt plate, moving from observation to decisive action. Her internal contradiction—a silent balladeer finding voice—is embodied in her "rusty" singing, earning her final stance. The micro-choice to press the plate against the stone and later to sing reveals a clear hierarchy of values. A slight deduction for the "tinkersong wonder" label which, while evocative, edges toward diagnostic summary in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the ghost's need shifts from connection to artistic expression, answered by Elara's song. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure escalates through pattern breaks (shifting symbols) and a cadence shift into song. Cost is legible on-page: her voice is "rusty from disuse," and the final peace is earned. Linkage is tight, with the bolt plate's function revealed through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The misty courtyard and flower press bolt plate are indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The bolt plate's physical properties ("rough edges biting," "vibrating") and the mist's behavior ("swirled like liquid smoke") are filtered through Elara's goal-directed perception. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, reflecting urgency (e.g., "dew-slicked flagstones" for cold, immediacy). The setting evolves from a place of search to one of connection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by the ghost's intensifying requests ("hunger" → "I miss the sun" → "Teach me to sing"), each deepening the stake from observation to co-creation. Elara's agency is clear in her decision to encode a reply and then to sing. The cost is her vulnerability in using her neglected voice. A single, meaningful tightening from communication to artistic collaboration is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the union of technological remnant and human artistry, answering the central question of connection through the non-literal image of shared song. The final exchange—"Teach me to sing" met with a ballad—is a resonant, earned answer that reweights the ghost's coded existence as a yearning for beauty. Subtext operates powerfully in the ghost's encoded messages and Elara's physical actions, avoiding any direct thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's perceptual signature ("driftingly alert," "tinkersong wonder"). The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythmic variation, especially in the climax ("the first notes... clear as a bell"). The one instance of potential label-speak ("tinkersong wonder") is minor and voice-motivated. Elision is purposeful, with the ghost's history learned through integrated, concrete detail.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in a few phrases ("driftingly alert," "tinkersong wonder") which, while voice-consistent, approach decorative density in high-pressure beats. However, these do not obscure causality or closure. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, accelerating into the song and fading with the thunder. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "ghost in code" with a balladeer using a analog tool is a fresh, non-obvious, and fully integrated concept. The combination feels inevitable in hindsight, transforming familiar tropes of AI and connection through specific, lived detail (the bolt plate, graffiti). The risk-taking—a quiet, technological/haunting story resolved through song—heightens stakes and coheres perfectly, supporting the closure.</comment>
