<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her "perpetually learning" trait driving micro-choices under pressure. Her final realization and decision to create the sculpture feel earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her shivering endurance and transformed perspective. The closure shows credible endurance that forecloses her prior path of mere survival.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with the lantern slide's layered revelations escalating through density increase. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Mara finds the driftwood spiral, reconfiguring her relationship to the storm with felt cost. Orientation is immediate and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway constrains choice and charges the final image, functioning as micro-setting. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's sculptor POV. The archway's physical pressure and the driftwood's tactile history are indispensable to the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, as she actively interprets the slide's images. The stakes intensify through density of revelation rather than causal turns, with cost legible in her transformed understanding. One meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete images and actions rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of timewoven alliances through the driftwood spiral image. No moralizing or thematic echo in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control under pressure. POV remains stable and consistent, with voice modulated by emotional intensity. The "turbine-hum" motif is taught early and paid off at closure. Some minor syntactic uniformity in mid-passages prevents higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with mostly clear propulsion. Minor template cadence appears in three consecutive "she would" sentences near the end, creating a slight rhythmic pattern. No figurative muddle in peak beats, and closure remains unaffected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar elements through specific, grounded choices. The concept of timewoven alliances feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation of the driftwood sculptor archetype through particular lived detail.</comment>
