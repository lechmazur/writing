<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ms. Thorne’s interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("expectantly resigned understanding"). Her motivation is clear and her final choice is earned, though a brief lapse into telling ("Hatred, she realized...") slightly abstracts a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear, felt cost on the page ("the resonance of voices finally heard"). The library's stillness and the rosette's function are taught early and pay off decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The library and the rosette are not just vivid but functionally indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully integrated into the POV's perception and the story's thematic logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres and escalates through a decisive intensification: the shift from internal reflection to the active, difficult choice to implement the "subtracting noise" exercise. The cost of this unlearning is legible in the choir's initial awkwardness and final transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from event and image, never stated. The final image of the rosette offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of division and harmony, reweighting all prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with a strong perceptual signature. Minor register drift in a high-pressure beat ("the cumulative weight of unspoken assumptions") slightly dulls immediacy, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A single instance of potential synonym churn ("fractured her choir... silencing the very music") is minor and does not obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a musical artifact's physical function with a psychological conflict resolution strategy is a fresh, non-obvious, and fully integrated angle. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight and heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
