<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, specific, and intensifies through her micro-choices. Her final act of placing the globe is a perfect Earned Stasis, a renunciation that forecloses a path with the felt cost of her frozen tears. The only minor flaw is a slight tendency to tell her method ("weaves truth carefully") rather than purely show it through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, building pressure through the density of dream fragments until the final, resonant reconfiguration of the snow globe's meaning. Closure lands with undeniable cost ("Tears froze on Elara’s cheeks") and the persistent constraint of her method shapes the entire narrative arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glacial shrine and melted snow globe are not merely vivid; they actively constrain Elara's choices and charge the final image. The shrine's "borrowed starlight" and the globe's "cloudy amber heart" are purpose-driven, concrete details that are indispensable to the narrative's logic and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is masterfully driven by Elara's agency in analyzing the dream fragments. The stakes tighten with each interpretation, culminating in the climactic revelation of the crew's lie. The cost is legible on the page in her physical reaction and the profound emotional weight of the truth she exposes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of salvaging purity from wreckage emerges entirely through concrete action and image, resisting any direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the snow globe from a symbol of collapse to a "promise," achieved without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that remains controlled under pressure. The voice is consistently filtered through Elara's specific, professional yet spiritual worldview. Purposeful compression is used to powerful effect, especially in the dense, revelatory dream analyses.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional. The prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. Sentences like "windows of connection holding fast against the dark" do multiple jobs, advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diving, ghost-whispering, and dream analysis is highly original and feels organic and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with breathtaking specificity, transforming its components into a singular, authentic artistic vision.</comment>
