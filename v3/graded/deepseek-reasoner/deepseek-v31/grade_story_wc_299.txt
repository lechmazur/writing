<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with micro-choices (brushing the speaker cloth, his heart hammering) revealing his internal state. His final resolution feels earned by the causal discovery of Leo's letters. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on diagnostic language ("insulating emotionally with facts") in an early reflective block.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A strong causal drive lens is established and held. The inciting incident (the foreman's task) leads directly to the discovery, which forces the protagonist's decisive reconfiguration. Closure is a resonant, earned stasis with clear cost: "He was still confidently uncertain about how to do it, but his own purpose, at long last, was clear."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the plot and character. The quarry office and main shed are not just backdrops; the shed's environment ("cathedral of rust") directly constrains the choice to wrest the case free, and the final image recharges the trailer window and the speaker cloth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (professional and existential failure) and escalate through a single, powerful causal tightening: the discovery of Leo's letters. This discovery narrows Silas's options and forces a stance crystallization, paid for with the emotional cost of confronting a buried past.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of the protagonist's present and his discovered past. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of purpose after loss, reweighting the speaker cloth and the concept of "after the applause" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Silas's professional and emotional lens. The voice is distinct and consistent, with a perceptive signature ("synaptic echo of a thousand load-ins"). The single line of dialogue is natural and serves to advance the plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly effective ("cathedral of rust and silence"). A minor deduction for a single potential artifact: the phrase "synaptic echo of a thousand load-ins," while evocative, edges toward a register slightly elevated from the surrounding text.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a down-on-his-luck roadie, a quarry setting, and a decades-old mystery feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of life "after the applause" is transformed through specific, grounded particulars rather than remaining a generic trope.</comment>
