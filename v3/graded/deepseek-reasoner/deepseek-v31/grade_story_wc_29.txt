<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and rooted in her cautious, analytical nature, intensifying to a "gnawing drive" under pressure. Her final choice to interfere is a decisive change earned by prior causality. The only minor deduction is for a slight diagnostic label in "profound and unsettling suspicion," though it's quickly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (the signal is dissolved, the crowds are pacified) with a clear, felt cost of exhaustion and a reconfigured worldview ("maps of endless, silent questions"). The causal lens holds tightly from the inciting incident (signal) to the discovery (anomaly) to the climax (counter-broadcast).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The university radio station is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and supplies the crucial resources for the counter-attack. The "astronomical charts" and "humming consoles" are not just described but are integral to the plot, constraining and enabling the protagonist's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: the discovery of the subsonic carrier wave forces a higher-stakes choice, narrowing options to one desperate, protocol-breaking act. The cost is legible in the final image of exhaustion and the "battered but not broken" hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly from the core concept, exploring the cost of contact and the nature of manipulation versus genuine communication. The final image of "endless, silent questions" offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though it leans slightly toward thematic summary in the last line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, controlled texture that blends scientific precision with lyrical grit ("ozone and old coffee," "ethereal grit"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through Aris's professional and perceptual biases. The dialogue from Leo is brief but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. A single minor artifact exists: the phrase "profound and unsettling suspicion" has a slight label-like quality, but it is an isolated instance in an otherwise flawlessly propelled narrative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of first-contact and psychological thriller tropes through the specific lens of subsonic manipulation. The core concept is fully committed to and its implications are followed with ingenuity and conceptual integrity.</comment>
