<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from observer to participant is deeply motivated by her established trait as a "noticer." Her final choice to plant the orris root is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values and is earned by the prior causality of her discovery. The cost is felt in the damp earth soaking through her jeans and the profound shift in her purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story operates on an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, with details layering to a resonant reconfiguration (RR) at closure. The final image of the house sighing and the windows shimmering with potential is a decisive change charged with palpable cost. The lens holds perfectly from the initial accumulation of details to the culminating cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is not merely described but is the engine of the plot. The garden and its displaced objects directly constrain Elara's choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and fully integrated into the action, such as the damp earth and the scent of the orris root.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens. The stake—understanding what makes a house alive—deepens into a tangible mission. The cost is legible in her physical act of digging and the subsequent wave of warmth that sanctifies the house, foreclosing her path as a passive observer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of donated serenity emerges organically from the particulars of the displaced objects and Elara's final act. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The final paragraph reweights the entire story, transforming the concept of a "noticer" into an active participant in creating peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The voice possesses a distinct, consistent perceptual signature, beautifully filtered through Elara's specific way of seeing the world. The prose rhythm modulates perfectly with the emotional intensity, from the lyrical opening to the hushed, profound climax. There is no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional line-level craft with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language ("a shard of hush itself") is precise, purposeful, and enhances clarity. Sentence rhythm is varied and propulsive, perfectly matching the accumulative texture and culminating in a powerful, clear closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "noticer" character with the concept of "displaced objects" donating essence is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is fully committed to and executed with singular vision, transforming a familiar Gothic trope into a fresh, quiet act of creation. The risk-taking with a quiet, accumulative structure heightens the stakes.</comment>
