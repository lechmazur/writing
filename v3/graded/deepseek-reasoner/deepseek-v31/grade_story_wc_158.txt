<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's insomnia and poetic role are embodied in concrete actions and micro-choices, particularly her weary transcription and the final, decisive act of carving. Her motivation clarifies with earned epiphany, rooted in the specific sensory experience of the shell's song. The final choice to translate the peace feels earned by prior causality, though the insomnia itself is more a state than an active constraint on her choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural drive lens is clear, with pressure building through sensory density and a cadence shift at the discovery of the lullaby. Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara sleeps, the cost legible in her exhaustion and the planet's sigh. The structure is taut, with a single, continuous scene that moves from failure to purpose with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is the story's masterstroke, a micro-setting that intensely pressures Elara's choice and decisively charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply filtered through her poetic, pained perception. The environment is inextricably woven into the action and thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single, powerful deepening: the discovery of the lullaby reweights the dominant stake from chronicling pain to translating peace. This is driven by Elara's agency in listening and interpreting. The cost is felt in the planetary hum softening and her final, heavy exhaustion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of translating pain into peace emerges organically from the specific particulars of the shell, the lullaby, and Elara's role. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of permanent armistice and earned sleep. Subtext is rich in the shell's song and the redefined purpose, completely avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The poetic, lyrical voice is distinct and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature shaped by Elara's vocation and despair. Syntax and rhythm modulate effectively with emotional intensity. There is a minor tendency toward ornate phrasing ("reef-shadow joy"), but it remains voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is excellent. A slight deduction for figurative density in the final paragraphs ("reef-shadow joy," "photosynthesized the agony") which, while beautiful, edges toward over-writing in the peak beat without a clear pattern-teaching payoff earlier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a insomniac poet, a fossilized leviathan, and a sonic armistice is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotionally complex conclusion. The choice of a quiet, resonant reconfiguration over a dramatic confrontation is a confident, original risk.</comment>
