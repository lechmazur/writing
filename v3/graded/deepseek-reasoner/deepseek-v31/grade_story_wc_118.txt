<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alistair's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with his "sensitively perceptive" trait driving his frantic investigation. His final motivation shift—from collector to "the wall"—is earned by the preceding discovery and his palpable grief. A slight deduction for a minor over-reliance on diagnostic language ("archeologist of cataclysm") in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is clear, building pressure through layered revelations. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Alistair reconfigures his purpose, with the cost of his grief and new resolve legible on the page. The structure is taut, with each discovery logically deepening the central mystery and stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library is a masterful, atmospheric setting that actively constrains and defines the narrative. The "bronze quiet" and scent of "aged paper and cold concrete" are purposefully woven into the tone and Alistair's perception. The tapestry fragment charges the final image, transforming from artifact to key revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are masterfully signaled early with the "deeper emptiness." Escalation is driven by Alistair's agency as he probes the diaries and cross-references texts, leading to the devastating revelation. The cost—the understanding that his life's work is an "autopsy"—is profoundly felt and alters his entire purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of lost wonder and the duty of memory emerges organically from the specific particulars of the diaries, the tapestry, and Alistair's grief. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through his decision to write, adding his story to the walls. It embraces complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct, perceptive voice that filters the world through Alistair's scholarly yet sensitive lens. The prose rhythm is controlled and purposeful, modulating effectively with the rising tension. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush, precise, and highly atmospheric, with excellent rhythmic control. Minor deduction for a slight density of figurative language in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "archeologist of cataclysm," "performing an autopsy") that, while effective, borders on over-writing. Otherwise, it is exceptionally clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise—a metaphysical "displaced axis" causing the end of dreams—is strikingly original and fully committed to. The synthesis of a post-apocalyptic mood with a medieval tapestry and a historian's quiet crisis feels fresh and inevitable. The specific, grounded choices in voice and setting elevate it beyond its conceptual parts.</comment>
