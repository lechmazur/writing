<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aelia's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling higher-stakes choices. However, her internal conflict lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; her care is singular, not self-contradicting. The final endurance is earned, but the absence of a genuine flaw or blind spot limits the depth of her characterization under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong causal lens holds throughout, with clear because/therefore linkages (bell's chime enables manifestation, messages prompt action). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as understanding shifts, landing with undeniable cost in the settlers' transformed resolve. The final beat on the arch is the exact moment of cost legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, woven through action. The setting is richly established but functions more as a beautiful backdrop than a constraint that actively shapes tactics or choices; the arches are a location, not a pressure. This prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aelia's agency under the causal lens: her failed messages force the higher-stakes choice to reveal herself. The cost of her drained energy and the settlers' fraying faith is legible, culminating in the final, riskier command that successfully reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the specific struggle, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—partnership in a celestial dance—that reweights the prior labor without stating a thesis. The integration of concept (nebula) with theme is seamless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, elevated register that suits the ethereal narrator. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like "particulate silence," which feels slightly academic for the POV, preventing a higher score. Control is otherwise exemplary.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "brambled hope" is a slightly strained metaphor that briefly calls attention to itself. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are excellent, with no loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghostly warden, a mystical orchard, and a celestial cure feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the messaging system and the settlers' community, avoiding cliché. Risk-taking in the quiet, visual climax pays off.</comment>
