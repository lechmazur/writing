<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear, rooted in a specific worldview ("preserve the shape of hope"), and intensifies under pressure, compelling her higher-stakes choice to metamorphose. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("a chill that had nothing to do with the library’s climate," "heart heavy with a regret that seemed to glow"). The final choice is earned by the causal chain of her investigation and the visible cost of her transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds perfectly. The plot is a tight because/therefore chain: she finds an anomaly, therefore she investigates, therefore she understands the threat, therefore she acts. Closure is a decisive change (her metamorphosis) with a clear, felt cost ("her own painful metamorphose") that lands on the page. The persistent constraint of the entity's hunger shapes her final tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The "blooming library" is vividly rendered and actively pressures the choice by providing the tools (reader, catalog) for her investigation. The river stone is a micro-setting object that constrains the geomancer's choice and charges the final image as the entity's vessel. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Aris's professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aris's agency under the Causal lens. The dominant stake (containing the pathogen) is signaled early through her motivation. The investigation is a meaningful tightening that narrows her options from archivist to warrior. The cost is unmistakable on the page: the entity's hunger becomes a "cold pressure against her mind" and her metamorphosis is "painful."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment>The theme of hope vs. commodification emerges organically from the central conflict and the geomancer's tragedy. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: hope must sometimes be forged into a weapon for preservation. The core concept of "luminous regret" is earned through the specific, dramatized experience of discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Aris's perceptive, professional voice ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer"). The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity without losing coherence. The patterned elision of how exactly she compares the videos is taught and pays off in the revelation, trusting the reader to follow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("a beautiful, terrible light of understanding dawning too late"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful, accelerating with the final race against time.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The premise of a dream-library is fresh, and its combination with a psychological horror entity is a non-obvious, ingenious synthesis. The concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical conclusion. The specific lived detail of the geomancer's videos and the river stone's aberrant shadow transforms a familiar trope into something singular and memorable.</comment>
