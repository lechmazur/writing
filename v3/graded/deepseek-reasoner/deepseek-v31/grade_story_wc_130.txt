<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving her to higher-stakes choices. Her internal conflict is embodied and concrete, avoiding diagnostic speech. The final renunciation (placing the eyes as an offering) is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Her emotional progression feels realistic, with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands on the page with undeniable conceptual cost ("her relation to it had been forever changed"). The pattern of sensory and emotional density increases decisively, reweighting the dominant stake. Orientation is clear by ~100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cavern orchard and mosaic stone are not just described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, fully integrated into action and thought. The environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. The setting evolves from a place of grief to one of sustenance, directly shaping the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift and density increase that reweights the dominant stake. The protagonist's agency (choosing to use the glass eyes) drives the deepening. The cost of her transformed understanding is legible on the page, fundamentally altering her relation to the loss and the orchard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of ambiguous loss emerges entirely through events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. The core concept integrates seamlessly with the specific particulars of the petrified trees and Elara's own loss. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose has a distinct texture in word choice and syntax that reflects Elara's analytical yet seeking mind. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deduction for a slight register elevation in the climax ("Understanding bloomed, cold and beautiful") which, while voice-motivated, borders on the abstract. Otherwise, sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere with concision and momentum. No loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of mathematics, emotion, and magic feels organic and fresh, not a checklist. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on grief, transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The use of the glass eyes is a bold risk that heightens stakes and coherence. The story commits fully to its premise.</comment>
