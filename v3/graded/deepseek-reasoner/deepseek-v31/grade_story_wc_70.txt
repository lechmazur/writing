<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arawn's involuntary truthfulness is a consistent, constraining trait that drives micro-choices (e.g., admitting fear of the box) and culminates in his final, thematic decision. His emotional progression from diagnostic technician to wonder-preserver feels earned through specific, embodied struggle. The final choice to prioritize life over light is a credible renunciation with visible cost, rooted in his established characterization and his grandfather's influence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that lands with clear cost: the city remains dark, but its life is restored. The causal lens holds tightly from the blackout to the discovery of the riddle and the pulse battery, with each beat narrowing options logically. The final image of the empty, honey-scented box is a decisive conceptual repricing that reweights the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lightning tower is not just a backdrop but a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and supplies the critical resource (the pulse battery). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Arawn's professional expertise (e.g., "humming conduits were silent"). The recurring lacquer box charges the final image, and the "nectar dusk" sky establishes a tone that pays off in the bees' return.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: the blackout creates the initial pressure, Arawn's diagnostic mind seeks the connection to the bees, and the discovery of the riddle forces the final, costly choice. The dominant stake (city's food vs. power) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. The cost of foregoing the reboot is legible in the continuing darkness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between routine and wonder, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: the empty box containing the scent of honey. This final image reprices the premise without moralizing, affirming that wonder is preserved in action and sacrifice, not in objects. The integration of concept (beehive failure) and character motive is flawless.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Arawn's technical, candid perspective. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, with a rhythmic control that modulates between diagnostic precision ("monitor the great capacitors") and lyrical observation ("sky the color of spilled honey"). There is no dialogue, but the internal voice is consistently particular and compelling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and vivid, with high information density and zero artifacts. Sentences are propulsive and varied, accelerating with the discovery of the riddle and breathing at the resolution. Figurative language ("a silent catastrophe blooming") is precise and purposeful, never muddying clarity. The final line is a masterclass in strategic telling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a candid toll keeper, a city-wide blackout, and drone beehive failure is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully committed to and explored through its implications for both plot and theme. The specific, lived-in details (lacquer box, pulse battery) prevent abstraction, creating a fresh, memorable perspective on a classic thematic conflict.</comment>
