<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaelyn's motivation is clear, rooted in professional duty and personal desperation. Her actions under pressure are embodied and character-specific, particularly the tactile listening with her fingertips. The final renunciation of her old role for a new one ("keeper of this silence") is earned by the on-page struggle and carries visible cost in her breathless collapse. Minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label ("effort of the conjuring") in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through sensory density and a cadence shift into the "bloom of hush." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the storm's energy is alchemized into profound peace, with cost legible in Kaelyn's physical exhaustion and the caves' palpable relief. The pattern of quiet conquering chaos is taught early and paid off impeccably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are not a backdrop but the central crucible of the conflict, pressuring Kaelyn's actions and supplying the key tool (the stone). The setting's evolution from "hammered repose" to "profound peace" is choreographed through concrete, sensory detail. The obsidian disc constrains choice and decisively charges the final image as a "new permanent star."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (restore the peace) and escalate through the stone's "terrified heart" pulse, a clear intensification under the accumulative lens. Kaelyn's agency is a masterclass in guided renunciation, persuading rather than fighting the energy. The cost is felt in her drained state and the tangible transformation of the caves' atmosphere.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept: peace is not the absence of storm but the shape of its aftermath. This is earned through the specific, dramatized action of subdividing chaotic energy into silence. The final image of the stone as a star offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Kaelyn's professional, tactile perception ("listening with her fingertips"). The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates perfectly with the emotional intensity of the conjuring. A single, very minor register drift ("effort of the conjuring") prevents a higher score, but the voice is otherwise exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythmic control. Minor deduction for a slight overwriting tendency in the climax, with a cluster of figurative language ("like a flower opening in reverse time") that, while beautiful, slightly softens the immediate sensory impact of the transformative moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mapkeeper, energy beings, and sonic alchemy via ice-crack patterns is strikingly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of conjuring silence from pandemonium is a fresh, non-obvious angle executed with full commitment to its implications and emotional truth.</comment>
