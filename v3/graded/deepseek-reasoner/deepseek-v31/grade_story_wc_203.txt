<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear, rooted in his dual vocation, and intensifies under pressure. His final choice to engage feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the emotional weight of his promise. The ghost's embodiment could be slightly more specific in her initial appearance, but this is a minor quibble.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong causal linkage under a clear causal lens: the discovery of the ledger's ghost leads to the ghost's appearance, which compels the investigation of the ceiling, triggering the vision and the decisive, cost-laden closure. The final cost is legible in the girl's dissolution and Leo's solemn vow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail that constrains choice and charges the final image. The dust patterns, the scuffed shoe, and the mainspring barrel itself are all integral to the plot and theme, creating a palpable atmosphere of neglect and lost time.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Leo's agency under the causal lens: his decision to drag the desk and open the panel is a major tightening that narrows options and unlocks the climactic vision. The stake—freeing the ghost by witnessing her secret—is paid for with the emotional cost of his unprecedented engagement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from the particulars of the discovery, the vision, and the final exchange. The story offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of what is hidden and what constitutes a completed life, reweighting the opening premise without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, observant perceptual signature firmly anchored in Leo's professional and personal worldview. A few filter verbs ("he saw") cluster in the initial observation paragraph, but this is a minor artifact that does not obscure clarity or disrupt the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptionally high information density and rhythmic control. The prose is concise, vivid, and propulsive, with every sentence advancing story or atmosphere. The description of the vision is a standout, seamlessly integrating sensory overload with narrative revelation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A fresh, specific synthesis of the ghost story and the repairman trope, transformed through grounded character choice and a deeply integrated setting. The combination feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
