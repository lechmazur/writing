<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aveline's motivation is iron-strong and deeply rooted in her identity as a closure seeker, compelling her high-stakes psychic exploration. Her internal conflict is rendered through embodied, contradictory sensations ("phantom limb of memory... but the arm was still there"). The final choice to unwrap her bandages is an earned micro-choice that forecloses her old path of seeking external miracles, with the cost of accepting her solitary healing legible on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens dominates, with pressure escalating through a cadence shift into the plant-guided memory tunnel. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Aveline reinterprets her scars not as texts to be read but as seals of her own earned healing. The cost is felt in the acute ache of revelation and the final, careful unwrapping, which reweights all prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tower, the bandaged arm, and the hourglass function as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply filtered through Aveline's POV ("viscous tendrils of anesthesia," "meteor hush"). The ivy's pot and the stone sill are tactile anchors that enable the pivotal action of tunneling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aveline's agency under the accumulative lens, using her plant telepathy to actively tunnel into the memory of surgery. This deepens the dominant stake of seeking truth in scars, culminating in the revelation of the displaced miracle. The cost is the sharp, acute ache of this revelation, which reconfigures her understanding and tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of finding meaning in one's own healing, not in external events, emerges powerfully from the particulars of the scar, the plants, and the hourglass. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of unwrapping, reweighting the premise without moralizing. The ivy's memory of the sun provides a subtle, organic counterpoint that deepens the thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature that filters the world through Aveline's unique psyche. The prose has a controlled, poetic rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity ("a susurrus of root and tendril"). Purposeful compression in the tunneling sequence is taught and paid off, maintaining clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven ("marooned in a cold, quiet tower," "phantom limb of memory"). Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating through the tunnel sequence and breathing into the final realization. No loops, scaffold, or artifacting detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a closure seeker, plant telepathy, and a displaced miracle is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, poignant conclusion. The specific, grounded choices in character and world-building transform potential tropes into a singular, authentic vision.</comment>
