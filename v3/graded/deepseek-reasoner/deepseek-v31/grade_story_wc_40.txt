<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's reticence and scholarly obsession are embodied through concrete actions (running fingers on lexicons, kneeling to gather shards). Her final choice to testify is earned by the crystal's revelation, a clear before/after change with visible cost in her hammering heart. Minor deduction for motivation initially feeling slightly abstract, though it solidifies beautifully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through layered sensory and historical density. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara's testimony reconfigures the library's meaning. The cost is legible in the janitor's awestruck face, a point of connection proving her action's impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The library and chandelier are not just backdrop; they actively constrain and enable the plot. The crystal shard, a micro-setting, is the key object that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, reflecting Elara's scholarly POV (e.g., "dust of a finished purpose").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from personal decoding to a public testimony, driven by Elara's agency in choosing to climb and speak. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, with the crystal's power forcing a stance crystallization. The cost is the vulnerability of her amplified, solitary voice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of language's living growth emerges organically from the chandelier's revealed function and Elara's final testimony. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "the final chapter was still being written." Avoids moralizing; meaning arises from the juxtaposition of the child's laugh and theorist's sigh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's scholarly, precise perception. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture ("suspended hush," "fractured sequences of memory and sound") that modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; elision (how the crystal works) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without losing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("seed vault for living meaning"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with the "dizzying tapestry" of sequences. Zero loops, scaffold, or artifacting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core concept—a chandelier archive of sound—is a fresh, ingenious synthesis of familiar tropes (memory palaces, libraries). It feels inevitable in hindsight. The lyric mode is a bold risk that heightens stakes and coheres perfectly, fully committing to its premise.</comment>
