<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and rooted in her analytical nature, with embodied emotion ("microscopic ridges grating faintly against her thumbprint"). Her final choice to leave the roof open is an Earned Stasis, a credible endurance foreclosing a path with visible cost, earned by the prior causality of her study.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that lands on the page with felt cost ("She did not rush to repair the glass roof"). The persistent constraint of her grief and analytical mindset shapes her tactics and the final, charged image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse and the butterfly wing are micro-settings that profoundly constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Aris's POV, with the wing's "nanostructured ridges" reflecting her professional lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification through the density of observed dust patterns, which reweights the dominant stake of her grief. The cost is legible in her final, quiet renunciation of control ("She did not rush to repair the glass roof").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of finding continuity in fragmentation emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the open roof, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature that blends scientific precision and lyrical observation ("a cosmos"). The prose's rhythm and diction consistently reflect the mind and state of the focalizer, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences that advance story and character. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("a cosmos"). There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of neutron star research and personal grief feels organic and inevitable. The specific, grounded choice of the butterfly wing offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on renewal, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
