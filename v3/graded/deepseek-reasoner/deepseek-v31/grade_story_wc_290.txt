<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobia and precision are embodied contradictions that drive her pivotal choice. The final act of plunging the compass is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her trembling breath and white knuckles. Her micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, balancing fear and competence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly; the organ's note triggers a spatial mutiny that escalates because/therefore to the climax. Closure is a decisive change with clear cost: the room's snap back to stability and the key's manifestation. The compass anchor point is a motivated ellipsis that narrows options decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The domed ceiling alleviates her claustrophobia, the etched charts guide her action, and the folding walls apply direct pressure. The compass as a micro-setting object is indispensable to the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</comment>The dominant stake (uncovering the key) escalates through coherent causal pressure from the spatial mutiny. Elara's agency in plunging the compass narrows options and resolves the conflict with a visible cost—the room's violent snap back to stability. The tightening is driven by protagonist choice under duress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the marriage of precision and chaos, crystallized in the final image of mapping internal fear. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The key of "crystalline sound and starlight" reweights prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that filters setting through professional bias and phobia. Syntax modulates under pressure ("the walls seemed to breathe"). No head-hopping or register drift. The voice remains coherent and purpose-driven throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without artifacts. Figurative language ("spatial mutiny", "dust-thick blanket") is purposeful and consistent. No loops, scaffold, or muddy metaphors. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the crisis and resolves cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic horror and archival precision feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "spatial mutiny" is transformed through specific character choices and stakes. Risk-taking in blending genres heightens coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
