<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal conflict is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses (trembling fingers vs. operatively gentle discipline) acting simultaneously. Her final choice of stillness is earned by prior causality of war trauma. A minor deduction for "diagnostic self-awareness" in the phrase "muster the courage not to fight," which briefly flirts with therapy-speak in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear, felt cost ("the agonizing, meticulous work of peace"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through a cadence shift from internal reflection to external negotiation. The final image of the celestial dance reweights the prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (e.g., "cool wood," "perfume of night-blooming vines"). The ebony clipboard functions as micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image. Capped below 9.0 as the ancient terrace, while atmospheric, does not decisively pressure tactics or alter options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a single, decisive cadence shift into the negotiation beat, which reweights the dominant stake of peace. Protagonist agency drives the escalation through her "flawless grace" performance. Cost is legible in the "tense silence" and the delegates' hesitation, making the peace feel precarious and hard-won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of redemption's price is fully integrated, emerging from concrete particulars (the soldier's memory, the ritual) rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: peace is not absolution but a ledger balanced through "agonizing, meticulous work," resisting a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature ("stately waltz of planets," "ash-choked cries"). Lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure. Diction remains within the character's lexicon even under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, though slightly overwritten in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a performance of flawless grace, yet beneath it lay a flawed beauty"). A minor deduction for a paraphrase loop: "the price had been paid" slightly restates "redemption was a ledger of pain" without new pressure. No artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a galactic peace treaty with a intimate, ritualistic personal cost feels fresh and inevitable. The concept is fully committed to, with the ebony clipboard and negotiator role offering a non-obvious angle on a familiar archetype. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes.</comment>
