<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, compelling a high-stakes choice. Her internal contradiction—debunker confronting a truth stranger than myth—is dramatized in scene. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost (foregoing textbook rewrite). Embodied emotion under stress ("profound silence bloom in her mind") avoids diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds: letter fragments logically lead to "stillpoint" realization, storm forces introspection, and discovery reconfigures goal. Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis (protecting truth) with felt cost (renouncing discovery fame). Orientation is immediate; cost is legible in the final choice to "leave it buried."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposefully selective ("radioactive grit," "orange haze"). The wasteland orchard actively pressures choices (storm trapping her) and the diamond as a micro-setting constrains tactics and charges the final image. Sensory detail reflects POV urgency and professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate coherently under causal lens: external storm and internal letter-reassembly deepen knowledge, forcing a decisive choice. Protagonist agency drives the turn (intuition guides new understanding). Cost is visible in the final renunciation. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events: the pursuit of truth versus its protective concealment. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the preserved orchard. Subtext operates in the shredded letters and the realized "stillpoint." Complexity is embraced without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, analytical texture. Elision (letter fragments) is taught and paid off. Diction remains within the POV's lexicon ("geological oddity," "null-energy"). Internal thought formatting is consistent, and prose reflects the character's mind under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("tapestry of comfortable lies"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, especially in the storm climax. Read-aloud test passes cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic debunker and physics-based "stillpoint" feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept transforms the cursed diamond trope through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the quiet, thematic ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. A singular artistic stance is evident.</comment>
