<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zephyr's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, moving from obsessive stillness to necessary action. Her embodied emotions and professional competence are shown through concrete micro-choices, particularly when she analyzes the birds' flight as data rather than panic. The final choice to physically intervene is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her trembling muscles. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously when her weathered resolve strains but does not crack.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change achieved through protagonist agency, with cost legible in the physical strain and the profound wave of silence. The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through sensory details and pattern recognition. The birds' flight provides a crucial data pattern that leads to the solution. Orientation is immediate and purposeful, with no causality breaks.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The bone canyon setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Zephyr's professional perception. The arrowhead and bone towers are tactile objects that directly impact the climax. The environment evolves causally with events, particularly the trapped pulse altering the sonic geography.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the discordant echoes creating coherent pressure that forces Zephyr to adapt. The stakes are visceral and concretely tested through her failed mappings and the birds' behavior. The cost of physical intervention is unmistakable on the page. The resolution is earned through her altered understanding and action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central paradox of navigating without moving, which is reweighted by the ending's realization that true understanding requires engagement. The final image of the profound silence as the source of sound offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates powerfully in the birds' flight language and the trapped pulse concept. No moralizing or thematic statements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Zephyr's perceptual signature, with distinct rhythmic control under pressure. The prose has a distinct texture with purposeful compression and elegant syntax. No dialogue present, but internal voice remains coherent and specific throughout. All elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>  
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits exceptional clarity and concision with high information density. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs, accelerating during the climax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm is sophisticated and varied, with strong verbs and specific nouns throughout.</comment>  
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise of sonic navigation in a bone canyon is strikingly original and fully committed to its implications. The transformation of the "navigate without moving" concept through specific lived detail feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in world-building heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and human complexity are achieved through particularity rather than generic templates.</comment>
