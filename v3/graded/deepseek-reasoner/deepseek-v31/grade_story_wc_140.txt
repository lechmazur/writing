<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is crystalline and rooted in his erased identity, compelling his archival mission. His final stance as "keeper of the silence" is an Earned Stasis, foreclosing the path of reclaiming his name with a visible cost of perpetual witness. Embodied emotion is specific, avoiding diagnostic speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing where the poison label reweights the entire system's cost. The final image of the flooding tide makes the cost of his endurance legible and undeniable. Causality is tight, with the clerk's warning serving as the final, confirming turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The container yard is indispensable, a micro-setting that constrains movement via the tides and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposefully selective ("salt-haze glowed orange," "grimy bedrock"). The labyrinth physically embodies the thematic concept of erased histories.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: his choice to investigate the container and later confront the clerk. Each action narrows his options and raises the conceptual stakes, culminating in the chilling confirmation. The cost is the irrevocable knowledge of "systematized removal."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges organically from action and image, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the protagonist's purpose is not resurrection but witness, with the "texture" of memory being "sharp, bitter, and fragile as old paper."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, analytical voice suited to an archivist. The single line of dialogue from the clerk is potent and goal-driven, carrying immense subtext. Minor register drift in phrases like "null set" is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A single minor artifact exists: the phrase "abstracted, two-dimensional representation of death" feels slightly academic for the POV's peak moment, creating a tiny register drift (-0.1). Otherwise, flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bureaucratic ghost, a container yard setting, and a theme of archival absence is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded particulars, transforming a familiar trope into a singular vision.</comment>
