<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ayla's characterization is rich with specific, embodied interiority and a clear, evolving motivation. Her final choice to approach Kael is earned by the vision's causality, with visible cost in her altered understanding. The "warmly observant" trait consistently filters her perception and drives her tangential method.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly, with pressure escalating through a decisive cadence shift into the vision. Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Ayla's understanding is reconfigured, with cost legible in her breathless state and the softened confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The grotto setting is vividly rendered through selective, POV-filtered sensory detail and actively constrains choice. The jade cicada, a micro-setting object, is indispensable, charging the final image and enabling the pivotal vision that drives the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single, powerful deepening via the vision, which reweights the dominant stake (their relationship) with clear cost. Agency resides in Ayla's decision to use her newfound understanding to alter her tactical approach with Kael.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of character, object, and vision, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer about time as a relational tapestry. The final image of the stars reinforces the theme without moralizing, offering earned wisdom from concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature. The prose's rhythmic control is exceptional, modulating with emotional intensity. The tangential method of inquiry is taught early and paid off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and precise with high information density and strong rhythmic propulsion. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the vision sequence ("syrupy," "pinwheeled"), though it remains coherent and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal-pool chronicler, jade cicada, and thematic concern with time feels fresh and inevitable. The specific, grounded choices in character and setting transform potential tropes into a singular, authentic vision, though it stops short of being radically innovative.</comment>
