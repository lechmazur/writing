<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with Aris's frustration and subsequent surrender rendered through concrete micro-choices (e.g., opening the vents, turning off systems). His internal contradiction—the desire for control versus the need to yield—is dramatized in scene, and his final renunciation of control is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres through sensory and emotional density, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Aris shifts from data collection to participation. The closure lands on the page with felt cost ("a deep, quiet root taking hold") and the lens holds without contradiction, shaped by the persistent constraint of his failing methodology.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse environment is a vital, pressure-exerting presence, constraining Aris's initial choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through his professional POV, with the mossy trellis and storm actively shaping the narrative's outcome and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aris's agency under the Accumulative lens, as his decisive act of surrendering control constitutes a meaningful tightening that forecloses his old path. The cost of this choice is legible on the page, reconfiguring his options and charging the final image of his internal transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of control vs. surrender emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The final reconfiguration of the linden leaf from "anomaly" to "testament" reweights prior material without moralizing, offering profound thematic closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Aris's perceptive, scientific consciousness. The prose has a distinct, rhythmic texture that modulates with emotional intensity. A minor register drift ("circuitously sincere") feels slightly authorial but is isolated and does not significantly disrupt the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A single, minor artifact exists: the phrase "circuitously sincere" introduces a slightly elevated, authorial register that clashes minutely with the POV's lexicon, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a scientific mindset with a lyrical, internal transformation feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is executed with high specificity and authenticity, committing fully to its premise and implications without retreat into cliché.</comment>
