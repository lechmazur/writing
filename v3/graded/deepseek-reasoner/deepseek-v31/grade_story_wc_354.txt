<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("hopeful melancholy swelling in his chest"). His motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling his choice to help. The final endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned by prior causality, with the cost felt in the final image of the dented stone. His "thoughtfully precise" demeanor is consistently shown through measured words and actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (the cartographer's return) with a resonant reconfiguration (Kael's renewed purpose). The causal lens holds firmly: Kael's method directly causes the breakthrough. Cost is legible on the page in the brother's shuddering breath and Kael's feeling the stone's dent as a "record of a battle finally won." Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The magnetic Nexus is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and supplies the core method (humming a counter-frequency). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("perpetual chime," "charged air"). The worry stone, a key object, constrains choice and charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens: his decision to help and his precise application of his method. The stakes (healing the brother's silence) are signaled early and tightened through the intense, time-sensitive humming sequence. The cost is the emotional and mental energy Kael invests, made legible in the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully from events: finding meaning in silence and beauty in difficulty. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("beauty was the move that healed the board") that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext is rich in gesture and implication, particularly in the brother's tapping as a "desperate silence."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, precise narrative voice. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though brief. The only minor flaw is a slight register elevation in the final paragraph ("terrible, beautiful truth"), but it remains consistent with Kael's reflective, tutor-like voice and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. A minor deduction for slight density in the final paragraph, where the thematic conclusion ("beauty was the move that healed the board") verges on abstraction, though it is earned by the scene. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a strategic mind applied to a metaphysical problem feels fresh and organic. The concept of "translating silence" is a specific, non-obvious inflection that is integral to the plot. While the exiled tutor trope is familiar, it is transformed through the unique setting and the specific, grounded choice of his method.</comment>
