<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, specific trait (acoustic obsession). Her final choice is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (sacrificing her last link to the past). However, her profession as an illustrator is not fully integrated into her on-page choices, serving more as backstory than a crucible for her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Decisive Change with felt cost (losing her inheritance). The inferred Causal lens holds: her discovery of the flaw leads her to the Spire, and her heritage enables entry. The Warden's exposition, while necessary, is a minor pacing dip that slightly softens the otherwise tight causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposefully selective (e.g., "glimmering rooftop canal system," "cascading silence"). The pendant charges the final image, but the environment itself, while atmospheric, does not consistently constrain choices or tactics throughout the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (saving echoes, preserving time) and escalate coherently under the Causal lens from personal quest to city-wide salvation. The final choice presents a clear, high-cost trade-off. The pressure is maintained, though the confrontation with the Warden resolves a little quickly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice for preservation emerges organically from the core concept and Elara's choice. The final action is a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest, reweighting the value of echoes and personal history without moralizing. The infinity symbol effectively embodies the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filtered through Elara's acoustic perception. The prose has a distinct, rhythmic texture that supports the atmosphere. The Warden's "chorus of every possible age" is a strong, voice-motivated deviation that enhances the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally concise and vivid with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slightly mixed metaphor ("fracture and die" for echoes) and a trace of explanatory language in the Warden's dialogue. These do not significantly harm clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The core concept of a city built between moments and governed by acoustic time is highly original and well-executed. The combination of elements feels organic. The premise is fully committed to, though the "chosen one" trope of her heritage is a familiar inflection point.</comment>
