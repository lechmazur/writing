<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation evolves credibly from contract to sacred duty, anchored in the felt experience of the frequency. Her sharp-eyed expertise is consistently shown, not told, and her "perpetually surprised" trait effectively conveys awe without diagnostic labeling. The final choice to guide by sound is earned by the prior sensory shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (the frequency as felt connection, not data) with clear cost (the duty to teach a silent world). The Causal lens holds: her actions with the bar and chip directly trigger the revelation. Orientation is immediate and the final image reconfigures all prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The observatory is a masterclass in micro-setting, actively constraining choice (the heavy brass bar) and charging the final image (projected starlight). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional and emotional state. The "brilliant dimness" tone is sustained throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: pulling the bar and aligning the chip are decisive, difficult actions that narrow options and lead to the revelation. The stake (decoding the frequency) is clear and the cost (a new, weighty duty) is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between data and sensation, sight and sound. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "belonging" through the planetary hum, reweighting the pilgrim's quest without moralizing. The core concept of "missing pieces" is fully integrated into the climax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, analytical quality suited to a drone pilot. The prose rhythm effectively modulates with the scene's pressure. Minor register drift occurs in the climax ("harmonic resonance of a planet") but is brief and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density. A slight figurative density appears in the climax ("tiny city of grooves," "tuning fork for the soul") but the pattern is taught and pays off, and clarity is maintained. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of sci-fi (drone pilot, chip) with a quasi-mystical pilgrimage feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the observatory's mechanics. The final reconfiguration of belonging as a felt frequency is a genuine risk that pays off.</comment>
