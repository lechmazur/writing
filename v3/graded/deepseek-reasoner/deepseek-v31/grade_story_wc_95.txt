<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Valerius and Elara are distinct, motivated, and their micro-choices under pressure (the feint, the final salute) reveal hierarchy of values. The mechanical arm is a consistent trait that enables the winning move, though its integration into his interiority is slightly functional. Elara's "diplomatic fierceness" is shown through her serene intensity and respectful nod, creating a credible, earned partnership at closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong causal drive lens: each fencing move is a logical proposition in the equation, culminating in the decisive disengagement and thrust that provides the final variable. Closure is a clear Decisive Change (finding the book) with cost legible in the echoed clatter of the foil and the hushed, breathless atmosphere of the final image. The linkage from duel to discovery is airtight and inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass atrium and quiet brook are not merely decorative; the specific pane of "deeper green" glass is the key to the solution, constraining the final choice. The half-painted sundial is seamlessly integrated into the action as the tool for alignment. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV's analytical focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with each parry and lunge narrowing the options toward the solution. The cost is the intensity of the duel itself, a "controlled storm" that makes the final, quiet discovery feel earned. The dominant stake (accessing the library) is clear from the outset and is resolved through their combined effort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of translating conflict into discovery ("violent poetry... into a tangible truth") is fully integrated into the action and the final image, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to find truth through opposition. A slight deduction for the phrase "violent poetry of their conflict," which edges toward thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a precise, analytical texture that matches Valerius's philosopher nature ("proposition in a silent debate"). The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the action, from the delicate whirring to the controlled storm of the duel to the hushed aftermath. No dialogue is present, so those elements are N/A.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exemplary line-level craft. Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive without a single loop or artifact. Sentences like "They fought with a dignified chaos, a controlled storm of gleaming steel" achieve high information density and vivid imagery. The read-aloud rhythm is flawless, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a philosophical duel, a mechanical arm, and a geometric cipher is highly original and feels organic, not checklist-driven. The core premise is executed with full commitment and conceptual integrity, resulting in a singular and memorable piece. The risk of a silent, action-driven negotiation pays off brilliantly.</comment>
