<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is sharp and consistent, rooted in specific grief. Her micro-choice to carve a cupped hand instead of a lion reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. Embodied emotion ("the exact pressure of his hand") avoids diagnostic speak. The final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the integrated calm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory density to a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise). Closure lands with cost in the "fertile ground" image, reconfiguring absence into integration. Orientation is immediate and clear. The persistent constraint of the kettle's timeframe shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The loft and rain-beaded skylight actively constrain choice by defining the workspace and timeframe. The ash wood's grain is a tactile map under her thumb, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (contain grief) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by her agency in seizing the memory of Leo's hand, a meaningful deepening that reweights options. Cost is legible in the transformation from "roaring grief" to "rust-hued peace." The kettle's clock adds coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the carving act: containing love, not loss. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the cupped hand, reweighting prior pain into "love’s quiet architecture." No moralizing; subtext operates in implication and sensation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that notices "ghosts of sawdust" and "map of forgotten rivers." Diction remains within her lexicon; syntax varies with emotional intensity. The elision of Leo's physical presence is taught and paid off in the tactile memory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density ("linseed oil and the ghosts of sawdust"). No loops or artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Rhythm accelerates with the kettle's hiss and settles into the calm. Closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief and art through the specific concept of carving a negative space. The cupped hand is a fresh, non-obvious inflection that feels inevitable. Risk-taking in a quiet, internal resolution heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
