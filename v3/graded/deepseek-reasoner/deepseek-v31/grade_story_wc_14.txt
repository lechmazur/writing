<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and rooted in specific, concrete traits ("to collect the textures of different times"). Her interiority is character-particular and embodied ("her hands, still dusted with flecks of precious foil"). The final state of "quiet, radiant fulfillment" is an Earned Stasis that feels credible and costs her a night's sleep, though a touch more internal contradiction during the vision sequence could have elevated it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held perfectly. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the visions cease with dawn, reconfiguring Aris's state to one of "incandescent" fulfillment. The cost is legible in her "stiff" body and the palpable loss of the visions as the lamp's hum steadies. The structure is impeccably coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail. The bonsai labyrinth and the stone pavilion are not just described but actively constrain her journey and focus. The fluorescent lamp is the quintessential "micro-setting," its specific properties directly enabling the core action of refraction and charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (collecting time's texture) and escalate beautifully through the intensifying visions, which act as a cadence shift under the Accumulative lens. The pressure is coherent and the cost of the endeavor is felt in her stiff body at dawn. A slightly more defined internal risk taken to achieve the visions would have pushed the score higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "invented histories," exploring the tension between recorded and perceived time. The final image of Aris carrying "a universe of histories" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this central question without moralizing. The subtext in the lamp's hum as a "key" is particularly effective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly matched to the protagonist's studious, perceptive nature. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic quality that modulates with the intensity of the visions ("She scribbled furiously"). There is no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally exquisite, with high information density and vivid, specific imagery. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the climax ("a palimpsest of invented histories, narratives woven from light and sound"), where the figurative language stacks and slightly muddles the sentence's clarity in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core concept of collecting time's texture through a fluorescent lamp's hum is brilliantly original and executed with full commitment. The synthesis of the mundane (a failing lamp) and the metaphysical (experiencing epochs) feels both fresh and inevitable. The specific, grounded choices in character and setting prevent it from feeling like a gimmick.</comment>
