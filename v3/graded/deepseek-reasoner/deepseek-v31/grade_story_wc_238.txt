<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a decade of guilt, compelling her high-stakes choice to confront the ghost. Her internal conflict is embodied in micro-choices like uncorking the perfume bottle and her simple, overdue apology. The final renunciation is earned, foreclosing her path to redemption with the visible cost of the roaring saws outside. Her professional trait of advising through metaphors is not just a label but a constraint that shapes the ghost's forgiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the ghost's dissolution reconfigures his legacy into the archive's atmosphere. The cost is legible in the "sweet and melancholic" release and the single sheet of music finally heard. The linkage is tight: her apology, his metaphorical forgiveness, and the external saws create a cadence shift that reweights the stake of legacy. The persistent constraint of the impending orchard cutting charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sheet music archive and the orchard are not decorative; they constrain choice and charge the final image. The archive supplies the energy for her craft and the final nocturne; the orchard's scheduled cutting provides the external pressure and the metaphor for the ghost's forgiveness. Sensory details like "decaying paper" and "sweet, terminal bloom" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional and emotional POV. The environment is inextricably woven into the narrative's action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, using her unique method to reconnect the ghost to his passion. The stake of delivering an apology and achieving peace for the ghost tightens through a single, meaningful deepening as he relives his entire artistic life. The cost is unmistakable: the ghost's "painful, exquisite" shudder and his final, metaphorical forgiveness. The external pressure of the saws provides a coherent, complicating force that reweights the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of imperfect miracles and the cost of legacy emerges entirely through event and image, not statement. The ghost's final words offer a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights Elara's apology and his own scandal as a necessary part of a larger growth. Subtext operates powerfully in the metaphorical exchange of forgiveness, deeply integrated with character and conflict. The final image of the lost nocturne provides a profound thematic closure without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive texture that modulates with emotional intensity ("peculiar, weighted silence," "soundless crescendo"). The ghost's dialogue, "like the rustle of turning sheet music," is perfectly idiomatic and advances the plot through indirection and metaphor. The prose is character-specific, with Elara's professional observations coloring her perception. Purposeful compression is used effectively, with no head-hopping or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences like "a captured memory of rosin and pipe smoke that seemed to thicken the air" do multiple jobs. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. The final line is a masterful image that resolves and recharges the central motifs. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a gossip-column exorcist and a musical ghost is a fresh, non-obvious angle that feels organic and inevitable. The core concept of "imperfect miracles" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, not a trope. The story commits fully to its premise, and the final reconfiguration is earned through prior particulars. Bold risk-taking in the metaphorical resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
