<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in her professional trait of "bright attentiveness" and a personal, haunting curiosity. Her micro-choices under pressure—cross-referencing the sequence, bypassing encryption—are consistent and drive the plot. A minor deduction for a lack of deeper internal contradiction in her peak realization moment; her shift from corporate keeper to truth-seeker is compelling but could benefit from more embodied conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The causal drive lens is clear and holds: each discovery leads logically to the next, culminating in the decrypted transmission. Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, reweighting the entire premise with the horrifying realization that deleted files are uploaded, not erased. The cost is legible on the page in the final image of the humming archive sounding like an "answering chorus," making the absence a palpable presence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The social network archive is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and supplies the clues Elara needs. The recurring numbers and the virtual patch are objects that charge the final image, with the patch's "embroidered threads now seeming like a gateway." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens: her investigation tightens from a mundane check to uncovering a corporate lie and a cosmic horror. The dominant stake (uncovering truth) is signaled early and deepens with each discovery. The cost is the terrifying reconfiguration of her understanding of reality, made legible in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of memory, deletion, and digital afterlife emerges organically from the plot and setting. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question ("where do deleted files go?") that reweights all prior material without moralizing. The final image of the "answering chorus" lingers with profound thematic ambiguity and horror.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The POV is stable and effectively filtered through Elara's analytical, yet increasingly uneasy, perspective. The prose has a distinct, controlled texture suitable for the tech-noir atmosphere. A minor, almost imperceptible register drift in phrases like "sensed absence" and "celestial archive" slightly elevates the diction beyond the POV's likely lexicon at peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is concise, vivid, and highly efficient, with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("the felt of the virtual patch seemed to radiate a profound, sensed absence"). No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle are present, even in the high-pressure climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a corporate thriller, a cosmic horror mystery, and a philosophical inquiry into digital afterlife feels fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its chilling implications, transforming familiar SF tropes through grounded, particular details and a strong, consistent voice.</comment>
