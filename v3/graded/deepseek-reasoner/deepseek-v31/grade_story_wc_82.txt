<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear, rooted in grief, and intensifies under pressure. His internal conflict is embodied through specific actions like polishing and folding, with micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. The final renunciation feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the soul piece sacrificed. Emotional progression is realistic, avoiding diagnostic speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—the soul sacrifice and transformed grief. Causal lens holds: each step follows from prior motivation. Orientation is clear within 120 words. The gem's creation and transformation drive the plot tightly, with no outline-like sequencing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Setting is integral, constraining choices (basilica's cost, workshop's solitude) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "thin and sweet with the scent of mountain blossoms"). Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment evolves with the emotional arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under causal lens: sacrificing a soul piece for the gem, then transforming it through labor. Stakes are signaled early (grief void) and tighten with the cost paid. One meaningful deepening (gem to crane) reweights options with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through transformation of grief into art, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the lantern's light. Subtext operates in gesture and image (folding as goodbye). Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with distinct perceptual signature ("luminous torment"). Prose reflects Leo's state under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift. Experimental compression (e.g., "descends while ascending") is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance story and atmosphere ("a shattering sorrow gilded by the beauty"). Grammar and punctuation are clean, with purposeful syntax variation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and fully committed, synthesizing grief processing with magical elements. Turns feel earned (e.g., gem creation cost). Specificity in details (volcanic glass, dream recording) avoids tropes. Risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
