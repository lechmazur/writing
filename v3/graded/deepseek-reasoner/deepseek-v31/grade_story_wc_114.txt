<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rhys's characterization is deeply integrated with his role and crisis. His "peripherally aware" trait is not a label but a method, demonstrated through his focus on the botanical illustration and harmonic data. His final choice to seek truth in the margins is earned by his established nature and the weight of the swallowed event. The emotional progression from fever-hollow to auroral sorrow to cold resolve is embodied and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through sensory and conceptual density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure is a Charged Poise: Rhys's realization reconfigures his world and duty with immense, cold resolve. Causality is tight; the inciting incident (witnessing the avalanche) directly motivates the convalescent investigation. The cost is legible in the final image of the "resolve as cold and solid as the brass weight."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is a crucible, not a backdrop. It pressures Rhys physically and conceptually. The botanical illustration and the brass weight are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is exquisite and purposeful, like the "crisp hollow of convalescence" and "dust mote dancing." The environment is fully filtered through Rhys's professional and personal priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Rhys's agency under the accumulative lens. The dominant stake (the validity of his world-view) tightens through a single, profound deepening: his shift from checking the "ignorant" main console to the marginalized harmonic data. The cost of this paradigm shift is palpable in the "auroral sorrow" and the "terrorifying freedom" that replaces his certainty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from event and image. The conflict between centralized data and marginalized truth is explored through the specific particulars of the avalanche and the forget-me-not. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: truth and resilience are found by yielding and studying the edges, not confronting the center. No moralizing, only profound, earned conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, a blend of technical precision and lyrical perception that perfectly reflects Rhys's character. The prose's rhythmic cadence modulates with emotional intensity, from the fever-blurred opening to the crisp, resolved finale. POV is stable and deeply internal, with no head-hopping. Elision (the week of fever) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is masterful. Sentences are dense and propulsive, doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent, vivid, and never muddled ("bone-deep ache," "auroral sorrow"). There are zero loops, scaffolds, or artifacts. The read-aloud rhythm is varied and compelling. The final line lands with immense power and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a fault-tolerant oracle, a swallowed truth, and a method of knowing from the margins is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept of "swaying certainties" is transformed from an abstract idea into the story's central dramatic engine. The specific, verifiable detail of the weather station and botanical study grounds the high concept in a memorable, authentic vision.</comment>
