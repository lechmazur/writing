<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias is characterized with concrete interiority and embodied emotion; his practical nature ("fuel levels, grocery lists") contrasts with his warm letter-writing, creating credible contradiction. His final protective choice is earned by prior causality—the letters' revealed importance and his "wholly foreign" surge of instinct—with visible cost (confronting the void).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: Elias's cairn-building crystallizes his defiance, reconfiguring the space and stakes. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density and emotional weight. A minor deduction: the ghost's recoil from the cairn, while thematically fitting, feels slightly abrupt, lacking a final causal beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The lantern room is a masterful micro-setting that actively pressures choices (the iron grating, the gears, the jar's hiding spot). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("scent of salt and old sorrow"). The sea glass and tools constrain choice and charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (protecting the shared "light" of connection) and escalate coherently under the accumulative lens through sensory and emotional intensification. The protagonist's agency drives the climax (building the cairn). Cost is legible in his confrontation and the receding cold. A minor weakness: the ghost's motivation ("ancient grief") is somewhat generic, slightly softening the antagonistic pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (human connection as a light against isolation and sorrow) emerges organically from the letters, the cairn, and the sea glass. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—Elias's defiant act and the "luminescent ache of human connection" reweight the prior darkness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elias's practical yet perceptive consciousness. The prose has a distinct, rhythmic texture that modulates with pressure ("The darkness here had weight and intention"). No head-hopping or voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong rhythmic control. A minor artifact: a slight filter-verb stack ("Elias could hear," "Elias felt") in the opening beats slightly dulls immediacy, preventing a higher score despite exceptional clarity and momentum elsewhere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a haunted lighthouse and an anonymous letter chain feels fresh and organic. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking (lyric compression, the cairn as a non-verbal message) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
