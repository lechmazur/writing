<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and deepens under pressure, compelling her high-stakes choice to enter the cave. Her final renunciation as a keeper is earned by her discovery. A slight deduction for a minor diagnostic label ("she understood") at the climax, which briefly abstracts an embodied realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through layered imagery to a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the shift from pilot to guardian is legible and charged by the final image of the warm arrow tip. The inverted gravity event is a brilliant situational pressure that forces the revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice (navigating by water flow) and charging the final image (the geode chamber). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action and perception, creating a profound and coherent atmosphere. The floating arches and whirling silence are not just backdrop but active elements of the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the situational pressure of inverted gravity, which coherently tightens tactics and forces a stance crystallization. However, the discovery of the arrow tip and the cave feels slightly convenient, a complication that enables rather than one earned through active struggle, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the climax: resilience as a cycle to be protected, not a thing to be owned. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing. The integration of the probe's backstory is efficient and thematically rich.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature. The prose rhythm modulates beautifully with the scene's pressure, from the frantic inversion to the awe-filled silence of the geode. Purposeful elision (e.g., the probe's origin) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language ("petrified worms," "dancing stars") is precise and purposeful, enhancing rather than obscuring clarity. No loops, scaffold, or artifacting. Sentence-level rhythm is masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a silicate-grass planet, inverted gravity, and a time-battery geode is fresh and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded choices in character and world, avoiding cliché. A bold, singular vision.</comment>
