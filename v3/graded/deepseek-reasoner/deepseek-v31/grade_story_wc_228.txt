<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's interior contradiction is rendered with precise, embodied emotion; his final renunciation is earned by the seashell's discovery, which reconfigures his relationship to his past with visible cost. The micro-choice to leave the shell behind crystallizes his acceptance of "temporary eternity."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: the cracked mirror motivates the drive, the wrong turn leads to the cave, and the discovery of the shell forces the climactic realization. Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with the cost legible in "The memory of Mara was no longer a weight but a landmark."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is not merely described but actively pressures choice and discovery; the luminous pool and stone plinth constrain the final act of leaving the shell, charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the causal lens, pressure escalates through a single, meaningful tightening: the discovery of the painted shell, a relic of his forgotten promise, forces a decisive re-evaluation of his entire life. The cost is the conscious renunciation of his old artistic project, a path foreclosed with felt weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of "temporary eternity" is fully integrated, emerging from the specific discovery of the shell and reconfiguring the meaning of his art without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the shell left on its "altar."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elias's perceptual signature; the prose rhythm modulates effectively under emotional pressure, particularly in the reflective cavern sequence. The voice is distinct and consistent, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentences like "He was a trespasser in time" are concise and potent. The final paragraph's cadence masterfully supports the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a nostalgic painter, a hidden painted shell, and the concept of "temporary eternity" feels organic and fresh. The risk of a symbolic object is justified by its causal role in the plot and its irreplaceable specificity, transforming a familiar trope.</comment>
