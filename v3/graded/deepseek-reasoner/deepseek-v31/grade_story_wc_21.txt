<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation evolves credibly from archival duty to a rescue mission, driven by embodied reactions to the vision and a micro-choice to arrange debris. Her final vow, "I WILL REMEMBER," is an earned endurance with visible cost, foreclosing her prior life of detached scholarship.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the archivist's mission is permanently altered, with cost legible in the "solemn heart" carrying the truth. The accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure escalates through pattern recognition (wind-arranged debris, glowing lagoon) leading to a decisive cadence shift and knowledge change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is indispensable, constraining the parley method and charging the final image with its transformation. Sensory details are purposefully selective, reflecting Elara's professional focus and the scene's urgency, from the "low thrum" of engines to the "sigh of the wind."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from academic discovery to a moral imperative through the protagonist's agency in initiating the silent dialogue. The cost is felt in the final, solemn ascent, a trade-off of her former detachment for the burden of carrying a murdered man's truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully from the parley itself, exploring history as a living, painful entity. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of truth versus official records through the final image of the truth being "carried" rather than simply recorded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's archival mindset, with a distinct perceptual signature ("sanctuary known as the Aero-scriptorium"). The prose rhythm masterfully modulates from the methodical cipher-breaking to the frantic, visionary peak and the solemn resolution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid without artifice, doing multiple jobs (e.g., "the airship’s shadow a vast, silent kite" establishes scale, tone, and metaphor). Sentence-level propulsion is flawless, accelerating through the reverie and calming at closure. No loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a civil-rights mystery with a supernatural parley mechanism is fresh and organic. The core concept of a consciousness fused with volcanic glass is a high-risk, specific choice that heightens stakes and coheres perfectly with the theme of indelible truth.</comment>
