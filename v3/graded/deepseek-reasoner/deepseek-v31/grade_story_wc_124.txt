<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elara's wistful empathy and Silas's guarded grief are embodied through specific micro-choices (offering the vial, removing his mask). Silas's final understanding is earned by the vial's revelation, with cost visible in his tears. A slight deduction for Silas's emotional shift from shock to understanding, which could be more embodied in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Elara's offer of the vial directly leads to the memory revelation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (CR) as the conceptual cost of buried joy is repriced, landing with undeniable force in the final image of Silas weeping for beauty. The persistent constraint of his grief shapes the entire tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse and ultraviolet lamps are not just backdrop; they constrain the action and charge the final image, their "crystal shadows" becoming the canvas for the memory. Sensory detail is purposefully selective, reflecting the POV's professional focus (e.g., "specific ultraviolet spectrum," "aromatic caution").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (understanding grief) and escalate through a single, meaningful tightening: the decision to use the vial. This choice narrows options, forcing the confrontation with the memory. The cost is the profound emotional reconfiguration, legible on the page in Silas's weeping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the specific action of the vial revealing memory, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—that memory preserves love—through the final image of "fragrant, undeniable proof." The conceptual repricing is earned, not stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a wistful, perceptive narrative voice. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Silas's plea, Elara's explanation). The prose has a controlled, lyrical rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion. One minor rhythm stumble in the long sentence describing the emerged scent ("a complex emission of...") slightly slows momentum, preventing a higher score. Otherwise, clean and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lantern broker, memory-extracting light, and a greenhouse for extinct plants is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through character-specific choices, not used as mere ornament.</comment>
