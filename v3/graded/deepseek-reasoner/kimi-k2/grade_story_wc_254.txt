<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("Tears crystallized on her lashes"). The final choice to walk onto the water is earned by prior causality (paraphrasing the ban, syncing with the quartz) and carries visible cost (the colonnade dims, a path is foreclosed). The poet's "aesthetically driven" trait consistently motivates higher-stakes choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through pattern breaks (paraphrasing the ban, the lake melting from the bottom) that reweight the dominant stake (boundary dissolution) with cost. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she becomes "both inside and outside, above and below, poet and poem," with cost legible in the colonnade dimming and the lake's reflection changing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The quartz colonnade and frozen lake are indispensable, constraining choice (the pillar recognizes her pulse) and charging the final image (the lake reflecting "migrating constellations"). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("lantern-moth hush," "breath frosting"). The setting evolves causally with events (the lake melts from the bottom).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: her choice to paraphrase the ban triggers a series of pattern breaks (colonnade dimming, boundaries dissolving) that narrow options and reweight the stake. The cost is unmistakable (the colonnade's task is complete, it dims to ember). A single meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of boundary dissolution emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("the echo is already home") that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in implication (the ban was about symmetry, not speech). Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars (the quartz's hum syncing with her pulse).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure ("Words pooled in her mouth, tasting of iron and snow"). POV is stable and apt. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping. The voice is singular and coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("borders are only weather in slow motion" → "the mirror’s refusal to flip"). No loops or scaffold. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally and supports pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of boundary dissolution, poetic creation, and symmetry feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (lyric mode, abstract concepts) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise offers a fresh angle on censorship and art. Authenticity of vision is undeniable.</comment>
