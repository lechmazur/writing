<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies, with embodied emotion and a credible final renunciation. However, the final choice, while earned, lacks a distinctly visible, on-page cost that would elevate it to the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building meaning through pattern and cadence. A slight ambiguity in the final transition from the memory spiral to the tea house prevents a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating tea house and morpho wing are not just vivid but essential, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and purposeful, fully integrated into the POV's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the accumulative lens, with a clear deepening as he deciphers the wing and steps into memory. The cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page, which prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of storytelling as resonance emerges organically from the particulars of the wing and the donor heart. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a rich perceptual signature. The prose's lyrical compression is taught early and pays off at closure. The single, brief line of dialogue is perfectly integrated and functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor risk of overwriting in the peak beat ("color rippling like a shout held underwater") slightly tempers the score, though clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise—a dye master reading a storyteller's life through a butterfly wing via sun trails—is a singular, high-risk synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. It fully commits to its unique logic and emotional truth.</comment>
