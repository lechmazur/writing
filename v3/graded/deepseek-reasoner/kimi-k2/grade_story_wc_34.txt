<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion ("throat tightened") and micro-choices (painting the door) that reveal hierarchy of values. The final choice to sing is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the dissolution of the ghost and the weight of articulated needs. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (ghost becomes harmony) landing with felt cost ("silence was different now—full instead of empty"). Orientation is clear by ~120 words. The persistent constraint of the bolt plate shapes tactics and final image, with cost legible in the transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (courtyard above clouds, bolt plate) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("mist bead on the wet letters"), with spatial choreography coherent. The bolt plate functions as micro-setting, evolving through use and reweighting meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Lira's agency under accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in the ghost's dissolution and the humming weight of the bolt plate. Pressure coheres through density increase (graffiti encoding, painted door) that reweights the dominant stake of articulating needs. One meaningful tightening (ghost taking shape) forces stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to silence and articulation. Subtext operates in implication ("I was the song you stopped singing"), avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights prior material through music rather than memory, with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful compression and patterned diction ("driftingly alert"). POV is stable and apt, with voice modulating emotionally without head-hopping. Elision (e.g., ghost's origin) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion, zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("cloak dissolving into music"), without mixed metaphors. Syntax and rhythm vary naturally, accelerating with scene needs. Read-aloud test passes with flying colors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of fantasy and emotional realism, with the "tinkersong" concept feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific, verifiable detail (quicksilver paint, cloudbloom) creates freshness without quirkiness. Premise is fully committed and transformed through lived detail.</comment>
