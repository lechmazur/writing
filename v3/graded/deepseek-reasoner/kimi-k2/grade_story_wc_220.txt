<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied through sensory perception (bloodhound's "retired nostrils flare wider than ever before") and micro-choices under pressure. Grayson's actions reveal motive through concrete handling of the cylinder. The final renunciation of physical search for auditory connection is earned through prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the bloodhound's understanding of distance transforms into listening. Cost is legible in the final image: "lies down in the scraped earth to dream of paths that no longer need bodies." Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable and constrains every choice. The scrapyard settlement pressures perception ("tin roofs click like teeth"), and key objects (cylinder, leaf) charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the bloodhound's professional nose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation occurs through accumulative deepening of perception rather than plot turns. The dominant stake (translating distance into closeness) tightens through the cylinder's revelation, forcing a stance crystallization. Cost is felt in the bloodhound's final understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: memory as contour, beauty as pressure. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of spinning cylinders under starlight. No moralizing; complexity remains intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is perfectly stable and filtered through the bloodhound's sensory worldview. Voice is distinct with controlled rhythmic cadence ("sniffing the wild hush"). Purposeful compression and elision serve the accumulative design. No dialogue present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without losing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. No loops or scaffold. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic tropes through specific sensory perception. The conceit of reading history from cylinder grooves is fresh and irreplaceable. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
