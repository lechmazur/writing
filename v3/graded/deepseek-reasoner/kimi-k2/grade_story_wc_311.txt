<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The reaper's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, compelling his high-stakes choice to reclaim memory. Interiority is concrete and embodied (e.g., "throat raw with memory," "hollow where his own heart used to beat"). His final renunciation—internalizing the names as a form of endurance—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as the crystallized names sink into his chest. A hairline deduction for a minor diagnostic label ("heartbroken" is stated, though richly dramatized).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, with pressure building through layered imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on the page with cost: the names become "second heartbeats," reconfiguring his purpose. The lens holds; the observatory and prism constrain tactics. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The observatory and broken prism are micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "frost that had never known a living footstep," "smell of brine and lullabies"). The environment evolves causally, with the prism's light exhaustion mirroring the reaper's emotional shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the reaper's agency under the Accumulative lens: his alignment of the prism deepens the stake from naming to internalizing sacrifice. Cost is legible as the atlas page darkens and the names etch into his hollow ribs. One meaningful tightening—the crystallization—forecloses his path of mere remembrance, forcing endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action: naming as forgiveness, memory as endurance. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"I name you, and in naming, I keep you"—that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., sea monsters as sacrifices shaped by terror).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("constellations wheeled like slow clock hands"). Diction and syntax reflect the reaper's timeless perspective. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., the nature of his reaperhood) is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is pattern-taught and functional (e.g., "syllable an orphaned ghost"). No loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports momentum. A minor deduction for one potentially mixed metaphor ("echo trembled in the rafters" slightly clashes with celestial setting).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of reaper, cartography, and sacrifice feels fresh and inevitable. Specific, grounded choices (e.g., wax cylinders, sea monsters as sacrifices) avoid tropes. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through lived detail.</comment>
