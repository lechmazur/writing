<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion under pressure. Her final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost when she reads her own diary and accepts her role as courier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through layered discoveries to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with cost (tapestry dissolves, she stands empty-handed) and is legible. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, anchoring who, where, and when.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The silo library and tapestry fragment function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through Elara's perception. The environment evolves causally with events, such as the wall leaning closer and singing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the accumulative lens, probing deeper into diaries. A meaningful deepening occurs when she finds her own diary, changing her knowledge and forcing a final choice. Cost is legible when the tapestry dissolves and she stands empty-handed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the wall's whisper: "Stories are not chains but wings." Theme emerges from events and images, not direct statement, resisting tidy morals. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Diction remains within Elara's plausible lexicon, and prose reflects her mind state under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and clear propulsion. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence-level craft accelerates with scene needs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud test passes seamlessly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle with specific, grounded choices. The prophetic tapestry and displaced axis are transformed through lived detail and moral calculus. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
