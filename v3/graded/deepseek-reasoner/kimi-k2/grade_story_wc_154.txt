<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lin's characterization is exceptionally embodied and particular, with her translator's eye and sisterly guilt operating simultaneously under pressure. The brain coral fragment evolves from personal totem to communal offering, demonstrating a micro-choice hierarchy with visible cost. Minor deduction for slightly over-articulated interiority ("shrewdly innocent" feels diagnostic) in an otherwise flawless portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pattern density (coral, codes, mist) escalating toward a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The coral's transfer to the garden and the decrypted message scored in her palm provide undeniable conceptual cost. Every element tightens the central stake of translating trauma into meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as both atmosphere and crucible, with the coral fragment as micro-setting constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details (iodine, plaster ridges, geckos holding breath) are filtered through Lin's professional and emotional priorities with masterful economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through density increases (decryption, coral weight, surgical outcome) that reweight the dominant stake of healing through translation. Lin's agency in decrypting and offering the coral forces a trade-off with visible cost, narrowing options toward the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the coral's transformation from dead lattice to potential growth, offering a non-literal answer to trauma without moralizing. The final image of polyps blooming as "small brave words" achieves profound conceptual repricing through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains a distinct perceptual signature blending clinical precision and lyrical depth throughout. The decryption passage ("unknot the pattern") demonstrates perfect syntactic control under pressure. Minor deduction for occasional dense metaphors that slightly challenge immediacy without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits exceptional density and rhythmic control, though occasional figurative stacking ("stomach fold like wet paper") creates mild compression in high-pressure beats. No loops or scaffolding artifacts; every sentence advances character and atmosphere. The closure image lands with perfect clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of war trauma, medical drama, and ecological metaphor feels inevitable and transformative. The brain coral as both personal worry stone and communal seed represents genuine risk-taking that heightens stakes without gimmickry. Specificity anchors universal themes completely.</comment>
