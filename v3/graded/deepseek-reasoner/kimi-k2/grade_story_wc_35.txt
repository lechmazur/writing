<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure (licking the broth to subsume the memory) revealing her hierarchy of values. Her competence is balanced with genuine struggle, and the final choice carries visible cost. The one minor flaw is a slight diagnostic tinge in "emotionally contagious residue," but it's quickly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with density increasing through sensory details and pattern breaks (the salt flowers crystallizing) that reweight the dominant stake of processing remorse. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear cost: the lord smiles without tears, and the fortress walls stop weeping.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is not merely vivid but actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The coral pavilion, the tidal pool, and the copper pot are all micro-settings that shape Lira's tactics. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and filtered through her professional POV, creating a fully integrated environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the Accumulative lens. The stake of transforming remorse is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when she chooses to taste the broth, a decision that narrows her options and carries a palpable risk of being drowned by the emotion. The cost is legible in the crystallization of salt flowers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of metabolizing grief emerges organically from concrete actions and images, resisting tidy morals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "ocean-sweet" flavor of the stew, which carries only an echo of loss. The concept of stored remorse is fully integrated into the narrative's logic and emotional arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice has a distinct, controlled perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure. The prose is purposefully compressed and lyrical, with a rhythmic cadence that supports the accumulative mode. There is no head-hopping or register drift, though the highly stylized diction occasionally flirts with overwriting without crossing the line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though it occasionally leans into slight overwriting ("an emotionally contagious residue"). Rhythm is expertly controlled, and sentences consistently advance multiple elements of the story. A minor deduction for a cluster of complex metaphors in high-pressure beats, but clarity is never lost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a memory-tasting chef, a coral pavilion, and emotionally contagious remorse is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic, committing fully to its implications without retreat. A clear, singular artistic stance.</comment>
