<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the hospital marble moment. The final renunciation feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost when gravity returns. Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, though the initial "labyrinth of self" desire is slightly abstract until grounded by specific regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a decisive Conceptual Repricing: surrendering the thread (tablet) reconfigures her relationship with time and gravity. Cost is legible in the final lines with "each step heavier, each step hers." The pattern of the tablet's resetting and the viaduct's generation teaches its logic early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The viaduct and tablet are micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the POV's urgency. The hospital marble segment is a masterful use of a recurring object to crystallize the core conflict and cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift driven by protagonist agency. The density of regret increases, culminating in the hospital floor recognition, which forces the final choice. The cost of surrendering the compulsion to retrace is felt in the visceral return of gravity and memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete particular of the tablet and the act of retracing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: conquering the internal labyrinth requires surrender, not discovery. The final image of the "widening circle of now" reweights the prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are exceptional. The voice is consistent, poetic, and deeply fused with the POV's consciousness. Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., "the air folded like paper") are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistent, coherent, and heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. Sentence-level rhythm masterfully accelerates and breathes with the scene's needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a gravity defier, a resetting prophecy, and procedural generation feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotionally complex conclusion. The choice to center the climax on a hospital floor is a specific, non-obvious risk that heightens stakes.</comment>
