<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to higher-stakes choices like the parley. Her internal conflict is embodied and concrete, particularly when she feels the poet's fear braid with her own resolve. The final renunciation is earned, transforming retrocognitive hold into responsibility. A minor deduction for a slight lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where two women are joined by the act of naming, with clear cost felt in the responsibility Elara accepts. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure building through density of imagery and a decisive cadence shift. The environment itself becomes an active participant, turning the dunes into pages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is not merely described; it constrains choice and decisively charges the final image, rising through the sand to mirror Elara's pattern and becoming the literal map to the graves. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully filtered through Elara's professional and emotional priorities, making the setting a crucible for the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the Accumulative lens, her act of parley ("Nimue, I am here to listen") serving as the decisive tightening that unlocks the diary and floods her with the poet's final moment. The cost is legible on the page as she staggers but continues, her actions forcing the environment to respond and reveal the truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of buried truth refusing to stay hidden emerges entirely through events and images, most powerfully in the final image of the lagoon reflecting both women. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the act of naming, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The concept of tension between loss and memory is fully integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in the searing reverie where past and present overlap. The voice is consistently character-specific, with a perceptual signature that notices like an archivist ("cross-referencing microfiche and whispered testimonies"). Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density, often doing multiple jobs ("the dunes themselves became pages turning"). A very minor deduction for a moment of potential register drift ("memory made liquid") in a high-pressure beat, though it remains largely legible and voice-motivated. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a floating library, retrocognitive magic, and a political archive feels fresh and organic, not a checklist. The core premise is fully committed to and its implications are followed through to a powerful, inevitable-feeling closure. The specific, grounded choice of using beach debris to decipher a metaphysical cipher is a significant risk that pays off.</comment>
