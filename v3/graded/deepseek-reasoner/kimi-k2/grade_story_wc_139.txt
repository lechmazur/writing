<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lila's characterization is rich with embodied contradiction (eagerness for moral balance warring with complicit guilt) and micro-choices under pressure (counting heartbeats, the pivot to deception). The final endurance is earned by her father's taught causality, though the father's off-page presence limits full relationship-as-crucible pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred causal lens holds tightly: Lila's goal (get the seal) drives because/therefore linkages that narrow options. Closure is a decisive change (certificate stamped) with resonant reconfiguration (her conceptual repricing of "fairness"); cost is legible in the final image of the equation she "could not yet solve."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prep room is a masterclass in micro-setting that constrains choice (the director's return forces the breach) and charges the final image (the "deathly vitality" performing a "slow duet"). Sensory details (formaldehyde, iron/violet scent) are filtered through Lila's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lila's agency under the causal lens: her active waiting creates the breach, and her slide of the certificate forces the irreversible stamp. The cost of her complicity is felt in the trade calculation ("minus the weight of her complicity") and the final, unresolved equation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the ink pot's reweighted meaning—from tool of forgery to instrument of asylum—culminating in the final, non-literal answer: "fairness was not a number but a process, a continuous revision of borders." The moral calculus avoids tidy resolution, lingering in ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends the clinical ("borrowed dignity") and the poetic ("pale ink across the city"). The director's dialogue is minimal but goal-driven, carrying subtext of suspicion fatigued into compliance. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density ("a black suspension that seemed to breathe") and varied rhythm. One minor loop occurs ("one death equals one life, plus the ink of forgiveness" slightly paraphrases prior math), but it serves thematic resonance rather than obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a forged death certificate in a funeral home to grant asylum is a fresh, non-obvious angle. The ink pot transforms from a trope (inherited object) into a central, irreplaceable mechanism of plot and theme. The story commits fully to its morally complex premise.</comment>
