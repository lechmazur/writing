<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Historian's motivation is clear and embodied through sensory details like veil fluttering "like a wounded moth." Her final choice to sing and accept raw grief is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her tears mixing with liquid light. Minor deduction for slightly abstract motivation phrasing early on.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through layered imagery to Conceptual Repricing closure. The final image of holding the original prism while the pagoda crumbles carries undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and pattern-teaching is consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is fully integrated and constrains choices throughout, particularly the "steadily unpredictable" architecture and floor-tile stepping method. The bronze prism pagoda charges the final image decisively. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, with excellent POV filtering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation builds through accumulative density toward the memory core confrontation. Protagonist agency drives the climax through her decision to sing, which cracks the core and releases the storm of light. Cost is legible in her weeping and the archive's collapse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the historian's journey from purification as cleansing to clarification. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about memory's complexity through the image of "saffron and smoke." No moralizing or thematic echo in final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with consistent POV filtering. Lyric compression is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Syntax and rhythm modulate effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the climax. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, though slight over-density in peak beats ("liquid light," "dying star," "phosphorescent blood") causes minor rhythmic compression. No loops or template cadence issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory, nostalgia, and historical purification concepts. The "atoms of nostalgia" premise is transformed through specific world-building and character journey. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
