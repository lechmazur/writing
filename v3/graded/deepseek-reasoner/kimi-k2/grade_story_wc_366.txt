<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's reticence and practical competence are embodied through micro-choices (stacking stones, distilling the feeling into the flask). His internal conflict between tides and ghosts is dramatized, and his final vow is earned by prior causality. The widow's presence, while spectral, applies immediate pressure that forces his stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the final image of the flask and note reconfiguring Elias's role from ferryman to keeper. The cost is legible in the line "letting it settle like sediment in a jar." The lens holds, and the anonymous letter chain provides a coherent, taught pattern that pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The lantern room functions as a micro-setting that directly pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Elias's professional POV (e.g., "grammar of balance and silence"). The sea glass and stones are recurring objects that constrain choice and evolve in meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through a cadence shift from practical duty to emotional guardianship, reweighting the dominant stake of safety. The widow's presence and the letter's plea force a stance crystallization from Elias, moving from silent reply to a spoken vow, with the cost of taking on another's ache made visible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of guardianship and transmitted solace emerges organically from the letter chain, the stacking stones, and the final act of bottling the "feeling of safety." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the image of the flask marked "Return."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with a controlled perceptual signature ("the air tasted of salt and lilacs"). POV is stable and deeply embedded in Elias's consciousness. The single line of dialogue is earned and character-specific, serving as a peak action that advances the plot and theme.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional. Prose is dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("a throat that had swallowed the moon"). Rhythm varies effectively with scene needs, and there are no observable artifacts, loops, or scaffold sentences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a pragmatic lighthouse keeper, a ghostly widow, and an anonymous letter chain feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through to its logical, emotionally complex conclusion, transforming familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices and a singular voice.</comment>
