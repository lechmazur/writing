<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the opening and the handling of the gnomon. The final choice to take soil is a micro-choice revealing a hierarchy of values with visible cost, earned by prior causality. The "warmly curious" trait is not just a label but enables her to enter the orchard, constraining action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant and holds, building through sensory and symbolic density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with undeniable conceptual cost in the final image of the orchard and the portable soil. The persistent constraint of the sundial's broken state shapes tactics and charges the final act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful (e.g., "motes of bone dust that rose and fell like slow applause"). The environment is a micro-setting that pressures the protagonist's actions and is inextricable from the thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a single, meaningful deepening as she excavates and rebuilds. The cost is legible on the page in the final image of her carrying "a portable orchard of reconciled histories," a forfeiture that forecloses other paths. The dominant stake of restoring faith is tested and reweighted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of faith and return through the final image of the sundial and the portable soil. Theme emerges organically from events and images, resisting tidy morals. The realization that faith is "a process—roots wrapping gently around what remains" is earned through specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are maintained under pressure. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that is consistent and voice-motivated. Purposeful elision (e.g., the seven days) is taught and pays off, compressing time to serve the accumulative design without harming closure legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density with clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing rather than obscuring clarity (e.g., "knitting fleshless memories to living bark"). Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally and supports the accumulative, lyrical mode. Read-aloud quality is exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of diaspora return, archeology, and cyclical time feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept of "interrupted journeys" is transformed through grounded, particular detail and a singular artistic stance.</comment>
