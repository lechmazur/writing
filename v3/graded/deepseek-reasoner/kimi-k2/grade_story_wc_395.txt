<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in personal loss, compelling her high-stakes choice to lie and steal the drive. Her interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("heart beat the same rhythm as the servers: 117, 117, 117"). The final choice to become a wanderer feels earned by prior causality, foreclosing her old life with a visible cost. A slight deduction for the climax's emotional calibration feeling slightly tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is strong, with the recurring number 117 building pattern and pressure toward a resonant reconfiguration closure. The final image of Mara as a wanderer carries conceptual cost and reweights the premise. The orientation is immediate, and the closure lands on the page. The arrival of the demolition crew at 0117 hours is a slightly convenient pressure point, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The social network archive is a vivid, purpose-driven setting that pressures choices and supplies key clues. The mission patch is a brilliant micro-setting object that constrains choice (she uses it to store data) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional POV, creating a cohesive, chilling atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the deepening pattern of 117, narrowing Mara's options and culminating in the timed threat of decommission. Her agency is clear in lying and stealing the drive, a choice that forecloses a path with cost. The stakes—saving memory from oblivion—are visceral and consistently high throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges elegantly from the core concept of deleted memory, explored through specific events and the central metaphor of song. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("they travel in song") that reweights prior material without moralizing. The integration of the lullaby motif is organic and deeply tied to character and stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, poetic texture with a controlled, rhythmic cadence that supports the melancholic tone. POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mara's perception. The occasional complex syntax is voice-motivated and legible, though a few sentences in the climax verge on over-densification, slightly obscuring immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and vivid, purposeful imagery. The prose is largely clear and propulsive. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "silence that tasted of sensed absence"), creating momentary density that slightly slows momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a corporate archive, a missing persons case, and the metaphysics of deleted data feels fresh and specific. The concept is fully committed to and followed to its poignant conclusion. The recurring number motif is transformed from a trope into a meaningful pattern that drives the plot and deepens the theme.</comment>
