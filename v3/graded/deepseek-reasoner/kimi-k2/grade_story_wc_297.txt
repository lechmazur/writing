<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and her "purposefully curious" nature drives her choices. Her final sacrifice of memories is earned by the scene's causality, with a visible cost. A slight deduction for a moment of abstract interiority ("asking what dreams might still intersect") that feels slightly diagnostic rather than fully embodied in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with density and pattern (scars, light, dreams) intensifying to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands on the page with clear cost (surrendered memories) and reconfigures the world's state. A minor -0.1 for a slight lens ambiguity mid-story, but the closure is legible and powerful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt glade and glass-grass are vividly rendered and integral to the plot, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Lyra's perception. The setting evolves causally with events and is a key agent in the story's resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the outset. Escalation is driven by Lyra's agency under the Accumulative lens, culminating in the high-cost choice to surrender her memories. The pressure coheres and the cost of her lost dreams is legible and felt, decisively reweighting the narrative's options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of broken covenants and stolen futures. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of Lyra as the new guardian. It embraces complexity without moralizing, and the final lines powerfully reweight the prior material without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature. The prose's lyrical, compressed quality is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative mode. POV is stable and the diction remains within Lyra's plausible lexicon, even under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly evocative with strong rhythmic control. There is a potential minor paraphrase loop between "abandoned futures" and "futures too impatient to wait," but it does not obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and advances the story. Information density is exceptionally high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, specific synthesis of ecological and personal fantasy. The core concept of an "eclipsed covenant" is transformed through grounded, particular details and a non-obvious moral calculus. The risk-taking in its lyrical compression heightens stakes without becoming a gimmick.</comment>
