<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., pressing the stencil, threading beads for mulch). The final renunciation of mourning for cultivation is earned by prior causality. The AI caretaker applies secondary pressure but remains a tool for the protagonist's arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern breaks (cranes illuminating, constellations rearranging) reweight the stake with cost. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis as gardener of the possible) with felt cost legible in the locket buried and hands full of seeds. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (polishing lenses, using instruments) and charging the final image (vines climbing the tripod). Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("velvet panels embroidered with star charts", "scent of damp earth"). The observatory functions as a crucible and micro-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: her actions (folding cranes, using the stencil) trigger the deepening that reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the burial of the locket and the transformation of purpose. One meaningful cadence shift is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images ("grief was a lens"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("To mourn is to cultivate; to remember is to illuminate") that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("the great dome opened like a pupil dilated by grief"). Diction is controlled and purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity. The AI's single line of dialogue carries subtext and advances the plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without obscuring clarity. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("subdued ardor made visible"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. Minor density in peak beats is functional and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief, astronomy, and cultivation feels inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking (lyric compression, AI caretaker) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The final image is bold and coherent.</comment>
