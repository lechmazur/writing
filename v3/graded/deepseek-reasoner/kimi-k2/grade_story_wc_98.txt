<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear, rooted, and intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict—doubting the luminous things she loves to save them—is embodied and contradictory, driving her to a credible, earned renunciation. The final choice to bite the fruit is a micro-choice revealing her hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through pattern breaks (forgetting flowers) and a decisive cadence shift into the dream. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the memories root, reconfiguring the stakes with a felt cost: the "luminous doubt" still flickering in her eyes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, functioning as a character that pressures choices and supplies resources. The ridge, the monsoon, and the seed itself constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered entirely through Mira's professional and personal priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: the accelerating forgetting forces Mira to adapt her tactics, culminating in the dream-summoning of witnesses. The cost is unmistakable on the page in the final image of "luminous doubt," the price paid for her empirical whimsy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of memory versus doubt emerges organically from events and images, resisting tidy resolution. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: memory is saved but must be questioned to stay alive, a complexity embodied in the final image of "luminous doubt."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a compelling perceptual signature. The prose's lyrical, precise texture reflects Mira's mind and state, modulating under pressure without losing coherence. Purposeful compression and elision (the dream sequence) are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, though a minor muddle occurs with "raindrops the size of lullabies," slightly straining the established physical logic of the dream.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of fantasy and memory is specific, non-obvious, and feels inevitable. The core premise is fully committed to and transformed through grounded, lived detail (e.g., tasting a story's pH). Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
