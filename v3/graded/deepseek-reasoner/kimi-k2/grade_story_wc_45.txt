<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ivy's characterization is masterfully integrated through concrete micro-choices (lifting the tooth with surgical tweezers, humming lullabies) that reveal her "forgiving skeptic" nature. Her final choice to heal the skeleton is earned by prior causality, with the cost of her shattered certainty made palpable. The trait "shrewdly innocent" is embodied in her actions, not just stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) as the skeleton dissolves into a new constellation, reweighting the premise of mistakes with undeniable conceptual cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, with imagery and motifs tightening toward this final, cost-laden image. The garden's sealing provides a felt sense of loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purpose-driven, with the yew roots, maze, and secret garden acting as a crucible that pressures choices. The marble bench's inscription is a superb, charging detail. The grade is capped as the hedge maze itself, while atmospheric, does not ultimately constrain a choice as heavily as the garden and the tooth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly under the accumulative lens from discovery to confrontation to transformation. Ivy's agency drives each beat: choosing to follow the rumor, to ask to see the original child, and to perform the bone-setting ritual. The cost is legible in the "cleft in certainty" that widens into "possibility," a traded worldview.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of transforming guilt into guidance emerges organically from the specific, earned action of turning a skeleton into starlight. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The concept of a "cleft in certainty" is fully integrated into the narrative's logic and closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is exceptional, with a distinct perceptual signature ("the nostalgic scent of bruised roses") and controlled, rhythmic prose that modulates perfectly with emotional intensity. POV is stable and deeply filtered through Ivy's professional and compassionate worldview. The dialogue is sparse but carries immense subtext and goal pursuit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is flawless, with high information density and zero artifacts. Every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("the cleft in certainty open inside her like a fault line"). Rhythm is varied and propulsive, particularly in the climactic ritual paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of veterinary realism with changeling folklore feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of mistakes as constellations is a non-obvious, ingenious inflection that is fully committed to and paid off. The story takes the bold risk of a quiet, transformative climax and executes it with conceptual integrity.</comment>
