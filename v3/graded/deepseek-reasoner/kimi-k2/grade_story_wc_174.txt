<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lucien's serene composure is a consistent, character-particular trait that enables his performance and is rooted in his backstory of complicity. His micro-choices—reversing the puppet, inviting participation—reveal a clear hierarchy of values. The final choice to confess and invite collaboration is earned by the scene's causality. The supporting cast applies immediate, relevant pressure, though their interiorities are secondary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through layered images and reconfiguring meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the audience's participation projects a new, collaborative story, reweighting the premise of ethical storytelling with undeniable conceptual cost. The pattern is taught early and pays off. The orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is indispensable, its residual electronics causing the stick's epiphanies to glow and its curved wall serving as the puppet screen. The setting actively constrains and enables the performance, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and filtered through the POV's professional priorities (e.g., "scent of ozone," "ticking of cooling metal").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification through the density of the puppet show's images, which reweights the dominant stake of ethical storytelling. The cost is legible in the audience's transformed reactions (pilot's tears). The protagonist's agency drives the escalation through his performance and final invitation, forcing a stance crystallization in his listeners.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of ethical storytelling emerges organically from the specific, dramatized event of the puppet show and Lucien's confession. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of collaborative projection, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the puppet show's mirrored actions and the final, wordless contributions of the audience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable, controlled, and deeply integrated with Lucien's calligraphic perception. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with a strong perceptual signature ("mascara had streaked like comet tails"). Purposeful elision (the audience's exact words) is taught and pays off in their physical contributions. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a potential register drift in the final line fragment, which slightly obscures the closure image's clarity compared to the story's otherwise impeccable concrete action. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a calligrapher's puppet show in a radar dome to explore ethical storytelling is a fresh, non-obvious, and fully committed concept. The combination feels organic and inevitable, not a checklist. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, creating a singular artistic stance.</comment>
