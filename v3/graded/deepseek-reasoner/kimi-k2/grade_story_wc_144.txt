<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her blindness and maternal history informing every micro-choice. Her motivation is clear and intensifies under the ticking clock, compelling higher-stakes actions. The final endurance (waiting) feels earned by her prior struggle and visible cost. A minor lack of overt internal conflict in the peak beat prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through sensory density and the Orion's departure. Closure is a resonant Charged Poise, with cost legible in the final image of her tracing ripples and humming. The orientation is immediate and precise, and the taught pattern of light/water/sound pays off decisively at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot and water basin are not just atmospheric but actively constrain and enable Mara's choices, charging the final image. Sensory details are exquisitely selective and filtered through her unique perception (warmth on cheeks, water's song). The setting is indispensable to the plot's mechanics and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (rescue) is signaled early and escalates cleanly through the Orion's imminent departure, a coherent external pressure that forces stance crystallization. Mara's agency in patching the drone under this pressure is the central, driving action. The cost is felt in her raced final movements and the silent rise of the anchor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of repair, loss, and guidance, culminating in the resonant final image of the shop as a "lantern." The lullaby reprise and the concept of "every patch was a promise kept" offer a non-literal, deeply felt answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature shaped by Mara's blindness. The prose rhythm is masterfully controlled, modulating with urgency. Purposeful elision (we never see the daughter or survey team) serves the accumulative pattern and is paid off at closure. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language ("low magnetic calm," "shattered rainbow") is precise and purposeful, never muddy. Sentence-level propulsion is flawless, accelerating with the whistle. There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that obscure cause and effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A remarkably fresh and specific synthesis of elements—a blind artisan in a magnetic depot using hydromancy to repair a drone—feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through with impeccable logic and emotional truth. The risk-taking with sensory POV heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
