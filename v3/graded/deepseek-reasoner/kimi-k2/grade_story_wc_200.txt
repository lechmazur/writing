<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The collector's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure (offering her palm, pressing the tooth) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her emotional progression from weight to lightness feels earned through causality, and her final words mark a credible, cost-paid change. The only minor limitation is that her "modest fearlessness" is more stated than dramatically tested in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid) where the collector is lightened and the gorge is retuned, with cost felt in her dissolved knot and the musician's transparency. The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, building through layered imagery and confessions to a decisive cadence shift. The final note and integrated laughter provide undeniable conceptual and emotional cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The Echo Gorge is indispensable, functioning as a character that pressures choices and supplies the core mechanic of the misaligned harp. Vivid, purposeful sensory details (mica like spilled starlight, wind as a plectrum) are filtered through the POV and constrain the action. The setting decisively charges the final image with the "luminous ache" of the ignited mica.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a masterful density increase and cadence shift, reweighting the dominant stake of integration. The collector's agency—uncorking vials, offering the tooth—drives the climax. The cost is legible in the emptied vials and her loosened chest, making the resolution earned and the stakes visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of laughter, grief, and healing, resisting moralizing for a resonant, non-literal answer. The final image of the gorge blazing with "luminous ache" perfectly encapsulates the theme's complexity. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image, like the musician's hollow eyes and hurtful smile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, precise perceptual signature that remains stable under pressure. The prose is consistently filtered through the collector's consciousness, and the sparse dialogue ("Thank you for the song") carries immense subtext and purpose. The patterned elision of her name is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is flawless, with high information density, rhythmic control, and zero artifacts. Figurative language ("harp strung with moonlight," "grief distilled") is coherent, vivid, and advances the story. Sentence-level propulsion is impeccable, varying syntax to accelerate and breathe with the scene's needs. A masterclass in line-level craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise of a soul collector retuning a gorge of echoes is strikingly original and fully committed to. The synthesis of the crocodile's tooth, the boatman's laughter, and the musician's story feels inevitable in hindsight. The specific, grounded choices in character and world elevate a familiar trope into a singular, memorable vision.</comment>
