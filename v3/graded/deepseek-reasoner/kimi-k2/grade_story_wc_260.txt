<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure revealing her hierarchy of values. Her final stance crystallization—vigilance wrapped in tenderness—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when she sheds the need to be "purely good." The only minor flaw is a slight delay in fully anchoring her professional role, but this does not touch the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands with undeniable cost, crystallizing Mara's new stance. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. The final image of the star refusing to fade charges the closure. A very slight orientation delay (benefactor's role) is waived as it serves the reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The misty workshop and chameleon tail tip function as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through Mara's professional POV. The skylight framing the star is a perfect example of environment shaping the closure's meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a decisive cadence shift when Mara chooses to report the crime yet shield the chameleons. The cost is unmistakable on the page in her shedding of layers and acceptance of regret. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of balancing compassion and self-respect without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the tail's reconstruction and the code name "Mirage." The final image reweights prior material with profound ambiguity and cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. The prose has a textured, lyrical quality that remains character-bound and purposeful. Elision is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping or register drift. Diction remains within Mara's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and precise, with high information density and clear propulsion. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats ("shimmering stillness" appears twice), but it does not obscure closure clarity or cause a coherence break.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of wildlife crime, regenerative science, and emotional resilience feels fresh and inevitable. The specific, grounded choice to reconstruct a tail tip transforms a familiar trope of healing into a potent act of defiance. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
