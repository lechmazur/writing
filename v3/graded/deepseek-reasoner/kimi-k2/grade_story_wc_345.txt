<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Luma's altruism is a consistent, embodied core that drives the plot, and Kiran's transformation from isolated child to leader is earned through specific on-page choices like tracing the chalk and ringing the bell. The final collective effort is a credible, earned endurance that forecloses the path of solitude with a visible cost—Luma's dissolution. The secondary characters (mechanic, twins, archivist) apply immediate, relevant pressure without muddying the single-POV focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The inferred drive lens is Causal, with clear because/therefore linkages: the chalk messages cause Kiran's investigation, which leads to finding the bell, which draws the community, which enables the final plan. Closure is a decisive change (the nebula is anchored, the arches are saved) with a resonant reconfiguration (Luma becomes the perpetual dew) and a profound, felt cost—her final dissolution. The orientation is immediate and the pattern is taught and paid off flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is not just vivid but essential; the floating arches crack, pressuring the action, and the nebula is the central stake whose mechanics shape the final plan. The watering bell is a key object that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through a ghost's perception (e.g., "translucent hands brushing the petals").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: Kiran's choice to follow the chalk and ring the bell directly narrows options and raises the stakes, drawing others and enabling the final, costly plan. The dominant stake (planetary survival) is signaled early and tightens through the visible cracking of the arches and thinning of the nebula. The cost is legible in the collective fatigue and Luma's ultimate sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The theme of "family is the orchard we choose to tend" emerges organically from the specific, earned reunion of strangers and Luma's final message, not direct statement. The core concept (nebula of respite) integrates fully with this theme through the plot. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable, with a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure. The prose rhythm is controlled and purposeful, modulating with the emotional intensity of the climax. The single POV is maintained with clean focalization, and the voice is singular and memorable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally clean, with high information density and rhythmic control. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences are purposeful and advance the story, as seen in the climax: "The nebula of respite descended like a slow-motion waterfall, pouring through the arches and into the bell’s open mouth." Read-aloud rhythm is flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghost, a sci-fi orchard planet, and chalk messages feels fresh and inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic, avoiding stock metaphors. The emotional truth of found family and sacrifice feels singular and authentic, not a stitched response to a prompt.</comment>
