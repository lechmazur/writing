<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobia is embodied ("lungs tighten like fists") and her motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in familial loss. Her "prudently adventurous" nature is demonstrated through on-page micro-choices like counting steps and measuring angles under pressure. The final choice to fuse the compass halves is earned by prior causality and carries the visible cost of her mother's fading presence, a poignant endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds: the organ's note causes the spatial shift, which causes the compass to spin, leading to the ghostly vision and the final choice. Closure is a Decisive Change (key fused, labyrinth exhales) with felt cost (mother's ghost fades). Orientation is clear within 120 words. The persistent constraint of the labyrinth's memory-driven design shapes the final tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is a crucible that actively constrains choice (corridors narrow, retreat seals) and charges the final image (starlight pools like water). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("damp flagstones," "pipes twisted into impossible spirals"). The organ and compass function as micro-settings that directly enable and shape the climax, making the environment indispensable to the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: Elara's choice to play the organ triggers the spatial mutiny, which narrows her options and reveals the ghosts. The cost is legible in the spectral cartographers' "hollow eyes" and the bittersweet cost of her mother's fleeting return and subsequent fade. A single, meaningful tightening—the sealing of the retreat—effectively raises the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and inheritance emerges organically through the compass twins and the ghostly cartographers. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the labyrinth is not malicious but mnemonic, "trying to return what it had taken." The final image of the "complete star-chart etched in light" reweights the premise without moralizing, achieving profound emotional and thematic closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Elara's perception, with a distinct perceptual signature ("constellations no longer visible from the surface"). The prose has a controlled, lyrical rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity without losing clarity. Purposeful compression (e.g., the mother's backstory) is effectively woven into the present action, tilting stance via concrete cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deduction for a slight register drift in "spatial mutiny," which feels slightly jargony for the POV's lexicon in a high-pressure beat. However, this is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure. Information density is excellent, and sentences advance multiple elements of story and atmosphere simultaneously.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a claustrophobic explorer, a magical cartographer's organ, and a labyrinth of memory feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "spatial mutiny" is transformed from a generic weird-fiction trope into a specific mechanism of grief and return. The story commits fully to its premise, and the final reconfiguration is both surprising and earned, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
