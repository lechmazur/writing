<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her telepathy and regret filtering perception. Her final choice to press the shard to her scar is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Contradictory impulses of closure-seeking and wound-opening are dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (returning the miracle) with undeniable cost (loss of telepathy, acceptance of silence). The hybrid (accumulative/causal) lens holds: plant whispers and coffee rings accumulate pressure, leading to a causal final act. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The tower, ivy, and hourglass are not just described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The ivy's mournful urging and the balcony's dawn light are integral to the climax. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Mara's specific perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens: Mara actively reads the coffee rings and heeds the plants' guidance. The dominant stake (releasing her brother's moment) tightens through these discoveries, culminating in a costly, decisive act that forecloses her telepathic connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of displaced miracles and the cost of closure emerges entirely through image and action, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the returned miracle and learned silence—that reweights the entire story without moralizing. Complexity is embraced through the brother's laughing memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Mara's telepathy. The prose's lyrical, precise rhythm modulates perfectly with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression (e.g., the brother's memory) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without artifice. Every sentence advances story or atmosphere; figurative language is coherent and potent ("meteor hush"). Rhythm is masterfully controlled, accelerating and breathing with the scene. Zero loops, scaffolds, or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of telepathy, displaced miracles, and plant communication feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotionally complex conclusion. Risk-taking in the lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
