<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The keeper's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (kneeling to study gaps, pacing to count vessels). His final acceptance of shared burden is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the wilting Edelweiss and the weight of the memories he now carries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the keeper accepts the shared burden, foreclosing his isolation with a felt cost. The final image of the lighthouse watching over "the living and the remembered" confirms the decisive change. Cost is legible in the wilting flower and the keeper's promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is integral, not decorative. The opal dock and mist actively pressure the keeper's investigation, erasing footprints and swallowing the horizon. The Edelweiss, a recurring object, charges the final image by crumbling as he writes, its alpine scent constraining his method of remembrance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift: the keeper's realization that her gesture was "bequeathal" not farewell deepens the stake from personal curiosity to a communal duty. This forces a stance crystallization, compelling him to actively anchor her memories, with cost visible in the scattering petals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of shared grief emerges organically from the keeper's concrete actions and the reweighted meaning of the Edelweiss. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to bear memory, avoiding moralizing. The final image reconfigures isolation as "witnessed" and "populated."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature ("bruised opal," "exhale whenever he breathes"). The lyrical, compressed prose is voice-motivated and pattern-taught, paying off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. One minor artifact: the phrase "softly persistent" is used twice, creating a slight template cadence, but it does not obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a nautical setting with an alpine flower and the concept of "borrowed memories" is specific and non-obvious. The core premise of transferring forgetting is transformed through grounded, tactile detail and a final image that feels inevitable, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
