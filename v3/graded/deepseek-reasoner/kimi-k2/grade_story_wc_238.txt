<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("voice roughened by sleepless nights and ether"). The exorcist's motivation intensifies under time pressure, compelling higher-stakes choices. Her final action (transferring apology residue to the tree) is a micro-choice revealing hierarchy of values with visible cost. The archivist applies immediate pressure as a secondary character, though his role is slightly functional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost ("stumps glistened like open mouths mid-phrase"). Orientation is immediate and precise ("sheet music archive at dawn"). The ghost's dissolution and the orchard's acceptance create a before/after change through pattern density and cadence shift rather than causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the archive and orchard constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through POV ("brittle scores," "salt rings"). The perfume bottle and requiem manuscript function as micro-settings that shape tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent with tactile environmental interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (delivering apology before destruction) escalates through time pressure and emotional deepening. The bulldozer deadline creates coherent pressure that forces stance crystallization. Protagonist agency drives escalation through the scent dissemination and metaphorical offering. Cost is legible in the "forgiven silence" and singing branches.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles emerges organically through events and images without direct statement. The apple-seed rest serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of forgiveness. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication ("tears, or something like them, pearled"). Emotional aftereffect lingers without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled rhythmic modulation ("a hush inside the crash"). POV is stable and apt, with voice consistency under pressure. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density with zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful throughout. Sentence-level propulsion varies effectively with scene needs. One minor register consideration in "ether" usage, but overall clarity and concision are exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of supernatural and emotional elements feels inevitable in hindsight. The gossip-column exorcist premise offers a fresh angle on redemption. Risk-taking in metaphorical resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific, verifiable detail creates authenticity of vision.</comment>
