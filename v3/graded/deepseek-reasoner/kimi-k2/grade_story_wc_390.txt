<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's "logically emotional" mind is a consistent, embodied trait that drives her unique approach to the crisis. Her micro-choices—kneeling, humming, guiding the vibration—reveal a hierarchy of values where technical competence serves profound empathy. The final renunciation (accepting the transformed key) is earned by her prior causality and carries the cost of release, not control.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure escalates through density of sensory and sonic patterns toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure is a decisive Charged Poise where grief is translated, not silenced, with cost legible in the key's melted state ("useless for any lock but perfect for memory"). Orientation is immediate and taught; the ritual's mechanics are coherent and payoff is undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the closure. It functions as a resonant chamber, its physical properties ("ice conducts sorrow differently") directly enabling Lira's method. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through her professional perception, with the environment evolving causally into the final image of a "cathedral at dawn."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift from individual hum to environmental transformation, driven by Lira's agency. The stake—preventing collective drowning in "salt memory"—is signaled early and made visceral. The cost is the key's irreversible alteration, a price paid for release that narrows future options and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: protection as release, not imprisonment. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the transformed key and the artifact's "contented sigh." Subtext operates in gesture (the keeper vanishing) and implication, resisting moralizing. The core concept of sonic absolution is fully integrated through specific, earned action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lira's technical-emotional perception. Diction is consistently precise and voice-motivated ("sonic absolution," "vibrational matching"). The prose has a distinct rhythmic control, especially in peak beats ("the ice itself became a throat"). Any elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor risk of overwriting in peak beats ("shattered glass," "audible colors") but figurative language remains coherent and serves the accumulative design. No loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion is strong. A single hairline slip in register consistency prevents a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse engineering, crypt keeping, and sonic ritual feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The story commits fully to its premise, achieving a singular artistic stance.</comment>
