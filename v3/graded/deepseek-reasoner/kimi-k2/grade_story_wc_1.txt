<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in actions like reading frost patterns. The final renunciation to remember rather than avenge is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in tears. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously—grief and resolve—without diagnostic labeling. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern density (frost, ledger, glass) escalating to a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with cost in the tears blurring the projected truth. Orientation is slightly delayed but functional, waived as disorientation serves the closure effect. The frost pattern as map is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choice—the canyon narrows, frost guides direction, kiln’s residual heat fuses glass. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV (e.g., river sound like distant applause). The kiln’s wreckage functions as micro-setting, charging the final image with cost and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens—reading frost, tracing footprints—narrowing options to the kiln discovery. Cost is legible in the fused glass projection revealing betrayal. One meaningful tightening suffices: the frost pattern leads to the trail, foreclosing other paths. No coincidence resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action—pause versus strike, memory versus vengeance—without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: purpose is to remember, letting pauses speak. Subtext operates in gestures (pressing palm to glass) and implications (scorched testament made whole).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with perceptual signature (e.g., "fragile, bright, unfinished" silhouette). Purposeful compression (e.g., "Sleep was a shallow pool") is taught and legible. Minor register drift in "steadily adaptive" slightly jars but does not obscure closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density (e.g., "frost feathers that feathered north"). Minor figurative stacking in peak beats ("trapped starlight," "drifting resonance") slightly mutes clarity but does not harm closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level propulsion supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of glass artistry, frost divination, and cartel conflict feels organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise is transformed through specific lived detail (kiln as waypoint) and non-obvious moral calculus (renunciation over vengeance).</comment>
