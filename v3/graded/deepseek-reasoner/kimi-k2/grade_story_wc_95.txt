<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lysandra's mechanical arm and coded needles create vivid interiority; her micro-choices under pressure (aligning needles, stepping on stones) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation ("depart together") feels earned by prior causality, though the envoy's "diplomatically fierce" trait remains slightly tell-y in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of the sundial and brook's reflection reweights questions as destinations with conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate; pattern of needles and angles teaches early and pays off decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass atrium, brook, and sundial actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are purposefully selective (e.g., "brass knuckles clicking like distant typewriter keys"), and spatial choreography during the duel is coherent and impactful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens; each needle shift and stone step tightens options. Cost is legible in the final reconfiguration ("depart together"), and the dominant stake (turning questions into destinations) is tested throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars (needles, sundial, brook) rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("destinations are merely questions that have grown tired of asking") that reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature ("sunlight fractured through the vaulted ceiling"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though the envoy's speech occasionally verges on overly articulate under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is densely poetic with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor figurative overload in peak beats ("fractured light above" slightly mixed with "shards") prevents a higher score, but no loops or scaffolding artifacts. Closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of dueling, philosophy, and coded objects. The core premise feels fresh and inevitable, with risk-taking (e.g., duel-as-conversation) that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes or template plots.</comment>
