<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s characterization is masterful, with consistent contradictory impulses (disguising wisdom as foolishness) and embodied emotion (laughing at blood like rubies). Her final choice to re-stitch the chart is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost through deliberate finger-pricks and the blood beacon.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira listens to the future beginning, with cost legible in the blood drops and satisfied candle. The candle’s east-lean provides crisp causal linkage to the uprising timing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice (listening stone forces disguise) and charging the final image (dome opening like an eye). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira’s expertise (bruised blue sky, dry wings of leaves).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency under the Accumulative lens; the tightening timeframe (third moonset) forces her to unravel and re-stitch, with cost unmistakable in the blood sacrifice and the satisfaction of the eternal candle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action (wisdom disguised as foolishness, silence holding stories). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the new constellation of a candle in an open hand, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends astronomical precision with lyrical abstraction (“silver thread trembling like starlight”). Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., the intruder’s retreat) are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (“echoed silence,” “blood like rubies”), and rhythm accelerates with pressure without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Concept is brilliantly original, synthesizing embroidery, astronomy, and political conspiracy into a singular vision. The execution is bold and fully committed, with the candle and blood mechanics feeling inevitable and irreplaceable.</comment>
