<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, embodied backstory (the village fire). Her internal conflict between recklessness and a desire to mend is shown through concrete micro-choices, most notably pressing her palm to the bark. The final endurance/renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as the tree drinks her tomorrows.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lira's stance crystallizes ("I barter not to escape but to repair"). The cost is legible on the page in the line "With each heartbeat, the tree drank another tomorrow she would never live." Orientation is immediate and the pattern of grafting and inlaying meaning is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful (e.g., "air smelled of bruised apples and wet limestone"). The setting is a crucible that pressures Lira's actions and the recurring image of roots cradling bones reconfigures meaning at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through a cadence shift as Lira's personal stake ("the child she had pulled from flames") is revealed, reweighting the dominant stake of mending her soul. Escalation is driven by her agency in pressing her palm to the tree, a choice that narrows her options with a visible, felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central image of grafting futures to mend past sorrows. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the inverted tower bud, representing "salvation instead of ruin" without moralizing. The concept of bartering destinies is fully integrated into the specific events and character's struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, dusky perceptual signature. The prose is highly controlled and rhythmic, though the density of figurative language in some high-pressure beats slightly risks register drift. Dialogue, though brief, is natural and carries significant subtext, advancing the plot and character dynamics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor figurative muddle occurs in "roots cradling the bone as fiercely gentle as a mother who knows the child will never wake," where the vehicle's logic slightly strains. This is a hairline slip that does not touch closure, but prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a catacomb orchard and destiny-bartering is a fresh, non-obvious angle that feels inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its premise, with risk-taking in its dense, poetic style that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The specific lived detail (e.g., the burned tarot card) avoids being a generic template.</comment>
