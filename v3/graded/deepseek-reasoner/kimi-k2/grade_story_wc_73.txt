<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("grim optimist"). Micro-choices under pressure (marking steps, rolling dice) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance is earned, though a brief lapse into telling ("no longer grim, still optimistic") slightly diminishes the embodied cost of the change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost felt in the final line's reweighting of regret. The crack in the marble and its subsequent closure provide a meaningful, on-page tightening that reconfigures the protagonist's stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and constrains tactics. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("air tasted of chalk and iron"). The recurring object (dice) charges the final image, constraining the protagonist's pivotal choice to reach through the light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by a density increase (the mathematical proofs) and a decisive pattern break (the crack in the marble). Protagonist agency is clear in marking the steps and attempting the proof, forcing a trade-off with a visible cost as the opening closes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (regret as a solvable equation) emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material: "the limit of regret as time approaches infinity is the texture of the moment just before the dice settle."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistently apt for the mathematical, melancholic POV. Purposeful elision (the nature of the staircase) is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional line-level craft. High information density with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("the dust of erased proofs"). Syntax and rhythm accelerate and breathe in step with the scene's needs, particularly in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of mathematical abstraction and emotional yearning. The core premise is fully committed to and its implications are followed without retreat. The combination feels organic and inevitable, not a checklist of elements.</comment>
