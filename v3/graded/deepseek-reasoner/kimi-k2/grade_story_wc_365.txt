<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling higher-stakes choices. Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure are character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation (embedding the shard) is earned by prior causality with visible cost, foreclosing a path. Interior contradiction is shown through her simultaneous desire to know and fear of the truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through sensory density and pattern breaks. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost: Lira's choice to seal the memory reweights the premise. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. The persistent constraint of the shard's cyclical nature shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Lira's professional bias. The green glass shard, as a recurring object, decisively constrains choices and reweights the closure. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the environment evolving causally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, through density increases and pattern breaks. The dominant stake (discovering the withheld truth) is signaled early and tightens through the console revelation. Cost is legible on the page in Lira's final act of sealing the memory, which forecloses further cyclical journeys. Pressure coheres and deepens until the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of truth and memory through the image of the embedded shard. Theme emerges organically from events and images, avoiding direct statement. Subtext operates in implication, such as the pilot's choice of silence to protect others. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature reflected in sensory-focused narration. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Diction remains within Lira's plausible lexicon, even under pressure. Rhythm controls heighten pressure without obscuring clarity, though some sentences are complex.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off. Minor issues: some complex syntax in peak beats slightly affects clarity, but no loops or scaffold artifacts. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally, supporting the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of parallel universes and sensory mapping feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, fully committing to the premise. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Emotional truth and human complexity avoid generic templates.</comment>
