<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor's spiritual curiosity is embodied through concrete actions like tracing stars with phosphor, and his final choice to "open the vault of his chest" is earned by prior causality. The character's internal contradiction—strength found in admitting weakness—is dramatized in scene, not summarized. A minor deduction for the cosmic scale slightly distancing emotional immediacy, but the final choice carries a visible, felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the cost legible in the final image of the station "alive behind him." The pattern of stillness and light intensifies to a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. The lens is taught early and held throughout, with the yellow lantern glass serving as a persistent constraint that shapes the final, decisive image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station is not merely described but actively constrains choice and charges the final image, with its "dormant engines sighing" and "cracked floorboards" becoming the soil for seeds of light. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the janitor's unique perception, making the setting a crucible for the transformation. The environment is inextricable from the narrative's logic and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, moving from observation to empathetic tracing to the final, vulnerable act of "open[ing] the vault of his chest." This single, meaningful deepening reweights the stake of cosmic loneliness with a cost felt in his "pulse flicker[ing] like a broken beacon." The pressure coheres and tightens through density increase, not causal turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The theme of vulnerability as strength emerges organically from the janitor's actions and the station's transformation, culminating in the resonant, non-literal final image of a "constellation shaped like an open hand." The concept is fully integrated, resisting moralizing and offering a profound answer through scene work. The yellow lantern glass's healing into a "seam of gold" is a masterful thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that filters the cosmos through a janitor's lyrical yet grounded sensibility. The prose's rhythmic control under pressure is exceptional, with purposeful compression and elision that serve the accumulative design. The voice is singular and consistent, with no head-hopping or register drift to disrupt the closure effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion that accelerates and breathes with the scene's needs. A minor deduction for a potential risk of overwriting in the dense figurative language, though it remains coherent and voice-motivated. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in the peak closure beats, preserving clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The core premise of a cosmic janitor is a brilliantly original synthesis, executed with astonishing specificity and authenticity of vision. The story commits fully to its poetic logic, and the final reconfiguration feels both surprising and inevitable. The risk-taking in style and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
