<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is deeply embodied through tactile interactions with crater glass and specific micro-choices like pressing shards to her cheek. Her final realization—that missing pieces are crystallized moments—feels earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the ringing ribs and quiet hope. Contradictory impulses (laughing and crying at cheerful gloom) operate simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, with pattern breaks (seed→vine→mirror) deepening stakes. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lira carries essence rather than searches, with cost legible in "ribs rang like bells" and "quiet, steady hope." Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The geode cave constrains choices (seed placement) and charges the final image through the migrating bird's glass-edged feathers. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (crunching boots, tingling fingertips), woven into action. The setting evolves from constraint to revelation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under accumulative lens: each seed planting deepens understanding and narrows options. Cost is unmistakable in the weight of "missing pieces settle on her tongue like salt" and the transformative mirror revelation. Stakes shift from physical paths to emotional essence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mirror revelation—missing pieces as crystallized moments—offering a non-literal answer to why paths disappear. Subtext operates through images (bird tasting emotions, cave rolling over). No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars like the child-self memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control ("cheerful gloom," "ribs rang like bells"). Purposeful compression (e.g., "three seeds, each glowing faintly") taught early and paid off. POV stable and voice consistent, with elision serving closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High information density with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent (e.g., "cheerful gloom" recurs with deepened meaning). Syntax varies purposefully, accelerating in peak beats. No artifacts obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of recollectionist, crater glass, and migrating bird feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise transformed through specific lived detail (sailor's gratitude, child-Lira memory). No template echoes.</comment>
