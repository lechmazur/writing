<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer’s motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Her final choice to release the words is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the traded signature and lifted veil. The confidence man’s late appearance is a minor weakness, slightly reducing immediacy of relational pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens (causal/accumulative) holds strong. Closure is a decisive change (releasing words) with conceptual repricing (library as hothouse), landing with cost (signature trade, library fading). Causality is tight, with the watch and letters driving turns. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, actively constraining choices and charging the final image. The library’s mist, shelves, and glyphs are tactile and purposefully woven into action. Sensory detail is selective and vivid, reflecting POV urgency. The watch and letters function as micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens, with clear cost (signature trade). The watch’s reversed ticking and propagation delays create coherent pressure that tightens options. The dominant stake (finding/releasing words) is tested and transformed through on-page choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of unspoken words as seeds. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication (veil, watch, letters). Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature and rhythmic control. Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., propagation delays) are taught and paid off. Diction remains within the POV’s lexicon, even under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and polished, with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though slightly dense in peak beats ("electric anticipation," "evaporating breath"). Minor scaffold in adjacent sentences ("She walked deeper... The shelves responded") but no loops or artifacts harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of concepts (cipher as living sentence, library as hothouse) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking with cyclical time and propagation delays heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
