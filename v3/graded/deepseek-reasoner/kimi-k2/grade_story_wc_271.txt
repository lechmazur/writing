<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her "quiet talent" for noticing joy tilting to grief is dramatized through somatic markers, and her final choice to plant the photograph feels earned by prior causality with visible cost. No diagnostic label-speak or emotional summary; interiority remains grounded in sensory experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in the final image of the photograph guarding the "pearl of stillness." The lens holds throughout, with pattern breaks (somatic markers yielding to calm) reweighting the stake. Orientation is clear by ~120 words; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated and constrains choice: the arboretum's olive tree and cliff edge pressure Mira's actions, and the photograph's physical handling charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "scent of salt and rosemary," "warm stone"), with no generic placeholder description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, deepening through somatic intensity and her choice to engage with the tree. Cost is unmistakable in the "visible yet no longer churning" grief and the physical act of planting the photograph. One meaningful tightening (the somatic markers yielding to calm) suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (photograph, tree, somatic markers) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to anchoring optimism in realism, reweighting prior material through the image of silt in clear water. No thematic echo or summary in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("joy began to tilt toward grief") and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression (e.g., "drone strike wedding survivor" as species name) is taught early and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and legible ("like a second pulse," "like skin over a healing wound"). Syntax varies purposefully, and momentum is maintained through concrete action and image. No artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes familiar elements (grief, memory) through specific, grounded choices like the somatic markers and the "pearl of stillness" concept. The drone strike wedding survivor angle feels fresh and non-obvious, transformed through lived detail. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
