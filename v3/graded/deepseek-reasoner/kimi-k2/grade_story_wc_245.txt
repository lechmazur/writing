<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The blind mapmaker’s interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. Her transformation from mapping external geographies to internal emotional depths is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the final realization. The platinum ring’s evolution from tool to internal compass demonstrates a credible, character-specific change. Minor deduction for the ease of her linguistic absorption, which borders on convenience but does not break motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pattern and density increasing toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on the page with undeniable cost in the final image of her becoming a "living chart." Orientation is immediate and functional; the stillpoint's discovery is taught early and pays off. The final beat reconfigures her purpose with felt, conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the POV's unique perception. The environment actively guides her journey and evolves with the narrative pressure. The quartz trunks and starlight pool are integrated into action, not static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as a decisive intensification of pattern and density that reweights the dominant stake. The trail of musical notes tightens options, leading to the stillpoint discovery. Protagonist agency drives the escalation through her dowsing action and choice to step inside. Cost is legible in the final realization that she has been mapping herself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of mapping and self-discovery, resisting direct statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of navigating emotional depths. Subtext operates powerfully in the reconfiguration of the compass ring and the forest's song. The grief chord is earned through specific, dramatized experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a compelling perceptual signature shaped by her blindness and synesthetic perception. Diction and syntax are controlled and purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that remains legible under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though the "salt and cedar" metaphor risks slight abstraction. One minor paraphrase loop ("mapmaker no longer, but a living chart") slightly dulls the final image. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise synthesizes cartography, synesthesia, and emotional discovery in a fresh, non-obvious way. The ultrasonic forest and linguistic absorption are highly specific and irreplaceable. The concept is fully committed to and follows its implications without retreat. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
