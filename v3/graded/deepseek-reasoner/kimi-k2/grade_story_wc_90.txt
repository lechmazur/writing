<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lin's steadfast pacifism is embodied through micro-choices (stitching, following the tapestry) that culminate in her offering the Tear. A single line of telliness ("pacifism was not surrender but relentless presence") slightly abstracts a key motive, but her actions consistently reveal character under pressure. The final choice to offer the Tear is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure builds through density of imagery and emotional weight, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the garden is revealed and gravity returns. Cost is legible in the dissolution of the Tear and the release of grief. The linkage from pulse to stitch to corridor is coherent and taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The recycled ship is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices (the creaking hull, the wild basil, the sealed airlock). Kwan Yin's Tear and the photographs are recurring objects that constrain action and decisively charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Lin's POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lin's agency under the accumulative lens: her decision to stitch the photographs and then follow the tapestry deepens the stakes and narrows her options, leading to the irreversible offering of the Tear. The cost of this relinquishment is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of grief and reconciliation emerges organically through the specific actions of stitching and offering. The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the garden growing on old weapons, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied in Lin's perception. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The AI's dialogue is brief but carries distinct idiom and subtext. Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language ("creaked like an old violin," "a lighthouse remembering the sea") is consistent, purposeful, and heightens pressure. There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a pacifist in a spaceship using embroidery and a religious relic to perform shadow work is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through with emotional specificity and authenticity of vision. Risk-taking heightens stakes.</comment>
