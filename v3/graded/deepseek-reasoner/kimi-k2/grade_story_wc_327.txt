<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in the premise, compelling high-stakes action. Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the translation of texture into sound. However, the internal conflict between her role as the last speaker and the act of letting the language die feels summarized rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held throughout, with pressure escalating through a decisive cadence shift at the climax. Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing: language dies, yet its texture is saved, reconfiguring the meaning of the curse and her purpose. The cost is legible on the page in the cooling of her copper veins and the crumbled bone towers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is not merely vivid but is the central crucible of the conflict. The bone towers, tunnel of echoes, and the diamond itself are indispensable elements that actively constrain choices, supply resources, and charge the final image. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and purposeful, fully integrated into the protagonist's goal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from observation to active translation. The dominant stake—preserving a language's essence—is clear, and the cost of its transformation is unmistakably felt in the story's final beats. A single, profound deepening at the climax is perfectly sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of preservation through transformation emerges organically from the specific, high-concept events. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the curse as instruction and the death of language as a metamorphosis. It embraces complexity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a consistent, lyrical texture. The prose's rhythmic control under pressure is exceptional. A minor deduction for occasional dense, almost overwrought phrasing ("quietly articulate still") that very slightly obscures immediacy in a high-pressure beat, though the pattern is largely taught and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is excellent. A minor instance of potential register drift exists ("quietly articulate"), but it is consistent with the voice. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles that harm the closure's clarity or impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise is strikingly original and executed with bold conceptual integrity. The synthesis of language, geology, and ornithology feels inevitable in hindsight, and the story fully commits to its unique logic. The risk-taking in style and concept heightens stakes and meaning without ever becoming a gimmick.</comment>
