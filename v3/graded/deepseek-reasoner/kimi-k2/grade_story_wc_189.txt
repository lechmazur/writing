<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian and Mara are rendered with profound interiority and embodied contradiction. His chronicler's precision wars with his emotional avoidance; her pursuit is both accusation and plea. Their final shared silence and the cicada's warmth reveal hierarchy of values through micro-choices with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the siblings' shared silence under the stars reconfigures their relationship. The cicada's foresight provides the decisive cadence shift, and cost is legible in Mara's tears salting the stone and Elian's final chronicle entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The grotto and jade cicada are indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are filtered through Elian's professional habit yet transcend into texture. The setting evolves from a place of solitary pursuit to one of shared reconciliation, its spatial choreography flawless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: Elian's touch activates the cicada, Mara's arrival forces confrontation, their shared holding of the stone deepens the stake. The cost is unmistakable in the blurred ink of the unmailed letter and the sister's tears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the cicada's operation and the siblings' silence. The final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. The concept of transition periods is fully integrated into the narrative's texture and emotional calculus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, observant texture that modulates under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but carries profound subtext and goal-pursuit. The prose possesses a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, with any elision taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is precise and pattern-taught ("time was not a line but a tidepool"). Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. Read-aloud rhythm is flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal-pool chronicling, a jade cicada, and familial reconciliation feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in the accumulative, quiet structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The perspective is memorable and authentically singular, avoiding template plots.</comment>
