<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara’s characterization is deeply textured, with her revolutionary past and poetic present creating rich internal contradiction. Her micro-choices, like covering mirrors and translating the shard, reveal a clear hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation—giving away the vase—is earned by prior causality with visible cost, embodying Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant). Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the asteroid as a "seed ship" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is tight, with the shard's discovery driving all subsequent beats. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is a masterclass in micro-setting, constraining choice (mirrors showing time) and charging the final image (constellations of stories). Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through Mara's poetic perception. The setting is inextricable from the plot and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens. The stake (ownership vs. stewardship) is signaled early and tightens through Mara's choices, culminating in a final, costly act of renunciation. The pressure coheres and deepens, reweighting the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict over the shard, resisting tidy morals for a complex, resonant answer about stewardship and memory. The final poem offers a non-literal, profound summation that reweights all prior material without moralizing. Subtext is rich in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose is consistently poetic yet precise, mirroring Mara's mindset. Dialogue (though brief) is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext and advancing the plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic variety. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the phrase "burnished with sorrow," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon in a peak beat. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of sci-fi setting, archaeological conflict, and poetic elegy is fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and transformed through grounded, character-driven choices. Risk-taking in the lyric-prose hybrid heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
