<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("palms against stone still warm") and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to "carry the spark" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost as the crown's weight shifts "from burden to blessing." Contradictory impulses of disenchantment and hope act simultaneously in the climactic scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through pattern and cadence shifts. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost: "the weight of the crown shift from burden to blessing." Orientation is immediate; the taught pattern of menace and memory pays off at closure, transforming the "lace of menace" into "lace of memory."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is purposefully woven into action and constrains choice: the "basalt stair," "seam of quartz," and "ember grotto" pressure the climb and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("heat scented of iron and pine resin"), filtered through the queen's POV. The grotto itself is the crucible for the decisive change.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful cadence shift at the confrontation. The dominant stake (reconciliation vs. conquest) tightens through the climb, forcing a stance crystallization. Cost is legible on the page: the queen feels the flame settle "where ambition had once been," a visible forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of reconciliation through the final image of the "living lantern." Theme emerges organically from events and images ("lace of menace became lace of memory"), resisting tidy morals. The core concept of "bleeding starlight" integrates fully with the thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with a consistent, voice-motivated POV. Purposeful compression and elision ("Together, without words") are taught and paid off. Diction remains within the queen's plausible lexicon, even at peak stress. The internal voice maintains coherence and specificity throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("lace of menace"). Minor deduction for one potentially dense metaphor ("walking through the lace of her own unease") that slightly slows momentum, but clarity at closure is unharmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of psychological fantasy feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the confrontational structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through grounded, character-specific choices, avoiding template plots. The final reconfiguration is both fresh and earned.</comment>
