<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is deeply specific and embodied, particularly in his "inadvertently stubborn" persistence with the dead. His final choice to include his own name is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost through bleeding fingers. The emotional progression feels authentic, avoiding diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under a Hybrid lens, with the lighthouse's restoration reconfiguring the town's relationship to loss. Cost is legible on the page in the line "He wrote until his fingers bled ink and salt." Causality is tight, with the lens's glow and the library's collapse providing coherent, motivated linkages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The underwater library is not just described but navigated, and the lens is a micro-setting object whose evolving use is central to the plot. Sensory details are filtered through Elias's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens, moving from curiosity to a costly, decisive act. The dominant stake (giving rest to the unburied) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully as Elias writes, with the cost of his physical exertion and ultimate self-inclusion made unmistakably clear on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of answering silent distress signals, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the guiding lighthouse light. The central thematic question of memory versus forgetting is explored with complexity through the library's "occupying impossible spaces."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, somber rhythm that modulates effectively under pressure. The prose possesses a strong perceptual signature, viewing the world through the lens of an undertaker ("cracked halo," "ledger of the dead"). POV is stable and deeply anchored in Elias's consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for occasional dense metaphorical phrasing (e.g., "the occupying impossible spaces between memory and forgetting") which, while beautiful, requires a slight re-read. Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and clear, with no loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of an undertaker, a broken lighthouse lens, and a sunken library is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of silent distress signals is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. The story commits fully to its premise, resulting in a singular and memorable vision.</comment>
