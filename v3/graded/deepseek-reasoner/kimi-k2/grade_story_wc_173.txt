<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lys's characterization is precise and embodied; her chastity as a "blade" and her "reverence" for the threads are concrete, character-particular motives. Her final choice to absorb the prism is earned by prior causality—her training in withholding and her specific skill with the "language of absence." The felt cost is visible as the prism sinks into her skin "like a seed into soil," a quiet but definitive endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lys internalizes the echoes, reconfiguring the empire's silence into memory. The cost is legible in the prism's weight "pulsing with the weight of every voice" and the sanctuary's dissolution. Orientation is immediate and purposeful, anchoring who, where, and why within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is not merely described but actively constrains choice and charges the final image; its fracturing walls and dissolving structure are integral to the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("snow fell in slow, deliberate flakes," "marble began to sing"). The setting evolves causally with the action, from starlit silence to a "cathedral of light" and finally quiet ruin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift and density increase as the unraveling threads release a "chorus of defiance." The dominant stake (freeing erased souls) is signaled early and tightens through Lys's ceremonial actions. The cost is the sanctuary's destruction and the permanent, physical burden of the prism now "warm against her ribs," a felt price that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict: silence weaponized becomes defiance, memory as rebellion. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—not victory, but dissemination of memory through dreams and sudden recollections. Subtext operates powerfully in the "lullaby of conformity" being broken not by a shout, but by a whisper that unravels light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply internal, with a distinct perceptual signature that filters the world through a lyrical, precise lens ("bodily poetic inscriptions"). The prose's rhythmic control is exceptional, modulating from deliberate, ceremonial cadences to the searing, furious release of light. There is no dialogue, but the internal voice is coherent and compelling throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistent, voice-motivated, and pays off ("silence, when held too long, becomes a scream"). Sentence-level rhythm expertly supports the accumulating tension and the final, quiet resolution. A minor deduction for occasional elevated diction slightly outside the POV's immediate lexicon (e.g., "bodily poetic inscriptions").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core concept—harvesting echoes through chastity as a weapon—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of ideas. The execution is bold and fully committed, transforming the "chaste courtesan" trope through specific, grounded choices in world logic and moral calculus. The ending's quiet dissemination of memory feels inevitable and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
