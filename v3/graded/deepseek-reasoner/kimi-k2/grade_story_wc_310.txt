<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's "quiet enthusiasm" persists through the revelation that her actions are an echo, creating a credible emotional stance. Her final choice to lie down and become part of the expansion is an Earned Stasis, foreclosing her individual path with a visible, felt cost that is scaled to the cosmic premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through the increasing density and clarity of the static bursts. Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: the final image of her sent light becoming the first light reconfigures the entire premise with undeniable conceptual cost, landing perfectly on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck and the foreign coins are not just described; they actively constrain Mira's choices and charge the final image. The coins are tactile tools for tuning, and the observatory's dissolution is the direct cost of her successful alignment, making the setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift as the static clarifies into her own voice, reweighting the dominant stake. The cost is legible: the observatory dissolves, and she dissolves with it, a price paid for achieving purpose retroactively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of finding meaning in a predetermined universe emerges entirely through the core concept and specific imagery, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of sent light becoming first light, reweighting all prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply embedded in Mira's perception, with a distinct perceptual signature ("static bursts not as noise but as language spoken in reverse"). The prose's lyrical, compressed quality is pattern-taught and pays off at closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor figurative density in the final third ("distillate of purpose") slightly softens the closure image but does not obscure cause/effect or break clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "backwards prophecy" and the end of the universe feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its high-concept premise, and the specific, grounded choice of using coins as tuning filters creates a memorable and ingenious perspective.</comment>
