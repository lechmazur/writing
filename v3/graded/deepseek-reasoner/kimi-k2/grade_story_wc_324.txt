<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her "persistent curiosity" driving micro-choices under pressure. Her final vow to carry stories is earned by prior causality, with the cost visible in the heavier photograph and her readiness for the next call. The emotional progression is realistic, layering professional duty with personal renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through a cadence shift from one ghost to a gathering chorus, reweighting the dominant stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara's role crystallizes into a vow, with cost legible in the final image of the heavier photograph and her stepping into the noisy city.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as a micro-setting that pressures choices through its cracked tiles and sun-starved vines. Key objects—the tracer, hearing aid, and photograph—constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: Mara's choice to listen and speak each message deepens the stake from one lost name to a chorus of erased voices. The cost is unmistakable as her vow forecloses a quiet life, charging the final image with the weight of her new purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of giving voice to the erased emerges organically from the concrete action of recording messages. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of Mara carrying their stories, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like the old man touching the photo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that modulates under pressure ("the reeling hush... folding around them like damp velvet"). Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. The voice remains coherent and specific throughout emotional peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("The last photograph... felt heavier now, as if it held not just one child but all of them"). No loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and legible, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes the supernatural and emotional in a fresh, specific way, grounded in Mara's unique tools and world. The core concept of "incidental heroism" is transformed through lived detail and a non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
