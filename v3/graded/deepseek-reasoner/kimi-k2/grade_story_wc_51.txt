<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fractal weaver's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her high-stakes choice to calcify. Her interiority is character-particular and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Minor deduction for some interiority that borders on abstract ("boundary-lessly trapped") rather than fully concrete.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with undeniable cost on the page ("ribs turning first to coral, then to stone"). Orientation is immediate and taught; the pattern of burden-release escalates coherently to a decisive cadence shift. A persistent constraint (the grotto's weight-acceptance) shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The bronze grotto and kerosene lamp are micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully woven through action. The environment evolves causally with events and subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is coherent and tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a clear density increase and cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake (relief from burdens). The cost is legible on the page through the calcification process. Protagonist agency drives the escalation via her deliberate orientation and use of the lamp. The final trade-off (freedom for a stone-tether) has visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (burdens, frost, calcification) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of weight and release. Subtext operates powerfully in implication and image ("some weights are meant to be carried by stone"). Avoids moralizing and embraces complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The voice is consistently poetic yet grounded in the character's perception. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off without muddle. Minor deduction for a slight register elevation in phrases like "boundary-lessly trapped," which feels slightly abstract for the POV's lexicon, though it is consistent with the voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of burden, transformation, and release. The combination of elements (fractal weaver, bronze grotto, calcification) feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. High specificity and authenticity of vision.</comment>
