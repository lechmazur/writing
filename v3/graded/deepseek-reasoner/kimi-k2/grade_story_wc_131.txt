<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and fierce, rooted in a desire for visibility that compels her to risk discovery. Her micro-choices, like pressing the tape to her ear and later giving it to the girl, reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Embodied emotion is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final choice to part with the fragment is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lira understands visibility travels both ways; cost is legible in her shared tears. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory density and the tape's discovery. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words, establishing who, where, and when. A persistent constraint (the flickering lights) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The crawl space and library function as a micro-setting that critically constrains Lira's choices and movement. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through her expertise and urgency. The recurring object (the tape fragment) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent and tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens: her discovery of the tape deepens the stake, and her choice to give it away is a meaningful tightening that forecloses an option. The cost is unmistakable in her shared tears and the relinquishment of a cherished fragment. Pressure coheres through the flickering lights and the goal-directed hunt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of visibility and connection emerges organically from events and images, culminating in the non-literal, resonant realization that "visibility travels in both directions." Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence, like the girl's soundless crying. The ending offers a profound answer to the central question without moralizing, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Lira's expert, sensory-rich observations. The prose has a distinct texture and rhythmic control, even under pressure. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Free indirect style is clean and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language ("sapphire hush," "lighter than a moth wing") is consistent, purposeful, and enhances clarity. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and effective. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of a hidden world, ghost currents, and memory, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth and human complexity are paramount, avoiding generic templates. Bold risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The story commits fully to its singular artistic stance.</comment>
