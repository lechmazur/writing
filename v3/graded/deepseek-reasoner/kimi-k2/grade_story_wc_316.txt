<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Both Kaels exhibit concrete, contradictory interiority under pressure, with embodied emotion ("felt the familiar hollow where his panic used to live"). Their final choice of mutual surrender is earned by the scene's causality, with visible cost in the spilling of micro-memories and the subsequent emotional thaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly, building pressure through sensory and emotional density. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as mutual surrender slices through pretense, with cost legible in the spilled cerebrospinal fluid and the raw, unfamiliar laugh. The scroll's final rule provides a decisive conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The floating dojo and rewriting Pacific are vividly specific and purposefully pressure the characters' choices, constraining the conflict to this insulated space. The jar and tatami mats are tactile, lived-in objects that charge the final image of overflowing rain, perfectly mirroring the internal state of re-sensitization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, moving from stated opposition to the decisive, costly action of breaking the jar. The dominant stake (defeating numbness) tightens meaningfully through this act, forcing the clone's surrender and the brain's vivification, with the cost of lost memories made visceral on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core conflict and the final, resonant image of the rain-filled jar, offering a non-literal answer to the central question of emotional numbness. The concept of "becoming the storm that remembers it is water" is profound and fully earned by the particulars of the narrative, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control that modulates perfectly with emotional intensity. The voice is consistently poetic yet grounded in the character's consciousness, with purposeful elision (the nature of the "dissociative sacrament") that serves the mystery and pays off emotionally.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and compelling rhythm. A minor register drift occurs in the peak beat with the line "To vivify is to choose which spark gets oxygen," which feels slightly elevated for the moment, preventing a higher score. Otherwise, the line-level craft is masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A highly original, non-obvious synthesis of sci-fi and literary introspection. The core concept of a clone custody battle over a duplicate brain is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, feeling both fresh and inevitable. The risk-taking in concept and style heightens stakes and coherence.</comment>
