<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Priest's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; embodied emotion in micro-choices like smiling "soft as snowfall" reveals character. Final renunciation feels earned through prior causality, though interior contradiction could be slightly more dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong; closure lands with cost as demon dissolves into reinforcing letters. Orientation is immediate, and the lattice's Morse code vibration provides coherent pressure that crystallizes the final stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dimensional anchor constrains choices and charges the final image; sensory details like "silence that decorates" are purposeful and woven through action. The palette and pedal function as micro-settings that shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by priest's agency through layered silences and rhetorical reversals; cost is legible when demon touches the bow and unravels. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars like the loop pedal's reversals; final image offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Assumptions becoming visible threads provides conceptual repricing with cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled rhythmic prose; purposeful compression in phrases like "decorates with silence" is taught and paid off. POV remains stable and voice-consistent throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; figurative language like "time pooled into itself" serves pattern and payoff. Minor density in peak beats prevents perfect score, but clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of theological and technological concepts feels inevitable; risk-taking in structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity in rhetorical devices transforms familiar tropes.</comment>
