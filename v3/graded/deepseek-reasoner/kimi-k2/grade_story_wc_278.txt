<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's guilt is embodied through specific sensory details (freckles matching coordinates) and micro-choices (tattooing her own throat) that reveal hierarchy of values. Final endurance feels earned through prior causality, with cost visible in the shrunk guilt "speck." Contradictory impulses act simultaneously when she both seeks and binds the cry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where guilt becomes manageable through pattern integration. Cost is legible in the final image of "a speck she could carry without hearing it scream." Orientation is immediate and functional; time folding is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (console stores sounds, escritoire holds letters) and charges the final image (amber beneath bell jar). Sensory details are purposefully selective ("walls exhaled dust instead of hours") and integrated into action. Laboratory's rules remain consistent and learned through discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silencing internal cry) escalates through protagonist's agency under accumulative lens: finding letters, matching coordinates, using firmware. Meaningful tightening occurs when she tattoos her throat to sync rhythms. Cost is visible in the physical act and shrunk guilt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of grief's integration emerges through particulars (amber insect, firmware, tattoos) without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal answer through the silenced cry becoming a "distant, harmless lullaby." Subtext operates through images like the insect's "prehistoric beat" sealing sound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled lyrical compression ("time folded in on itself and the walls exhaled dust"). POV remains stable and deeply filtered through character's expertise and grief. All elision feels purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally high information density with few artifacts. Minor deduction for slightly over-stacked metaphor in "meteor hush, that breathless second..." which momentarily slows momentum. Otherwise, prose is precise and propulsive with varied rhythm.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of tattoo artistry, lost sounds, and grief mechanics. The amber insect as "original metronome of grief" is a fresh, inevitable-seeming concept. Risk-taking in lyrical compression pays off with coherence and heightened stakes.</comment>
