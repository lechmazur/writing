<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her through the threshold. Her prism-minded sight and final choice to plant the seed are embodied and character-particular. However, her internal conflict in the peak choice moment is summarized rather than shown acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost as she carries the seeds "rooted in her pulse." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building density through image and pattern. The final image reconfigures her purpose with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The grotto is intensely specific and pressures choices, most notably when "gravity now pulled sideways" and she walks on walls. The mercury pool and luminous runes are integral, not ornamental, and the setting charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens, with the tightening choice to plant the seed. The cost is legible as the threshold "convulsed, trying to eject her." However, the pressure from the inverted gravity timeframe is not fully exploited to raise tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully from the crystallized intentions and moments of almost-was, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the child about to tell a lie, reweighting the story's purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature ("prism-minded sight," "clandestinely luminous"). The patterned elision and lyrical compression are taught early and paid off at closure without obscuring meaning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly inventive, but density approaches overwriting in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "crystallized intentions, each facet reflecting..."). A minor figurative muddle slightly dulls momentum, though closure remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A stunningly original synthesis of concept and image. The premise of inverted gravity and seeds of vigilance is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the character's perception and the world's logic. The risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
