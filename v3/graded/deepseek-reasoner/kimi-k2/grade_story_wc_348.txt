<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is deeply rooted in grief and atonement, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., mixing catalysts with "old precision"). The final renunciation is earned, though the backstory integration brushes the 20% limit, slightly summarizing the lab fire incident.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pattern density (water, foam, chrysalis) escalating to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure. The cost is legible in the final image of the chrysalis fused to stone, translating loss into connection. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the braided ravine and quartz vein constraining choice and charging the closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "foam scribbled white glyphs"), filtered through the POV's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the insight from river foam patterns forcing a stance crystallization. Cost is visible in the resin setting, binding "loss to the possibility of form." One meaningful tightening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (chrysalis, polymer chains) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to separation and connection, reweighting prior material through the final image of the "amber lens."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("symphonically minded" refractions). Diction remains within the chemist's lexicon, and elision (e.g., the lab fire) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, though "symphonically minded" repeats and risks slight ornamentation. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and supports closure. Minor register elevation in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of grief and polymer science feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting.</comment>
