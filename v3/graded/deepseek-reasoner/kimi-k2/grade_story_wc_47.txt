<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, painful backstory. Her internal conflict is embodied through tactile actions (kneeling, grafting) rather than summarized. The final choice to graft the rose and seek growth over erasure feels earned by her proactive stance and the environment's response. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on reflective summary in the brother's quoted confession, which briefly abstracts the present moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, building pressure through sensory density and pattern repetition (dripping, moss pulse). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the garden's graft offers a new, quiet meaning. Cost is legible in the final image of carrying the garden's quiet within her. The hologram's appearance via a water drop on the pendant is a minor coincidence but serves the accumulative pattern and does not resolve the conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned data center turned moss garden is indispensable, constraining Lira's choice (seeking a specific server rack) and charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and filtered through her goal-directed perception (e.g., feeling the "faint hum of residual current"). The environment evolves causally with the action, becoming an active participant in the graft.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift and density increase (the hologram projection, the moss's pulse) that reweights the stake of forgiveness. Lira's agency—proffering the rose—drives the final deepening. The cost is the vulnerability of accepting the garden's answer and the quiet endurance required to wait for the bloom, which is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of transforming grief into growth emerges organically through concrete action and image (grafting, the fossilized bee, the dripping pattern). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of forgiveness through the natural world's quiet logic. Avoids moralizing; the rose petal as "proof that even data can become mercy" is earned through the particulars of the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lira's perceptual signature, with a distinct, lyrical rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity ("protected vulnerability trembling in her chest like a bird against ribs"). The voice is consistent and purposefully compressed, with no head-hopping. The elision of how the hologram technically works is taught by the story's mythic logic and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design ("honeyed hush," "slow green heartbeat"). Sentences vary in length and structure to create rhythm. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. The final paragraph's cadence beautifully supports the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of tech ruin and organic renewal is fresh and specific, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is fully committed to, with the grafting knife and server rack becoming unique, irreplaceable elements. Emotional truth and risk-taking heighten stakes without obscuring clarity; the story avoids template plots and generic settings.</comment>
