<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("joy sparkling out as silver beads"). The final realization—that belonging is resonance—is earned by prior causality and the feather's transformation. The "softly ingenious" trait constrains action, visible when her perception translates star patterns into memory maps. Micro-choices under pressure, like setting the feather in the socket, reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: the city's exhale lifts her, and the feather's destruction releases a final flare. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern breaks (fireflies rising, consoles awakening) reweighting the stake. The childhood memory reveal, while slightly convenient, is integrated into the closure image. Orientation is clear within 120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (the observatory socket enables the key action) and charging the finale (corridors glow like "veins of molten pearl"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("thin skin of darkness stitched with glints of bioluminescent algae"). The underwater facility pressures tactics and supplies resources (the fireflies, the console). Spatial choreography is coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: placing the feather triggers the city's response, narrowing options and changing knowledge. Cost is legible in the feather's destruction and the city's exhale. The dominant stake (learning belonging) tightens through a cadence shift (water shivering, fireflies rising). No coincidental resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and event ("belonging was not possession but resonance"). The ending offers a non-literal answer via the final image of the message in a bottle. Subtext operates in implication (the feather as key, the city mapping futures). Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature ("stirring silt into slow galaxies"). Diction remains within the character's lexicon ("shadowseam wonder"). Purposeful compression and lyrical patterning are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with pressure. Minor overwriting risk in peak beats ("constellations in miniature, and she followed their ascent...") but no mixed metaphors or clarity loss. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Read-aloud ear test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes familiar ideas (underwater cities, astrology) into a fresh, organic whole. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle, executed with specificity and emotional truth. Risk-taking (lyric mode, accumulative design) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
