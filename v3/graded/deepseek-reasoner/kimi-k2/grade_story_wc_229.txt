<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply specific, with her motivation rooted in generational knowledge and a personal need to be heard. Her final, fierce scream of tenderness is a credible, earned culmination of her internal conflict between silence and expression, with a visible cost of exhaustion. The vial cork is a potent, character-particular object that anchors her emotional history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through sensory density and emotional intensity toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands with undeniable cost—Mara is "spent," the cork dissolves—though the climax's causality (scream → purification) feels slightly more asserted than fully dramatized, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are masterfully selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's expertise and emotional state (e.g., "ozone and copper—that tasted like screaming tenderness"). The setting is fully integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (prove whispers travel farther) and escalate through a single, powerful intensification as the vibration demands more. Mara's agency drives the climax—her scream is a decisive act that reweights the stakes with a visible cost, perfectly fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme—that fierce tenderness must sometimes scream to be heard—is earned through concrete events and the final, resonant image of the pulsing lighthouse. It offers a complex, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing, emerging organically from Mara's struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice possesses a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that remains consistent and controlled under peak pressure. The prose is highly compressed yet legible, with a rhythmic cadence that supports the accumulative design. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor instance of potentially mixed metaphor ("screaming tenderness" though it works contextually) and a slight register elevation in the climax, but these do not significantly obscure clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lighthouse, vibrational magic, and emotional purification feels fresh and inevitable. The concept is committed to fully and executed with high originality, transforming its elements through specific, grounded details and a singular artistic stance. A clear +0.2 risk bonus applies.</comment>
