<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Investigator's motivation is clear and deepens from duty to cultivated foresight. Micro-choices under pressure (ribbon use, door rhythm) reveal competence and values. Mara's endurance is embodied and costs are felt, though her confession lacks the same embodied contradiction as the investigator's peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of wind/breath/pulse builds to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost (the sphere's contraction and the patch's resewing). The final image reconfigures the maze into a "completed sentence," charging the foresight theme. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is a crucible that constrains choice and charges the final image. The container, sphere, and ribbon are micro-settings that directly shape tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("salt-stained concrete," "swinging shadows"). The labyrinth's reconfiguration at the end is a powerful, earned visual payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (sound/silence, spatial integrity) are signaled early and escalate through the ribbon's behavior and the sphere's pulse. The investigator's decision to take Mara's place is a major tightening. Cost is legible in the burst bulb and the precise timing required. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of foresight emerges organically from action and image, not statement. The final image of the resewn patch offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in gesture (pressing the patch to her heart) and implication (the maze as a sentence). Resists moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and perceptually distinct ("hazy precision," professional filter). Prose rhythm is controlled and modulates with pressure. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven. Minor register drift in the climax ("slamming the doors") is a slight tonal shift from the prevailing lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("lazy lighthouse beam," "great metal lung"). No loops or scaffolding artifacts. A single mixed metaphor ("bleeding memory") is minor and doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of quantum event (singularity), port setting, and thematic exploration of foresight is fresh and specific. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotional conclusion. The "hazy precision" tone is a singular artistic stance that heightens stakes.</comment>
