<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling her to paint faster as the vision unfolds. Her "methodically hopeful" trait is embodied in action, not just label. A minor deduction for a slight lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beat; her emotional progression is largely linear wonder.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the glyphs lift into the sky, reweighting the city's reality with undeniable conceptual cost. The pattern of accumulating kindnesses is taught early and pays off. Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse and smog act as a crucible, constraining and enabling the action. The glass ceiling is the essential canvas, and the brush is a key tool that charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and perfectly integrated into the POV's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens; each stroke deepens the phenomenon and narrows her focus until the final, costly act of signing her name. The cost is legible in the brush's dissolution and her relinquishment of sleep.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from the specific events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about the power of kindness without moralizing. The final image of the glyphs as stars reweights all prior material. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Mira's distinctive perceptual signature. The voice is consistently poetic and controlled, with rhythmic prose that accelerates with the action. The non-standard elements (bird speech, purr translation) are taught and legible within the story's logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. A single minor deduction for a potential density issue in the lengthy sentence describing the janitor's tears and statement, which momentarily slows the high-tempo beat, though it remains coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A highly original and ingenious synthesis of concepts that feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of a magical brush, lost languages, and rousing kindness is fresh and organic. The risk-taking with poetic language and fantastical elements heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
