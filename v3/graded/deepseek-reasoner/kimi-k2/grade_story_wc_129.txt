<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to graft onto community is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her higher-stakes choice to collaborate. Her interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("ache in her chest was luminescent"). The final choice to weave the reeds is earned by prior causality, and her relationship with Fen acts as a crucible. Minor deduction for "boldly sympathetic" feeling slightly tell-y in one instance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid) as Lira finds kinship, with cost legible in the final image of the "translucent heart." The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building through pattern and detail. Orientation is immediate and purposeful. The structure is a single, coherent scene with a meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are indispensable, constraining choices (weaving through glass) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action. Spatial choreography is clear, and the setting evolves causally with the group's contributions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through density increase as others arrive, reweighting the stake of loneliness into kinship. Protagonist agency drives the escalation (Lira's decision to weave). Cost is visible in the transformed ache and the collective creation. One meaningful tightening is sufficient and well-executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of community and art emerges organically from events and images (the split reed glyph, the woven heart). Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The poetic voice is consistent and voice-motivated, heightening pressure without obscuring clarity. Dialogue, though brief, feels natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally controlled, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("frost caught mid-breath"). No loops, scaffold, or artifactual phrasing. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally and supports the emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of art, kinship, and ephemeral magic. Specific, verifiable detail creates authenticity. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight and is fully committed to.</comment>
