<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion (e.g., "knees stippled with sand"). The final renunciation—accepting the "unfinished"—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the erased word and vanishing shells. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously, as her reverence for the feather coexists with her acceptance of its frayed state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, crystallizing in the final image of the feather "writing invisible verses on the dark." The cost is legible in the erased word "unfinished" and the vanished shells. The lens holds throughout, with pattern breaks (gull's cry, snapped string) reweighting the stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon and drake's feather are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (e.g., "tasted salt and storm"). The environment pressures her actions, such as arranging shells against the encroaching tide, and the feather's incompleteness directly reveals the thematic sky.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, via her acts of tending and harmonizing. A meaningful cadence shift occurs when the snapped string is reweighted as "release." Cost is unmistakable in the tide's erasure of her word and the vanishing spiral, foreclosing the path of completion with felt loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of beauty in incompleteness, reweighting prior material (e.g., the burned letter, frayed feather) without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from images and actions, such as humming to harmonize discord, resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with a consistent lyric POV. Elision (e.g., the half-burned letter) is taught and paid off in the final realization. Diction remains within the poet's plausible lexicon, and syntax modulates purposefully with emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density and clear propulsion, with figurative language serving pattern and payoff (e.g., "frayed like unfinished lines of verse"). Minor risk of overwriting in peaks, but coherence holds without muddle. No loops or scaffold; sentence-level rhythm supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of incompleteness and beauty feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through grounded, particular details like the frayed feather and snapped string, avoiding derivative patterns.</comment>
