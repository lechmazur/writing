<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Naram-Sin’s frugality and devotion to measurement are consistent, embodied traits that compel his high-stakes choice to surrender his star-charts. His internal conflict between mistrusting gifts and trusting empirical data is dramatized in his nightly work. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries a visible, felt cost of personal glory for cosmic order.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis, reconfiguring his role from astronomer to custodian with a clear, felt cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through pattern density and a final cadence shift. The cost is legible in the final image of his "useless" lens and the memory of a sky he can no longer count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The palace setting is a dynamic, micro-setting that actively pressures choices and reconfigures itself. Key objects—the tile, the lens, the basalt plug—constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through the POV’s professional priorities, integrating seamlessly with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, through the deepening pattern of the tile’s permutations. The dominant stake (cosmic certainty) is tested and reweighted, forcing a trade-off with a high, visible cost. The final choice to sign the covenant narrows options and forecloses a path irrevocably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between empirical measurement and encrypted devotion, resisting a tidy moral. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the steady constellation and the palace’s song, reweighting the cost of knowledge and service without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, scholarly voice that modulates under pressure. The prose has a distinct texture and rhythmic control, with purposeful elision (e.g., the "diagrammed" voice) that is taught and paid off. Diction remains within the POV’s plausible lexicon, even at peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without muddle. A minor instance of template cadence ("wind through empty archways...") appears but does not harm closure clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of Babylonian astronomy, magic squares, and architectural allegory feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "encrypted devotion" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
