<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in her profession and personal history, with micro-choices under pressure (hesitation, then decisive infusion) revealing her values. The final smile and decision to open a salon feel earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the surrender of every gathered spark. Embodied emotion is strong, particularly in the frosty breath and pulsing chip against skin. The only minor flaw is a slight diagnostic tinge in "Finding patterns in static was her oldest habit," but it's quickly anchored in concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, focusing every gathered spark into a beam that reconfigures her purpose. The cost is legible in the empty grotto and the map etched in frost she now carries internally. Orientation is immediate and vivid ("skyborne grotto," "aurora above"). The lens holds perfectly: pattern density increases through memory and faces, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights the stake from preserving individual sparks to becoming a living vessel for them.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and threshold of stillness are not just descriptive but actively constrain and charge the central choice. The grotto's radiant hush deepens the silence, making her pulse seem distant, and the threshold "swallowed sound" and reflected nothing, forcing a purely visual and symbolic interaction. The emerald chip's green fire interacts directly with the setting, dimming the aurora. The final image of the map etched in frost is a powerful reconfiguration of the setting's initial "faint starlight."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The dominant stake (preserving last sparks vs. surrendering them) tightens through her hesitation, the unbidden memory, and the vision of the faces she's helped. This deepening changes her knowledge, revealing the threshold as a lens, not a door. The cost is unmistakable: surrendering every spark she's ever gathered, rendered in the vivid image of the collapsing threshold and the empty grotto.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of beauty, death, memory, and legacy, resisting any tidy moral. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: that preserving essence isn't about hoarding sparks but transforming them into an internal map to guide the living. The core concept of finding patterns in static is paid off brilliantly, evolving from a habit for recognizing grief to a means of transcending oblivion. The mother's salon memory perfectly seeds this thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a poetic, rhythmic cadence that modulates with emotional intensity ("radiant hush," "concentric rings, each ring a lifetime compressed"). The perceptual signature is unique—noticing the "geometry of grief," seeing faces in static. POV is stable and deeply filtered through the mortician's professional and personal lens. There is no dialogue, but none is needed; the internal voice carries the entire narrative weight with authority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is pristine, with high information density and zero loops or scaffolding. Every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and breathtakingly original ("spiral of wind," "pane of air that reflected nothing and swallowed sound"). Rhythm is masterful, accelerating with shorter clauses during the infusion and slowing for the resonant final lines. The read-aloud test would reveal a flawless, musical cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of beautician and mortician is brilliantly original and inextricable from the narrative logic. The core concept of a "threshold of stillness" is a fresh, non-obvious angle on a portal trope. The story commits fully to its premise, following the implications of its own rules with conceptual integrity. The choice to have her become a beacon for the living rather than cross into death is a specific, earned, and deeply satisfying inflection that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
