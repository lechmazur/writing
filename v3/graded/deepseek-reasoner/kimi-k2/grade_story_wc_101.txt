<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lila's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with micro-choices like ringing the bell twice revealing her leadership. Her final declaration is earned by prior causality, with embodied emotion and a visible cost in her persistent, weary action. The trait "gently persistent" is demonstrated, not stated, through her methodical distribution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the seeds and gathering reweighting the stake of cultural survival. The cost is legible in the final image of "moonlight glazing their faces the color of fired clay." Causality is tight, with the bell's sound and Tomasz's question deepening the thematic stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor constrains choice as the meeting point and resource depot, charging the final image. Sensory details like "wet clay and woodsmoke" are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lila's perception. The ridge itself functions as a character, "breathing beneath her feet," integrating setting with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lila's agency under the accumulative lens, with Tomasz's question serving as a deepening that tests her resolve. The cost is unmistakable in the "flour-dusted finger" touching the baby, a small price paid for intergenerational continuity. The stakes of cultural declaration are felt throughout, tightening with the arrival of the seeds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the midnight runs and the final seeds, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to survival. The note "For the season after" conceptualizes hope without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the bell touched to lips, and the ending reweights prior material through the image of planting tomorrow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive signature. Diction remains within Lila's lexicon, even under pressure. The prose rhythm varies purposefully, from the soft bell sound to the declarative final lines. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, as with Tomasz's whispered question.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and zero artifacts. Sentences advance story and atmosphere, like "amplified quiet that carried farther than shouting." Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, such as "moonlight glazing their faces." Rhythm is controlled, accelerating with the gathering and pausing with reverence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of exile, sanctions, and cultural preservation feels fresh and inevitable. The antique bell and midnight runs are specific, irreplaceable elements that heighten stakes. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure pays off with a charged, resonant closure. Emotional truth avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars.</comment>
