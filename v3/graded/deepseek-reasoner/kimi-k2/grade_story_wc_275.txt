<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's pacifism and desire for continuity are embodied through concrete micro-choices (burying the scrap, offering the rose). Her final choice feels earned, though the trait "senselessly perceptive" is more told than shown under pressure, costing a slight deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density and pattern breaks (tower fall, scavenger arrival). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the scavenger's fracture mirrors Lila's, with cost legible in the cracking pane and the offered rose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glass dome and sandbag soil are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The dome's fragility pressures Lila's tactics, and the patriarch rose roots the closure, fulfilling the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving continuity/quiet) are clear. Escalation is driven by Lila's agency under the accumulative lens: the scavenger's arrival forces a stance crystallization. The cost of her choice is felt in the cracked pane, though the external threat's resolution is slightly soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (quiet vs. chaos, continuity vs. loyalty) emerges organically from image and action. The final offer of the rose is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. The pacifist stance is complex, not simplistic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical voice that modulates under pressure. The prose's rhythmic control and selective perception ("engraved quiet," "tranquil blaze") are exceptional. Elision (e.g., father's exact fate) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense, precise, and propulsive, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language ("iron spine," "lantern," "burnt parchment") is consistent, vivid, and never muddles clarity, even in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm is masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-collapse sci-fi and pastoral elegy is fresh and specific. The core concept of "engraved quiet" is ingeniously realized. A slight risk is taken with the quiet, accumulative structure, which pays off but prevents a full 9.5+.</comment>
