<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion under pressure. The pilot's scar and the memory of failure create a live, contradictory impulse that charges the final choice. The final nod is an Earned Stasis that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that lands with felt cost in the final nod and the loosened weight on the ribs. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through sensory density and radio communication that narrows options. The persistent constraint of the past failure shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor and its equipment (parachute buckle, rope, rail) actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through professional POV. The environment evolves causally with the ship's approach and the cloud vortex.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with the cloud vortex and radio request forcing a revision of tactics. The cost is legible in the chest tightening and the final nod. A single meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the watcher's burden and the ritual of trust. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the charged image of the adjusted harness, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistently professional and inventive, with elision (e.g., the omitted apology) taught and paid off. Diction remains within the POV's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with figurative language that is pattern-taught and pays off. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with scene needs, accelerating with the ship's approach.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of aerial fantasy and psychological realism. Risk-taking in the dense, inventive prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
