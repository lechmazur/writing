<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("Loosened grief hung over the water like a mist"). The final choice to design a new polymer is earned by the on-page struggle and insight, with a visible cost in the vow to carry the chrysalis into meetings. The "symphonically minded" trait is fully integrated, shaping perception and the resulting design.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) as the protagonist's insight reweights her failure and purpose. The cost is legible in the final lines: lawsuits, scorn, and the uncertain hope for her sister's response. The river's patterns provide coherent, escalating pressure toward the epiphany.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The braided ravine is indispensable, actively constraining choice and supplying the core insight. The chrysalis and river foam are micro-settings that charge the final image and constrain the protagonist's thinking. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, fully filtered through the POV's professional and emotional lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in observing and interpreting the river's patterns, consistent with the accumulative lens. The dominant stake (atonement through redesign) is signaled early and tightens through her hours of watching, culminating in a design choice that forecloses her old path. The cost of this choice (lawsuits, scorn) is made legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of polymer science and river hydrology, resisting statement for resonant implication ("To atone is not to erase, I realized, but to keep listening until damage finds its counterpoint."). The final image of the swallows stitching the air offers a non-literal, profound answer to the central question of connection versus constraint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature that seamlessly blends scientific and symphonic lexicons. The prose's rhythm modulates perfectly with the protagonist's contemplative state. Purposeful elision (e.g., the specifics of the failure) is taught early and pays off, focusing the narrative on the emotional and conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistent, pattern-taught, and serves clarity ("swallows stitched the air with black seams"). A single minor register question near "unbroken day" prevents a higher score, but clarity and momentum are uncompromised.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of polymer chemistry and river ecology is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable. The core concept of a "divergent path" is transformed through grounded, character-driven choices and a non-obvious moral calculus. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coheres perfectly.</comment>
