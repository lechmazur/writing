<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The narrator's "forgiving skeptic" trait is embodied through concrete actions—pocketing the tooth, listening to Ari—creating a credible micro-choice hierarchy that culminates in the decision to "tell it plain." Linnet's "shrewdly innocent" trait enables the garden discovery but lacks the same depth of contradictory impulses under pressure. Ari's shame is viscerally rendered, and his final confession earns the Earned Stasis closure with a visible cost in his eroded state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the final image of stars as "bright bones" reweights prior mistakes into constellations. The tooth and map function as accumulating objects that charge the ending. Cost is legible in Ari's "eroded" state and the narrator's "ache of repairs." Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The garden is a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choices—the hidden door, the lattice where the tooth is found, the bench with the map. Sensory details like "mint and iron" and the fountain's "dialect" are filtered through the narrator's professional bias. The maze's rearrangement in the wind charges the final image of a "path out felt set."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift from doubt to a charged poise of mercy. The dominant stake (certainty vs. mercy) tightens through the discovery of the tooth and map, culminating in Ari's emergence and confession. Agency is the narrator's decision to believe and protect, foreclosing the town's blame path with a cost felt in the "ache of repairs."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central metaphor of "turning mistakes into constellations," avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights the premise: stars are "not omens, only witnesses," offering a non-literal answer that integrates Ari's map-drawing motive. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like pocketing the tooth and the exchanged nod between Ari and the narrator.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature marked by medical precision ("set more wrists than clocks") and poetic synthesis ("doubt is brave and memory tries on its old coats"). Diction remains within the narrator's lexicon even under pressure. The elision of the town's clamor is purposeful, teaching a pattern of selective attention that pays off in the quiet closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "Bone setting, like truth, hurts first and then holds" advances plot, theme, and character). Minimal scaffolding; almost every line advances the story. One minor risk: "nostalgic innovation" edges toward register drift but is anchored by the concrete "satchel" detail immediately following.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of bone-setting and celestial navigation is fresh and inevitable, transforming the changeling trope through psychological realism. The core concept of a "cleft in certainty" is made specific through the substitute body and the tooth. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure image is wholly original.</comment>
