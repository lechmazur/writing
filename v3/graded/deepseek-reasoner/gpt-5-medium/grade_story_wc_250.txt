<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's internal contradiction is embodied in damp palm and withheld secret versus desire to "teach darkness the value of stars." The guardian's silent empathy forces a micro-choice to accept the mirror, culminating in a felt cost as the protagonist's "voice returned like floodwater." Final choice to carry the light is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density increases through mirror/shutter weaving, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the protagonist angles light toward "drowned arches" and feels his brother "refusing the old pull." Cost is legible in the final image of the city feeling "slightly less alone."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, dental mirror, and shutters actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The dock's "footprints that fill and empty" mirror the protagonist's emotional state, while the guardian uses the environment to "open what had grown stuck." Specificity is woven into action, never ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stake is signaled early: the protagonist waits for answers at the dock where his brother vanished. Escalation is driven by the guardian's patterned actions, deepening the protagonist's emotional exposure until he reveals his secret. The cost is the unclenching of a "familiar door" in his chest, a felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the mirror is "for light too shy to arrive." The final image offers a non-literal answer—using light "when speaking failed"—that reweights the brother's suicide without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, deeply integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control ("spiralingly calm," "rain forgetting its fall"). Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off. POV is stable and deeply embodied, with syntax reflecting the protagonist's weighted emotional state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional line-level craft with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("voice returned like floodwater"). Syntax accelerates and breathes with scene needs, and every sentence advances story or atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of grief and light-weaving feels inevitable. Risk-taking in silent communication heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The dental mirror and shutter patterns are organically integrated, not checklist tropes.</comment>
