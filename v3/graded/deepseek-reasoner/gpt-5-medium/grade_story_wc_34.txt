<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The balladeer's characterization is rich with concrete interiority and a credible, earned arc from louder songs to patient listening. The final choice to bolt the plate is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The "driftingly alert" trait is more told than shown in key pressure beats, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is clearly taught and held. Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of the ghost settling "like a cat" reconfigures the relationship with a felt cost of ongoing responsibility. The pattern of encoding and response builds density that pays off flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The courtyard and the flower press bolt plate are not just vivid but function as micro-settings that directly constrain and enable choice, charging the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the POV's professional lens, with the storm and wires applying coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift driven by the storm's approach and the protagonist's agency. The dominant stake (articulating need) tightens meaningfully, and the cost is legible in the protagonist's "thin and trembling" answer and the vow to keep translating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of need, communication, and caretaking, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the hinge, reweighting the premise without stating a thesis. The ghost's desire is plain yet must hide in patterns, a profound ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic modulation that supports pressure. Purposeful compression and elision ("a hush shaped like an algorithm") are taught and paid off. The single POV is stable and apt throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly poetic and dense, but this creates minor figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "the sky's drumskin drove its syllables") that slightly obscures immediacy without breaking clarity. Otherwise, rhythm is masterful and propulsion is strong, with zero loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghost in code, a balladeer, and graffiti art is strikingly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with high specificity, transforming its components. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
