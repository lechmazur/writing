<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's dimensional homesickness is embodied through concrete micro-choices like showing empty hands and offering willingness to wait. Guardian's characterization is distinct through sensory details (vellum/salt scent) and status dynamics that pressure the protagonist's stance. Final interiorization of the garden feels earned by prior causality, though cost remains slightly conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong with pattern of interiorization escalating to closure. Orientation is deliberately disoriented but functional, teaching the pattern early. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) through the final interiorization act, reconfiguring the protagonist's relationship to uncertainty. Cost is legible in "the day is thinner for a breath" though slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Frozen garden and mist actively constrain choices and charge the final image—sundial's frozen shadow aligns boundaries, mist writes syllabus on sleeve. Sensory details are purposefully selective (light pools like breath, frostbite reading) and integrated into action. The garden functions as crucible where setting pressures force the protagonist's method of interiorization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens through density increase (pendant's revelation, frostbite reading) and cadence shift at offering to wait. Protagonist agency drives tightening through willingness to wait and interiorization practice. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—"day is thinner" implies price but lacks tangible weight. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of uncertainty friendship emerges through concrete actions (waiting, interiorizing) rather than statement. Final image of carrying thresholds like books offers resonant non-literal answer to homesickness. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures—empty hands offered, pendant weighing intent. Avoids moralizing; complexity resides in reciprocal relationship with uncertainty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled lyrical compression ("interiorizing exteriors", "foggy lucidity"). POV stability maintained through consistent metaphorical diction. Dialogue minimal but functional—guardian's speech carries subtext ("dialect of erasure"). Elision taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional prose density with every sentence advancing atmosphere or character. Figurative language coherent and pattern-taught ("interiorizing exteriors" returns transformed). Rhythm varies purposefully—long lyrical sentences balance shorter declarative ones. Minor risk of density in peak beats ("memory smokes like ice under pressure") but maintains clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of library, frozen garden, and dimensional homesickness concepts. Original voice with memorable phrases ("misfiled season", "dimensional homesickness"). Risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off with coherent closure. Premise transformed through specific details (cultist's pendant, off-season stars) rather than template plot.</comment>
