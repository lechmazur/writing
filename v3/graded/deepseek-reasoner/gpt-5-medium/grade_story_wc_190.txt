<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, especially in the operator's professional observations. The mathematician's embodied emotion ("hands rest on her lap betrays turbulence") and micro-choice to stop computing angles show credible struggle. Final renunciation is earned through the operator's deliberate slowing of the gondola, with visible cost in the storm glass clearing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern breaks (felt-wrapped notes, baffled wind) deepen stakes toward Charged Poise closure. Cost is legible in "shoulders loosen" and "equation is not about proof or grief." Minor deduction for slightly ambiguous lens early on, though it clarifies by midpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Storm glass vial constrains choice (operator uses it to guide actions) and charges the final image ("turns clear as winter morning"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("wind once screamed through, but I have hung baffles"). Setting pressures choices via noise levels and geometry of light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by operator's agency under Accumulative lens: dimming lights, opening windows, and slowing gondola deepen emotional stakes. Cost is felt in mathematician's shifted breathing and unclenched shoulders. One meaningful tightening (grief equation → air holding her) suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (storm glass, felt-wrapped notes) without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal answer: "motion now is kin to rest" reweights silence from absence to comfort. Subtext in "not speaking is not a wall but a window."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cities glint like pinned insects"); rhythmic control under pressure ("We remain in transit, but the motion now is kin to rest"). POV stable and voice coherent. Dialogue natural and goal-driven ("whether I can measure comfort").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density ("drifting prism terrace" does triple duty). Figurative language consistent and purposeful ("logic dreaming of color"). Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs. Read-aloud rhythm exquisite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of silence-as-comfort premise through specific worldbuilding (noise monitoring guild). Risk-taking in accumulative structure pays off with Charged Poise closure. Original angle on grief and mathematics avoids tropes.</comment>
