<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("an ache that never quite cleared its throat"). The final choice to stay and tend the trees is earned by prior causality of listening and rebuilding. A micro-choice to arrange bones "like notes in a hymn" reveals a hierarchy of values. The only minor deduction is for a slight diagnostic label ("purposeful wandering") though it is immediately dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the protagonist chooses to stay, foreclosing a return abroad with a visible cost of rootedness. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through layered images that culminate in the sundial's realignment. The cost is legible on the page in the final paragraph: "pruning interruptions so the fruit could travel." Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. The sundial base and pomegranate wood gnomon are micro-settings that directly enable the pivotal rebuilding action. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("smelled of leaves and turned pages"). The setting evolves from a place of death to a "library," mirroring the internal arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from documentation to active participation in rebuilding the sundial. This meaningful tightening reweights the dominant stake of restoring faith, foreclosing passive observation. The cost is felt in the commitment to stay and tend the orchard, a visible price paid. A single, decisive intensification is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of interrupted journeys finding completion emerges organically from the specific imagery of bones and seeds, the guide's stele, and the protagonist's own diaspora. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: faith is "rebuilt not by arresting time but by walking with it." Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like arranging bones "like notes in a hymn."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with a controlled, purposeful rhythm. The narrator's perceptual signature is strong ("time hesitate like a held breath"). Dialogue with Sami is natural, goal-driven, and carries distinct idiom. Brief elision (the transition to dusk) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor figurative density artifact appears in the high-pressure beat: "time hesitate like a held breath" followed closely by "starlings circled like punctuation" risks a slight muddle. This is a hairline slip that does not touch closure, but prevents a higher score under strict standards.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a catacomb orchard and a diaspora returnee's journey is a fresh, non-obvious angle. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, transformed through specific, grounded choices like rebuilding the sundial. The emotional truth and human complexity avoid generic templates, and the story commits fully to its premise.</comment>
