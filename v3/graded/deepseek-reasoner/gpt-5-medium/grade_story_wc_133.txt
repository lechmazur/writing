<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The painter's motivation ("to thresh meaning from experience") is clear and consistent, compelling a higher-stakes choice in the pact. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, though the emotional cost of the final exchange ("I steadied him with paint on my hands") could be more fully embodied. The keeper is a well-drawn secondary character applying immediate pressure. The final choice feels earned, but the cost, while present, is slightly under-realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held consistently. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) via the pact, which reconfigures the characters' relationship with the island. Causality is strong, with the brooch discovery leading directly to the keeper's appearance and the pact. The cost is legible but could be more visceral; the final image of the pact being "pinned to the lighthouse with salt" is conceptually charged but slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tidal island is indispensable, pressuring choices and supplying resources (the rain trails, the convergence seam). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("flats slicked with last night's retreat," "puddles filmed over with sky"). The environment constrains choice and charges the final image, with the convergence seam functioning as a micro-setting that is central to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (extracting meaning/preserving memory) is signaled early. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres and deepens through a single meaningful cadence shift—the pact—which reweights the stake and forecloses other paths (e.g., selling finds). The cost of the exchange (losing the "tiny held storm") is conceptually clear but could be more felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (exchange, memory, meaning) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the pact and its consequences. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, such as the keeper's silent weeping and the mother's request for an "exchange we could bear."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The voice is consistent, lyrical, and purposefully compressed ("prayer tasted like rust and brine"). Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries significant subtext ("what the island had given me today"). Any elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with excellent rhythm and variation. However, a tendency toward complex figurative language in high-pressure beats ("like knives newly honest about their work") creates minor moments of opacity that slightly slow momentum. There are no significant loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. Information density is very high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting, lyricism, and a focus on memory and artifact feels fresh and non-obvious. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. The final reconfiguration (the pact) feels inevitable in hindsight and arises from established pattern and character choice.</comment>
