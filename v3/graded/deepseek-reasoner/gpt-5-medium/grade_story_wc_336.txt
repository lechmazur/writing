<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Miren's motivation is clear, rooted in a consistent trait of preserving memory, and intensifies with the child's arrival. Her internal conflict between duty and creative yearning is embodied in micro-choices, like tilting the seed and touching the bough. The final choice to plant the seed is earned by prior causality, foreclosing a path with the visible cost of her effort and the child's promise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres through density increase and a cadence shift with the child's arrival, which deepens the central stake of failing memory. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the planted seed reconfigures the valley's options with a felt cost—the effort to "keep a path swept." The lens holds, and a persistent constraint (forgetfulness) shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is integral, not ornamental. The parapet and waterfall pressure choices (e.g., the mist-beaded seam for planting) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Miren's professional POV, as in the scent of "bread learning to rise" from a cut. The mossed stone and heirloom seed are recurring objects that constrain choice and resonate at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving wonder) is signaled early and escalates under the Accumulative lens through the child's arrival, a meaningful deepening that changes Miren's knowledge and tactics. Protagonist agency drives the escalation—her choice to engage the child and later plant the seed. The cost is legible in the final image of the valley "remember[ing] to breathe," a reweighting earned by on-page effort.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete events—the pruning, the seed's hunger, the child's story—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of memory's erosion: "It was not a miracle, only the careful work..." Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image, like the seed drawing down "the chair's loneliness."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice that modulates under pressure ("Wind braided mist into her hair"). The single line of dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., "weaving between worlds") are taught early and paid off at closure without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. A minor figurative overload occurs in the peak beat ("color of wonder itself, which time tries to bleach from sight"), slightly muddying clarity, but it does not harm closure. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere without loops or scaffolding. Read-aloud rhythm is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of orchard-tending and memory-keeping feels fresh, inevitable, and highly specific. The core concept of "weaving between worlds" is transformed through grounded, tactile detail rather than remaining abstract. Risk-taking in the lyrical voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the vision coheres as a singular artistic stance.</comment>
