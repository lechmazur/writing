<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ghost bride's "lovingly venomous humor" and the keeper's micro-choices under her ephemeral guidance reveal complex, contradictory impulses. Her final lesson and fading charge the keeper's vow with visible cost, earning the Earned Stasis closure. The keeper's flawed promise and subsequent transformation feel rooted in established character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens dominates, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the orchard learning to "warm its own dark." The cost is legible in the keeper's mournful elation and the ghost's final vanishing "as a note disappears." The pattern of ephemeral appearances and the bead's integration create a coherent, inevitable escalation toward this charged ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "alchemical orchard greenhouse" is not just atmospheric but a crucible that actively constrains and enables choices, pressuring the keeper's methods. The "carved stone bead" and "graft scars" function as micro-settings, charging the final image and directly causing the resonant awakenings. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the protagonist's perception and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift initiated by the bead striking the soil, which "quivered like a closed eye learning light." This meaningful deepening reweights the dominant stake of awakening the orchard, driven by the ghost's agency and the keeper's promise. The cost is felt in the "mournful elation" of their final exchange and the keeper's enduring vow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment>The theme of debt, memory, and repayment emerges organically from the specific image of the "bridge of years" and the "ferry" of the stone bead, resisting any direct statement. The final, resonant answer—"the answer is the orchard waking to sing"—is a non-literal reconfiguration that grows from prior particulars. The story's emotional aftereffect is complex and earned, avoiding sentimentality or moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The voice possesses a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature with controlled rhythmic variation that heightens pressure, evident in lines like "frost breathed inward" and "smoke fleeing the ache of wood." Purposeful elision (the ghost's origins) is taught early and pays off at closure. The POV is stable, and the ghost's dialogue carries a unique, venomous tenderness that distinguishes her from the keeper's internal voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits exceptional density and propulsion, with figurative language that is consistently coherent and purpose-driven, serving character and closure ("veil curled to the floor with the relief of someone finishing a long letter"). There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. The opening and closing lines anchor and resolve the piece with powerful, recharging imagery. Read-aloud rhythm is masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemical greenhouse, ghost bride, and resonant awakenings is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is fully committed to and followed through with conceptual integrity, transforming its elements through specific, grounded choices. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without ever becoming a gimmick or obscuring clarity.</comment>
