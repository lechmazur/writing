<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and rooted in a unique occupation, compelling higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation ("We did not cheer") is an Earned Stasis foreclosing a path with visible cost. A slight deduction for a minor instance of telling motivation ("to salvage something pure") rather than fully dramatizing it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a felt cost of quiet, non-violent justice. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with escalation driven by pattern density (the tapping) and a cadence shift (the communal listening). The cost is legible on the page in the foreman's swallowed confession and the husband's quiet visit. The structure is taut, with a single, meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The shrine and the snow globe are micro-settings that powerfully constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through the POV's professional bias ("language of silt, steel, and memory"). The environment is fully integrated into action and is indispensable to the plot's logic and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens is driven by the protagonist's agency in decoding and sharing the pattern. A single, decisive intensification occurs when the community gathers to listen, reweighting the dominant stake of truth with a clear cost (the company's exposure). Pressure coheres and grows from a personal investigation to a communal act of justice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images (windows, tapping, globe) concerning truth, memory, and gentle justice. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the resting globe. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, avoiding any direct moralizing. The core concept is fully integrated into the thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is exceptionally distinct, with a controlled, lyrical, and rhythmic texture that modulates with pressure ("breath makes halos and prayers drift like plankton"). The perceptual signature is unique and consistent. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a single, minor figurative muddle: the phrase "the ship blushed" slightly violates the established concrete logic of metal and water, creating a momentary coherence slip in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, the language is precise, vivid, and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise of a wreck-diver ghost whisperer is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of elements is organic and highly specific, avoiding tropes. Bold risk-taking in the lyrical voice and accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The story commits fully to its singular artistic vision.</comment>
