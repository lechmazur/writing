<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is precise and embodied; her "softly deliberate gait" and the river stone's weight reveal her nature through action. Her choice to trade her stored dreams for Ilen's healing is a high-stakes renunciation earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the empty casing of her unlived life. Contradictory impulses—leaning toward sorrow yet preserving hope—act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Mira accepts the cost of her trade, reconfiguring her purpose. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern breaks (vines tightening) and a cadence shift (light washing) reweight the stake. Cost is legible in "the empty casing where her dreams had been." Causality is tight; the library's jealousy and Mira's bargain flow from established rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The library is micro-setting that constrains choice (vines tightening around the aisle) and charges the final image (blossoms inking her name). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("pages bloomed with dew," "light rained from the rafters"). Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment evolves with the plot, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a decisive intensification: the library's resistance (vines tightening) forces Mira's costly trade. Agency is clear in her renunciation, which narrows options and forecloses a path with felt cost. The dominant stake (healing Ilen vs. preserving self) tightens meaningfully, and the price is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: the trade of "luminous regret" for "hope" is a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in gesture (shadow writing looping questions) and implication (the stone's testimony). Complexity is embraced; hope is preserved but paid for with specific, nourishing loss, resisting tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct; Mira's perceptual signature ("trained by years of listening to colors fade") filters the world. Prose rhythm is controlled under pressure, with purposeful compression ("joy arrive carrying luminous regret"). Diction remains within her lexicon; elision (e.g., the exact language whispered to leaves) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but rarely muddy; figurative language serves pattern and payoff ("petal storm that sounded like careful applause"). Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs, accelerating in tension and breathing in resolution. No loops or scaffold; clarity is maintained even in peak beats, though some phrases border on overwriting without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of library, dreams, and unbound shadow feels fresh and organic. The core premise is transformed through grounded choices—Mira's trade, the stone's function—that heighten stakes. Risk-taking in lyrical density coheres into a singular vision; the ending feels inevitable yet inventive, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
