<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and deeply personal, rooted in childhood memory and professional duty. The final choice to photograph rather than interfere is an Earned Stasis that feels inevitable, foreclosing a path with visible cost ("the crater and the summit and the moon conspired to make my throat clean and still"). Embodied emotion is specific and avoids diagnostic language.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through layered imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on the page with undeniable cost in the final image of the moth's ascent and the narrator's stillness. The lens holds perfectly, with the dawning hush acting as a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake of preservation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The moonlit summit is a micro-setting that actively pressures the protagonist's choices and charges the final image. The crater's rim, the seam of ancient snow, and the radio array are not just described but constrain tactics and frame the climactic moment. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through a professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the timed chemical messages creating a coherent, tightening pressure toward the dawn. The cost is legible and felt in the final beats as the moth departs and the narrator accepts the loss. The dominant stake of capturing the "last of something precious" is tested and paid for.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between preservation and progress, memory and loss. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the photograph outlasting the subject but not the hush, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The moth's song and the Nightwatch's purpose are particulars that charge the thematic question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control that modulates with emotional intensity. The voice is consistent and apt, blending professional observation with poetic reflection. Purposeful elision (e.g., the agency's exact nature) is taught and pays off, focusing the narrative on the personal stake.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is precise and coherent, serving character and atmosphere without muddying clarity. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. The final paragraph is a model of concision and resonant closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core concept of documenting extinction on the moon is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of familiar themes. The specific choice of glacier moths and chemical messaging feels organic and irreplaceable. Risk-taking in the quiet, lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
