<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("root-bound visionary," "purposefully curious"). The final choice to refuse the gardeners and offer a new vow is earned by prior causality, with visible cost recorded in cambium. The woman's arrival and their linked scars create a crucible relationship that forces the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (leaning Accumulative/Textural) holds. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the maze becomes "a grammar, teaching us how to say yes without erasing no," reweighting the premise with undeniable cost. The final image of the crossroads is legible and resonant, charged by the prior pattern of hedges and scars.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cobalt glade, mapletree grafts, and maze clipping are not just vivid but essential, constraining choice and charging the final image. The glade's "blue hour" and the pool that holds "reflections that did not belong to either of us" are purposefully woven into the climax and resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Hybrid lens: the choice to link scars, heed the leaves, and refuse the gardeners. The cost is unmistakable—"our joined pain," the agreement "recorded in cambium." A single, meaningful tightening from personal curiosity to a braided, communal vow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of broken promises and new beginnings through the image of the maze as "a grammar." Theme emerges organically from the eclipsed covenant, the linking of scars, and the final reconfiguration, resisting tidy morals for complex synthesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled, poetic compression ("leaf-veins lit with residual lightning from tomorrow"). Purposeful elision is taught and paid off at closure. The woman's dialogue carries subtext and advances the plot naturally. Internal voice remains coherent and specific under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density and rhythmic control, though some figurative language in high-pressure beats ("a ribbon pulled from a mouth") risks slight coherence loss. No loops or scaffold. Prose is precise and propulsive, with sentences doing multiple jobs without obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of botanical graft, temporal rupture, and bodily cartography feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in dense, lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
