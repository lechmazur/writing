<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong embodied emotion ("grief kept finding the gap between stories and sleep"). The final choice to reprice the scrap is earned by prior causality, though a minor slip occurs in the peak beat with "asked permission to believe," which edges toward diagnostic self-awareness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) that lands on the page with undeniable cost ("keep a rock not for hardness but for echo"). The accumulative lens holds perfectly, with memories and objects building pressure toward the final, decisive reweighting of value.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The quarry setting and the speaker grille cloth scrap are indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's perception and the narrative's emotional logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the accumulative pressure of memories and objects, culminating in the protagonist's agency to reprice the scrap. The cost is legible and felt, though the tightening is more of a deepening than a narrowing of options, which is sufficient for the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of memory and purpose emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. The final image of the "echo valley" reweights prior material without moralizing, offering profound thematic closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and impeccable rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistent, and the patterned elision of memories is taught early and pays off brilliantly at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though one mixed metaphor ("evaporated applause") slightly muddles sense in an otherwise flawless execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a roadie's past and an appraiser's present feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded detail and a non-obvious moral calculus, resulting in a singular and authentic artistic stance.</comment>
