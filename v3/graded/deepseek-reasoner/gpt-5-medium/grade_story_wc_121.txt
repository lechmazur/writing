<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. The final choice to "surrender gravity" is earned by prior causality, though the "gravity defier" trait feels slightly more thematic than a constraint that actively complicates choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that lands with undeniable cost on the page: "subtraction made room for something else, a corridor inside me." The pattern of procedural generation is taught early and pays off decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The viaduct and clay tablet are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The setting is a crucible, with puddles prescribing a sequence and the tablet's runes aligning to reveal the protagonist's own handwriting, directly shaping the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift and density increase that reweights the dominant stake. The pressure to follow the "generated pattern" coheres and tightens, forcing the stance crystallization of surrender, with cost legible in the final subtraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of self-conquest through surrender emerges organically from the core concept and specific imagery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material: "to stand by letting go." It avoids moralizing, earning its wisdom through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and masterful rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is singular and consistent, with purposeful elision and compression that serves the accumulative design. The lyric mode is taught early and paid off at closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exceptionally high information density and poetic propulsion, but a minor figurative overload in high-pressure beats ("fractured timelines fanned beneath my feet, slippery mosaics") creates a slight muddle, preventing a 9+ score. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A rare, fully integrated synthesis of concept (procedural generation), character (periodically eternal), and theme (labyrinth of self). The combination feels organic and inevitable, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The specific, non-obvious angle on self-conquest is exceptional.</comment>
