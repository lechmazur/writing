<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is clear and deeply integrated with their method ("listening until sound remembered mercy"). Their micro-choices—placing the wing, tracing the water, measured breathing—are consistent and reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation feels earned, with cost legible in the "careful drift between danger and mercy."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural drive lens is dominant, with pressure escalating through pattern density and a decisive cadence shift ("the code untied like wet shoelaces"). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the future is reconfigured through silence, with cost felt in the "exhaled" future and the summoner's vow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The brook and origami wing function as micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("brook ran with sleeping stars," "moon threw a ladder"). The environment is inseparable from the conflict, shaping tactics and the story's resonant closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the summoner's agency under the Accumulative lens, through the deepening pattern of the water's "arithmetic." The dominant stake (preventing an iron noon) is tested and reweighted with a visible cost: the code's dissolution and the world's subtle but complete change ("like water after stone is lifted").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges masterfully from image and action, not statement. The core concept of "mapping silence" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict. The final image of the wing as a "little paper universe" reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature ("inward constellations," "paper thunder"). The lyrical, compressed prose is voice-motivated and pattern-taught, with rhythmic control that heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "terrestrially cosmic shimmer"), where figurative language risks mild obscurity. However, clarity is never broken, and momentum is sustained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of summoner, origami, and silence feels fresh, inevitable, and highly specific. The core concept is transformed through grounded, particular choices. Risk-taking in the lyrical mode heightens stakes and coherence, and the closure effect remains perfectly legible.</comment>
