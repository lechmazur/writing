<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; embodied emotion ("his smile tries to be casual but lands on weary") and a final micro-choice (calling the board) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The caretaker's transformation from weary complicity to "gentle astonishment" is a secondary pressure that deepens the central conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing of the device's power, landing with cost ("the downstairs printer shudders to a halt"). The wager structure provides a clear because/therefore linkage, and the final act reconfigures the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory setting is a micro-setting that pressures choices and charges the final image; the "great lens" and its closure are tactile constraints. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("wind that smells like snow and old photographs"), filtered through a professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens; the wager is a single meaningful tightening that forces a trade-off. The cost is legible in the stalled printer and hiccupping exchanges, though the felt price on the characters is slightly more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and event, not statement; the final act offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of truth and power. The "orbits of regret" concept is integrated into the caretaker's dialogue, enriching the thematic weight without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure; purposeful elision (the journalist's fate) is taught and paid off. The POV's professional lexicon ("proof by contradiction") remains consistent and voice-motivated, even at peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density and clear propulsion, though occasional dense metaphors ("like a gull in netting") slightly slow momentum. No loops or scaffold; syntax accelerates with scene needs ("The great lens closes like an eyelid"). A minor figurative muddle in one beat prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of media critique and astronomical metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, with bold risk-taking in the lyric-resonant structure.</comment>
