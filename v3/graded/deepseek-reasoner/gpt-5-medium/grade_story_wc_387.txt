<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a desire to appreciate hidden effort. Embodied emotion is strong ("coaxing grief into spirals"), and micro-choices under pressure, like offering silence instead of fireworks, reveal character. A minor deduction for a slight lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through pattern and density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands on the page with undeniable conceptual cost as the crowd participates in mending. The final image of dawn and the gifted whisk reconfigures the meaning of effort.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is a character; the whispering parapet, rain, and fireflies actively pressure the protagonist's choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, fully integrated into action and perception ("Water threads along the stone lip, murmuring like apprentices"). The bamboo whisk constrains choice and charges the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in demonstrating his philosophy, culminating in the crowd's participation. The cost of his unconventional choice is legible in the councilor's initial skepticism and subsequent transformation. A single, meaningful cadence shift reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges masterfully from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of hidden effort through the final acts of the crowd. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, such as the councilor using his sash to dry the stones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct, consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Purposeful elision is taught and paid off. A minor register drift occurs in phrases like "scintillatingly somber choir," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a minor accumulation in high-pressure beats ("scintillatingly somber choir," "dim nebula") prevents a perfect score. Read-aloud rhythm is superb.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a net-mender philosopher using a tea ceremony to demonstrate the value of hidden effort is a fresh, non-obvious, and fully integrated concept. The story commits fully to its premise, and the risk-taking with a quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coherence.</comment>
