<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., tracing grain, pressing the seam) revealing a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation of descent is earned by prior causality, maintaining "necessary distances" with visible cost. Father's absence limits on-page relationship dynamics, but single-POV depth compensates.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) via Conceptual Repricing: the threshold becomes a "companion" through maintained distance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern breaks (logbook codes aligning with grain) escalating stakes. Cost is legible in the ache of withheld reunion, shaping the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The terrace functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (e.g., the seam requiring specific pressure to activate). Sensory detail is purposefully selective (wind smelling of "sugar glass"), and spatial choreography is coherent. The bench's grain directly charges the final image by storing storm memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: analyzing grain, aligning codes, and pressing the seam each deepen knowledge and narrow options. Cost is felt in the enduring "ache" of separation, which reweights the stake of connection without closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action (e.g., "calm is a door that refuses to say which side is inside"). The ending offers a non-literal answer to sacred thresholds via "measure that keeps them from collapsing." No moralizing; complexity resides in the father's ambiguous sacrifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("moon withheld its map"). Lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure. Diction remains within the narrator's lexicon even under pressure, with rhythmic control enhancing atmospheric density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with figurative language serving pattern accumulation (e.g., "prism taught by drifting"). No loops or scaffold; syntax varies naturally with scene needs. Minor register elevation in "featherly determined" is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of maze architecture, weather codes, and prism physics feels inevitable. Risk-taking in abstract concepts ("necessary distances") is grounded in character-specific struggle. Premise transforms the search narrative through non-obvious moral calculus on separation.</comment>
