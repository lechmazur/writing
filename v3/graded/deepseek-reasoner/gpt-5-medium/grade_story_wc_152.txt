<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., pricking finger to dab thread with blood) revealing values. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, though the keeper's characterization remains slightly thinner, costing a half-point.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with cost legible in the final image of the candle set to watch. Minor orientation delay in the first paragraph is waived as it serves the lyrical, disorienting tone that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. The cobalt observatory, eternal candle, and embroidery tools are tactile and integrated into action. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the embroiderer's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the stitching process tightening the stakes. Cost is felt when the cloth "suffers" and threads snap, though the final cost is more conceptual than visceral, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of listening, truth, and disguise. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the candle watching, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive signature. Some dense figurative language in peak beats creates minor opacity, but the pattern is taught and paid off, and elision serves the closure effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor artifact: a slight register drift in "synchronize them with a timid fingertip and a prayer" feels slightly elevated for the voice, and a paraphrase loop occurs in adjacent lines about listening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of embroidery, astronomy, and political conspiracy is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the voice is singular and authentic.</comment>
