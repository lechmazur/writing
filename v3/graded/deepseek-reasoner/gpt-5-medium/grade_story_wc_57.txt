<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's patient attention is embodied through concrete micro-choices like humming to ease a splice, with the final seed-blessing proving earned agency. The philosophical role avoids diagnostic speech, instead showing through tactile interaction with rope and seeds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the harbor "keeps" them, with cost legible in the rewrapped rope and bundled seeds. Orientation is immediate and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The fulgurite glass and rope function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through professional priority (e.g., "rope remembers").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens—the hidden splice resists, yielding time and new knowledge. Cost is visible in the rewrapped rope and the act of whispering lessons to seeds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the decoding act; the final image of the harbor "keeping" them offers a non-literal answer about preservation and attention without moralizing. Subtext operates in knots and gestures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled rhythmic prose ("patient, granular, promising"). POV is stable and voice-motivated compression ("a tidal scripture") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High information density with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent ("lightning-made root of sand"). Syntax accelerates and breathes with scene needs, clarity untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of seed-collecting and knot-decoding feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No template echoes; specificity anchors the vision.</comment>
