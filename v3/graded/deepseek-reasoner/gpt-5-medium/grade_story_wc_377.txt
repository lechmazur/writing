<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iri's seasonal muteness is a masterful, embodied trait that informs her entire being and method, not a label. Her final choice to guard the shard is a micro-choice of renunciation that reveals her hierarchy of values, with the cost of "restrained force" felt on the page. Her competence is balanced with genuine struggle against the Keepers' fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the Keepers depart changed, leaving Iri in her earned stasis. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, escalating through density of image and sound until the symphonies assemble. Cost is legible in the Keeper's fallen hand and Iri's trembling fingers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment is the quintessential micro-setting, a recurring object that constrains choice (Iri guards it) and decisively charges the final image (cradled, humming). The bluff and sculptures are tactile, lived-in environments that pressure the action. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift—the playing of the symphony—that reweights the dominant stake (wonder vs. fear) with cost. The pressure from the Keepers is coherent and forces Iri's stance crystallization. The cost of her guardianship is felt in her trembling, a visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of wonder versus institutional capture emerges entirely through event and image, most powerfully in the final symphony the Keepers hear. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the charged poise of Iri's continued vigil. No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, a perceptual signature of poetic precision that remains consistent under pressure. The elision of direct dialogue is a purposeful, pattern-taught choice that serves the theme and pays off. POV is stable, and the prose-as-character reflects Iri's tuned, attentive consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush but purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor risk of overwriting in the density of figurative language ("like a sleeping throat," "like furled clouds") is present but does not obscure closure clarity. No loops, scaffold, or artifactual phrasing. The read-aloud rhythm is exquisite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A singularly original synthesis of concept, character, and setting. The core premise of a seasonally mute bell tuner using kinetic sculptures to answer questions is wholly fresh and organic. The risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes and coherence, resulting in a memorable and authentic artistic stance.</comment>
