<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's "persistent curiosity" is a flaw that drives the plot, and the final choice to facilitate connection is earned by prior causality. Embodied emotion is strong, particularly the tactile detail of the hearing aid "warm in my palm like a pocketed sparrow." A slight deduction for the late introduction of the man, whose full motivation is revealed via summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the three characters are united in a "reeling hush," reconfiguring the meaning of connection and listening. The inferred Hybrid lens holds, blending causal tracing with accumulative texture. The cost is legible in the final, quiet image of shared vulnerability. The plot's central reversal—the man is the true caller—is perfectly foreshadowed and reweights all prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is integral to the plot and theme. The "mist-clad atrium" establishes tone, while the "gallery of unclaimed photographs" functions as a micro-setting that directly constrains the choice to search and ultimately charges the final image. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and filtered through the POV's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Hybrid lens. The protagonist's choice to physically follow the pulses is a major tightening that narrows options and leads to the climactic discovery. The cost is the emotional weight of navigating another's profound grief, which is felt on the page and alters the protagonist's final stance from tracer to facilitator.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from the particulars of the plot—the nature of connection, listening, and "incidental heroism" is answered by the final, resonant image without moralizing. The core concept is fully integrated, and the ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question of how we find each other.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent, with a poetic yet grounded perceptual signature. The prose's rhythm modulates perfectly with emotional intensity. A minor, single-instance register drift ("like exhausted mailmen" feels slightly incongruent) prevents a higher score, but the POV is otherwise stable and compelling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance multiple jobs of story, character, and atmosphere. One minor artifact: the phrase "improve the answer" is a slight abstraction in a key beat. Otherwise, the line-level writing is pristine and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise of a "contact tracer for hearts" is brilliantly original and fully committed to. The synthesis of the mundane (bureaucratic logging) and the magical (calls from the dead) feels organic and inevitable. The specific, grounded execution through the hearing aid and photographs transforms a high-concept idea into a deeply human story.</comment>
