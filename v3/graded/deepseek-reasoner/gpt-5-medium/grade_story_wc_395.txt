<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The memory keeper's motivation is vividly embodied and intensifies under pressure, compelling high-stakes choices. The final choice to surface Aida's files feels earned by prior causality and shows visible cost through the risk to her job. The trait "brightly attentive" manifests in concrete actions like noticing the recurring numbers and lying to the access bot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change with clear cost: the keeper risks her job to give Aida voice. The causal lens holds strongly, with each beat logically following the previous. The final image of rerouting the stream provides a resonant reconfiguration of the archive's purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The social network archive setting actively pressures choices and supplies key resources. The recurring numbers and mission patch object charge the final image and constrain the protagonist's path. Sensory details like "cold air smelling like old servers" are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from noticing patterns to lying for access to finally posting Aida's files. The cost is unmistakable in the risk to her job. The dominant stake of finding truth tightens meaningfully through each choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully through concrete particulars - the numbers, the patch, the audio file - without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about memory and preservation. The final image of rerouting streams conceptually reprices the archive's purpose with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with poetic yet precise diction. The voice remains consistent under pressure, blending technical and lyrical registers. Purposeful compression serves the theme without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional prose density with every sentence advancing multiple purposes. Figurative language ("like archivists sweeping a beach") is taught early and pays off. No loops or scaffold issues. Rhythm varies naturally with scene needs, particularly in the vault discovery sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of digital archiving and space disaster mourning feels organic and inevitable. The recurring numbers motif transforms a common trope through specific implementation. Risk-taking in lyrical-technical voice heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
