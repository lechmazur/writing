<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in a desire for truth, with embodied interiority ("instincts calibrated by tides") and micro-choices under pressure (using the hook, prying the box). The final stance of serene upheaval is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the reconfiguration of understanding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density and pattern toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with cost ("a path still asks to be walked"), and the persistent constraint of the water and time shapes the final image. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The canal setting actively pressures choices (navigating, salvaging) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully woven through action ("a grating complaint rose through the water"). The pocket sundial and lockmaster steps function as micro-settings that constrain tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening as the hook finds metal and the box is opened. The cost is legible in the moment of hindsight clarity arriving "as a tide," reweighting the dominant stake of truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with the final reconfiguration offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of lies and truth. The ending avoids moralizing, instead achieving a conceptual repricing through the concrete particulars of maps and ledgers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful elision (e.g., the meeting with the engineer) that pays off. POV is stable and voice is consistent, with a lyrical yet precise diction that reflects the character's mindset.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High information density and clear propulsion, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("hindsight clarity arrived not as a knife but as a tide"). Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally to support the accumulative build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of a salvage operation with a conceptual quest for truth. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
