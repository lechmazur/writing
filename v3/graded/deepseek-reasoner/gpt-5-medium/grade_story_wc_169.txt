<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("I felt our days tipping toward repair"). Micro-choices under pressure reveal values, and the final renunciation is earned. Slight deduction for parallel selves converging in voice under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost ("I felt our days tipping toward repair"). Orientation is immediate; pattern-teaching is flawless. Persistent constraint (gauge) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Grotto and gauge function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("tide-polished grotto", "stones shining like answers"). Environment actively guides the protagonist's actions and decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's pattern-making under accumulative lens; cost is legible in the final reconfiguration of hope. Pressure coheres through density increase of trial balloons. One meaningful deepening sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from pattern-making and gauge use; ending offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through imagery ("serene upheaval"). Avoids thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure; POV stable and voice consistent. Elision (parallel timelines) taught early and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; figurative language purposeful and pattern-taught. Minor deduction for slight density in high-pressure beats ("lucidly watchful" repetition), but no loops or artifacts harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of pattern-making and parallel timelines; risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Concept fully committed to and executed with specificity. Transforms familiar tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
