<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interior contradiction ("confidently uncertain") is embodied throughout. The final choice to write furrows is earned by prior causality of shame over the failed seeds, with visible cost in the wrist ritual and the station's groan. The relationship with Del acts as a crucible, forcing the protagonist's stance to crystallize.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through density of image and concept until the final Conceptual Repricing of "editing history." Closure lands on-page with cost ("the scrap tugged... resisting") and the persistent constraint of the Quiet's gravity shapes the final tactic. The pen's use is a decisive physical act that reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly (micro-setting) actively pressures choices, warping time and conversation. The fountain pen (object-as-setting) constrains the final choice and charges the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV's professional and personal bias (e.g., "warping clocks, tea, and sometimes conversations").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: the shame over the failed seeds deepens, compelling the unauthorized use of the pen. The cost is legible in the physical resistance of the scrap and the station's groan. A single meaningful tightening—from receiving the message to attempting to edit—forecloses the option of passive interpretation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of editing history emerges from events and images (the pen, the broadcast, the furrows) rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the shipped seeds, reweighting the protagonist's guilt without moralizing. The core concept integrates fully with the character's internal arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are maintained under pressure ("Words arrived like migrants, slow and careful"). The POV is stable and the voice's blend of the unearthly and bureaucratic is consistent. Purposeful elision (how editing works) is taught and paid off in the final image of the addendum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("like a blanket that remembers several winters"). A minor scaffold exists in the adjacent sentences about trading farms for stars and the station precessing, creating a slight paraphrase loop (-0.2).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial communication, gravitational physics, and the metaphysics of editing history is specific and non-obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is committed to fully and followed to its implications. The voice is a singular artistic stance, avoiding template plots and generic metaphors.</comment>
