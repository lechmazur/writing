<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in his "respectfully rebellious" trait, intensifying when he chooses to stay for Mina. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in reactions like "my arm hairs rise as if saluting thunder." The final choice to deliver the letter is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in his altered posture and the story's final image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through layered imagery toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where the protagonist understands his method of "linking absences" as healing. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. The closure lands on-page with cost in the boy's changed posture and the final image of "maps exhaling."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated, with the thunderstorm jar and the cobalt arcade constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the mailman's professional POV. The environment evolves causally, from the "brittle hush" to the arcade "glows cobalt and soft, as if forgiven."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fostering connection) is signaled early and escalates under the accumulative lens through the encounter with Mina, which deepens the protagonist's understanding and narrows his options. The cost is legible in his decision to stay and the subsequent delivery, which alters tactics and charges the final image with felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, particularly the jar and the method of "linking absences," culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to healing broken promises. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, such as Mina's thumbprint "shaped like a crescent." The ending offers a conceptual repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature evident in phrases like "alleys where maps hold their breath." Diction and syntax are consistently controlled and voice-motivated, even under pressure. Purposeful elision (e.g., the plea's exact wording) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences doing multiple jobs without padding. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. There are no loops or scaffold artifacts; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere with clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of the mailman trope with a magic-realist conflict zone, transformed through specific, grounded choices. The core concept of "linking absences" feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
