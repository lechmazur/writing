<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied micro-choices under pressure (e.g., uncorking moonlight for proofreading). The final choice to offer "returned regrets" is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost as the plinth sighs. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously—seeking beginnings while bearing the weight of forgiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the comma-seed crystallizes "maybe" with cost legible in the plinth's sigh. Orientation is clear by ~120 words; the method of "quantifying absence" is taught early and pays off. The hinge in empty air is a decisive image that reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image: the glass orchard library and bottled moonlight enable the incising method, and the comma-seed's weight reconfigures the ending. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "floorboards creak like timid prologues"). Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: the method of quantifying absence tightens pressure through density increase (counting beats, dust, breaths). Cost is unmistakable as the plinth sighs under the seed's weight. The dominant stake (finding story beginnings) is tested and reweighted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions (e.g., "beginnings shaped like blanks"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the comma-seed, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and implication ("read the nowhere").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure (e.g., "lull stretched, a narrow bridge of hour between clouds"). Purposeful compression and patterned elision (quantifying absence) are taught early and paid off. POV is stable and voice remains coherent through peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; figurative language is pattern-taught and functional (e.g., "vow to demonstrate silence"). Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "apple trembled as though listening for an edit") slightly obscures clarity but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of concepts (clean slate vendor, glass orchard) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals (e.g., "comma-seed" as a charged image). Transformation of tropes through grounded choices.</comment>
