<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The courtesan's motivation to "defy the lullaby of conformity" is clear and embodied in her precise, disciplined actions. Her chastity is framed as an active, chosen power ("a chosen emptiness"), and her micro-choices under pressure reveal a clear hierarchy of values. A slight deduction for interiority that, while vivid, occasionally verges on abstract summary rather than pure embodied sensation in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the city "inhaled differently," reconfiguring its social and psychological state. The cost is legible in the "trembled like a plucked string" serenity and the guards' paused pikes. The pattern of gathering and re-weaving echoes escalates cleanly to this decisive, felt change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in economical, pressure-driven detail. The courtyard, prism, and looms are not just described but actively constrain and enable every choice. The final image of the prism ringing "like a bell made of dew" is charged by this integration. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and wholly filtered through the POV's urgent, poetic perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a clean density increase and cadence shift—from solitary ritual to communal awakening. The dominant stake (freeing suppressed truth) is signaled early and tightens with the arrival of the patrol, forcing a quickened yet serene pace. The cost is the palpable risk of discovery and the energy expended to maintain poise under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of harvesting echoes to defy conformity. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the city "learning slowly how to refuse and still sing." Subtext is rich in the juxtaposition of bodily discipline against vocal liberation, and the lullaby/counterchant motif avoids moralizing, embracing complex ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, a "bodily poetic" perceptual signature that filters every image. The patterned, lyrical elision ("between sigh and smile") is taught early and pays off at closure. POV is stable and deeply internal, with syntax and rhythm perfectly reflecting the courtesan's disciplined yet transcendent state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly polished with superb rhythmic control. Minor deduction for a slight over-density of figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "breath rose like pale birds" alongside "threads no thicker than snowlight"), which, while beautiful, creates a minute drag on momentum. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffolds, or muddle; every sentence advances the narrative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of fantasy, ritual, and quiet rebellion. The core concept of a "harvest of echoes" is fresh and specific, driving the entire narrative logic. The choice of a "chaste courtesan" as the agent of vocal liberation is a non-obvious, transformative inversion of trope. The risk of a dense, poetic style pays off in coherence and stakes.</comment>
