<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Iria's characterization is precise and embodied, with consistent motivation rooted in rejecting false comfort. Her micro-choices under pressure—lighting lanterns, writing a charter—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The sailor applies relevant secondary pressure, and their collaboration feels earned. Minor deduction for slight summary in middle beats, but closure choice is motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong, with pattern breaks (lanterns, bell, bottle) reweighting stakes. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost felt in the bottle's ticking. Orientation is clear early. Slight ambiguity in causal linkage between invitation and sailor's arrival prevents a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated into action and choice—paper lanterns, amber bottle, and bell all constrain tactics and charge the finale. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "salt in her coat, ash under her fingernails"). The bottle functions as micro-setting, shaping the closure image decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Iria's agency under accumulative lens: conceiving plans, writing invitations, collaborating. Stakes tighten through density increases (charter, bell, cistern plans). Cost is legible in labor and the bottle's symbolic weight. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions (bottle as vessel for design, revival as rehearsal). Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., "future children arguing about prices"). No explicit thematic statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with poetic compression that serves the accumulative design. POV is stable, and perceptual signature is strong ("the bay carried only the sigh of spent miracles"). Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without artifice. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful ("abandoned lanterns bobbed like faded thoughts"). Rhythm varies naturally, and sentences advance story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy, community revival, and symbolic objects feels fresh and inevitable. The amber bottle is a non-obvious core element that transforms the premise. Risk-taking in lyrical prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universals.</comment>
