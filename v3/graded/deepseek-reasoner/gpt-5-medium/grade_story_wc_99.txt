<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and credible self-deception ("obedience is the way fear pretends to be careful"). The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the release of the words and the lace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear cost in the final image of the pocketed compass, a "small moon steadied." Orientation is immediate; the pattern of remembrance is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The islet setting actively pressures choice and supplies the key objects (compass, rock, lace). The environment constrains the action and charges the final image, with micro-settings (cove, driftwood) functioning as crucibles for the character's reckoning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, following the lace's instructions. The cost is legible in the "knots between my ribs" and the act of speaking the long-held apologies, a meaningful tightening that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of unspoken regret emerges entirely through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the compass steadied and the intention to "listen to branches," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and masterful rhythmic control are maintained under pressure ("the sea tongued the shore with rhythmically placid hunger"). Purposeful elision (the severance, the one who mattered) is taught and pays off, enriching the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exquisite prose with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, serving the Accumulative drive. The final paragraph's cadence shift is perfectly executed, supporting the closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of nautical and bonsai imagery feels organic and inevitable. The core concept of "tides of remembrance" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, avoiding template plots.</comment>
