<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Jae's motivation to prove sideways time is clear and drives the plot, with his internal conflict shown through his fear versus the biologists' concerns. His micro-choices, like pulling the lever, reveal his values under pressure. The final image of him "slightly turned" shows an earned, cost-bearing change. Minor deduction for slightly abstract emotional rendering in peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (mantas rescued) with a resonant reconfiguration (Jae's altered self) under a causal lens. The cost is legible in the surge and his changed return. Causality is tight, with each action leading to the next. The orientation is clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting constrains choice (the magnetic nexus forces the probe's use) and charges the final image (the ravine where mantas nest). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action. The station's design as a "harp for the wind" is both vivid and functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early (missing mantas), and escalation is driven by Jae's agency under the causal lens. The lever pull is a meaningful tightening that forces a trade-off (surge risk). Cost is visible in the dimming lights and his altered return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images (time moving sideways, proof as affection) without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in implication, like the mantas' eyes holding "a long light."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic yet precise perceptual signature. The voice modulates with pressure ("breath pulled sideways through ice"). No head-hopping or elision issues. Dialogue is absent but not required.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is cohesive and purposeful ("architecture of delayed reflections"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm supports scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The concept of sideways time is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in poetic style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination of elements is organic and transformative.</comment>
