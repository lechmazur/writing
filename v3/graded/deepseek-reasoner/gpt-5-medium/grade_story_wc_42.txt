<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to restructure the instrument stack and unlearn the Moon's silence is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the data's pulse against the noise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through density and cadence shifts. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the protagonist reconfigures his understanding of the chronometer and the Moon's voice, with cost felt in the final image of them daring to hope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The observatory setting and the tools within it are indispensable, constantly pressuring choices and charging the final image. The environment is rendered with vivid, purposeful sensory detail filtered through a professional POV, such as the telescope pedestal sighing with a century of scars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the landslide and instrument failure creating coherent pressure that forces stance crystallization. The cost is unmistakable in the smeared photon data and the director's silent, bedside vigil.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of listening. The final reconfiguration—unlearning the idea that the Moon owed them silence—arises from concrete particulars without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with a consistent, voice-motivated POV. The prose has a distinct texture in word choice and syntax, and any elision (e.g., the leaf) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptionally high information density and propulsion, though a minor risk of overwriting exists in a few densely figurative lines (e.g., "Light is a fleeing animal..."). No loops or scaffold; clarity and concision are maintained throughout, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of precision instrumentation and poetic listening feels inevitable. The risk-taking in voice and perspective heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, creating a singular artistic stance.</comment>
