<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, intensifying under pressure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, though contradictory impulses could be more simultaneous than summarized. The final endurance is earned, with a visible cost in the teacher's absence and the eerie nostalgia.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant Earned Stasis where the prophecy is hushed but the cost of the teacher's absence and the eerie nostalgia remain. Orientation is immediate and clear. The final image of the "absence I have made" lands with conceptual and felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The prism atrium and grotto are not merely described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the action, with the cold glass, forming dew, and taste of iron and sea all serving the central conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens, as each new line of prophecy demands a specific musical response. The cost is legible in the final "absence," and the persistent constraint of the listeners' hunger creates coherent, tightening pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as a protective garment emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the held-open sentence, reweighting the concept of a "vested hush" without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent, lyrical perceptual signature. The prose's rhythm and diction are masterfully controlled under pressure, and any elision (e.g., the teacher's fate) is purposeful and pays off in the final cost.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. Minor risk of figurative density in peak beats ("the sentence that tried to become a map fogs over") slightly obscures clarity but does not harm closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A highly original and specific synthesis of music, prophecy, and silence. The core concept of a "vested hush" is fully committed to and its implications are followed through with conceptual integrity, feeling both fresh and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
