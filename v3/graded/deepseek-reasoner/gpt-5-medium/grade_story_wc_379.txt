<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The curator's motivation ("I inventory stories before objects") is clear and drives the plot. Their internal conflict is shown through the micro-choice to use the locket's hairpin, a credible action under pressure. The final choice to open the mailbox is earned by the prior act of listening. The character's defining trait of "leading through following" is embodied, not just stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (the mailbox opens) with a resonant reconfiguration (the community is healed). The accumulative lens holds: pressure builds through layered stories until a cadence shift (the shared "metronome of ache") triggers the opening. The cost is legible in the shared vulnerability of the stories told. The orientation is clear within the first 100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The courtyard and mailbox function as a micro-setting that directly pressures the characters' choices and charges the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful ("sandal scuffs," "gritty and tender hush"). The mailbox is not a generic object; its specific, non-postal lock is a central constraint that shapes the entire narrative arc and climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in soliciting stories, a choice that deepens the communal stake. The pressure coheres and tightens under the accumulative lens as each confession ("clicked some unseen tumbler") intensifies the need for a resolution. The cost is the emotional weight of the shared vulnerabilities, made legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of healing through listening emerges organically from the specific events and the central conceit of the story-vault mailbox. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "we heal in the hearing." Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like the developer folding a letter into his vest, a silent, earned transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first-person POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent, lyrical perceptual signature ("a hush gritty and tender around our ankles"). The collective "we" voice is controlled and coherent. The prose's rhythm modulates beautifully with the emotional intensity, accelerating into the climactic "metronome of ache."</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythmic control and information density. A minor deduction for occasional dense figurative language that slightly obscures immediacy in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a spine relaxing under communal breath"). However, the language is largely purposeful and the closure image remains crystal clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core concept—a mailbox that opens only to the right chorus of stories—is a fresh, ingenious synthesis of magic realism and community narrative. It feels inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its premise, and the specific, lived details of the courtyard and its residents anchor its universality without abstraction.</comment>
