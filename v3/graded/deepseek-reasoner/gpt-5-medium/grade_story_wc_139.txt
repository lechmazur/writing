<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a clear hierarchy of values. The narrator's motivation ("the mathematics of a fair trade") is dramatized through action and ethically complex. The final endurance feels earned, though the final line's epiphany ("the new vowel of fairness") edges toward summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Inferred Hybrid lens (Causal/Accumulative) holds. Closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing via the final ink pot image, reweighting the father's legacy with a new, honest cost. Causality is tight; the breach and escape sequence is a masterful because/therefore linkage. The felt cost is legible in the final act of cleaning the warmth away.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The prep room is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and supplies key resources (the cart, the alarm reset). The vintage ink pot is a recurring object that decisively constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the POV's professional expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Hybrid lens, with the director's habitual inattention ("he leaves the bolt hanging") providing the causal breach. The cost is unmistakable in the physical risk and the emotional price of the trade. The dominant stake (asylum as fair trade) tightens meaningfully through the sequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of ethical inheritance and fair exchange emerges organically from events and images (ink pot, ledger, washing). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image. A slight deduction for the final line's explicit articulation ("the new vowel of fairness"), which trends toward statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a controlled, precise perceptual signature. The voice's lyrical density is consistently voice-motivated and pattern-taught. Elision (e.g., the sponsors' exact words) is purposeful and pays off. Minor register elevation in peak beats ("deathly vitality") is justified by the POV's professional lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density. Rhythm is expertly controlled, modulating with scene needs. A minor artifacting deduction for a near-paraphrase loop: "waiting actively" / "Waiting actively is like polishing a mirror." Figurative language is coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A highly original, non-obvious synthesis of the funeral home setting, political asylum, and con artist legacy. The core concept is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded choices. The vintage ink pot as a tool of both forgery and witness is a singular, irreplaceable inflection.</comment>
