<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with prosopagnosia shaping perception and method. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final renunciation (painting the possibility of empathy) is earned by prior causality with visible cost. The trait drives inevitable mistakes that compound, balancing competence with genuine struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through pattern and cadence shifts toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The final image of the painting and the letter reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, and the closure lands with a felt price: "leaving only mist."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The quarry functions as a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through the POV's professional bias. The recurring ribbon fragment and phone case constrain discovery and reconfigure meaning, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the act of lancing the silt and the discovery of the blue ribbon serving as a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge. The cost is legible in the final conceptual repricing of the case, though the pressure is more accumulative than causally tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of empathy through unification of opposites emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. The final letter from the dancer provides a profound, earned reconfiguration of the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are exceptional, with a voice perfectly calibrated to the POV's condition. Purposeful compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure. POV is stable and apt, with diction and syntax consistently reflecting the methodical, tracing mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical with high information density, though some figurative language in high-pressure beats ("grief also rises when pierced") approaches a slight overload without harming clarity. Rhythm is masterfully controlled, and there are no loops, scaffold, or muddle in the crucial closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a face-blind portrait artist investigating a cold case is a singular, non-obvious premise executed with full conceptual integrity. The specific, grounded choice of prosopagnosia transforms the familiar trope, creating a fresh angle that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
