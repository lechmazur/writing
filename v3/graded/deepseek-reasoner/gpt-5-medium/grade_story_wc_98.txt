<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV character's "empirically whimsical" methods are embodied through concrete actions like cataloging waves and asking crabs to cite sources. Interiority is specific and contradictory, balancing doubt with "careful courage." Final choice to plant the seed is earned by prior causality and Iru's arrival, with visible cost in the monsoon's approach.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure escalates through sensory density (petal debates, pollen archivists) and the monsoon's imminent arrival. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the seed's sprouting reconfigures the island's memory with cost felt in the "patient fist of water" waiting. Orientation is clear by line 4.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the ridge's flowers and monsoon directly pressure choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through POV (petals "debate like cautious jurors"). The "hollow shaped like a sleeping ear" constrains the planting decision, making the setting active, not decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes (protecting cultural memory from monsoon's erasure) escalate through accumulative density—dreams, child's conch, seed's pulse—forcing the planting choice. Agency is clear: protagonist's decision to plant forecloses other paths with cost (monsoon's arrival). Coincidence (Iru's appearance) complicates but doesn't resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme (memory vs. erasure) emerges through specific images (seed recalling rain, conch echoing sentences) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the tree's leaf showing "village roofs intact again and self-correcting." Subtext operates in implication, e.g., "water forgets our shapes while remembering our salt."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: "empirically whimsical" diction blends scientific rigor with mythic wonder. POV is stable, with perceptual signature ("petals debate like cautious jurors"). Purposeful compression (e.g., "when every footprint becomes a rumor") is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and vivid metaphors ("a bruise of approaching rain"). Minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "luminous doubt made space for careful courage") slightly slows momentum but doesn't obscure closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mythic and empirical modes feels fresh and inevitable. Core premise (reality checker in a fantasy island) is transformed through specific details (tidebook, pelican verification). Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. No derivative echoes.</comment>
