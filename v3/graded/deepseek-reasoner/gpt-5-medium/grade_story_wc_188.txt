<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and embodied in micro-choices; Lark's introduction is effective but her characterization remains slightly thin, lacking the same depth of contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost in the final image of gravity "loosened, not vanquished, but persuaded." The mosaic note provides a coherent, taught pattern that pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, actively constraining and enabling choices. The fortress walls, tools, and flowers function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens, through the deliberate preparation and execution of the display. Cost is legible in the altered gravity and the keeper standing straighter, a meaningful deepening that reweights the stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of "serious playfulness" emerges organically from events and images, resisting moralizing. The final image of blooms drinking ash offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are exceptional. Voice is consistent and purposefully compressed; elision is taught and paid off. Dialogue for the single exchange with Lark is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly controlled, though a few metaphors verge on over-stacked (e.g., "velvet heavy with water"). Rhythm is exquisite and supports momentum. Minor figurative density prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of concepts feels inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail.</comment>
