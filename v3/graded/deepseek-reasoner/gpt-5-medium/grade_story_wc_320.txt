<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a clear hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—leaving the hush and star fragment behind—is earned by prior causality and carries a visible cost of letting go, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the final image of the gorge as an orchestra pit reweighting all prior material. The cost is legible on the page in the act of release, and the lens holds without contradiction from the taught pattern of signals and echoes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The radio tower city is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The environment is a tactile, lived-in pressure system, with specific details like "ladders broken" and "cables knitting shadows" woven through action and perception, fulfilling the 9+ test with exceptional integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a decisive tightening at the climax: pressing the hush to the wound. The cost is unmistakable in the act of letting the signals go, forcing a trade-off that forecloses a path and honors the story's dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of finding beginnings in endings emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, offering profound ambiguity through the engineer's note and the city's laughter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature and purposeful elision that pays off at closure. The prose reflects the interpreter's mind, blending technical and mystical lexicon without register drift, though minor density in peak beats prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density, but suffers a slight figurative overload in high-pressure beats (e.g., "moon lowered the needle of gravity"). This minor artifact prevents a 9+ score, though clarity and momentum are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial signals, Hollywood fragments, and engineered silence feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, transforming familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and world.</comment>
