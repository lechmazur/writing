<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in a complex, contradictory love for Miren and the library. The final choice to rebuild as a "lending of breath" is earned by prior causality, though the volcanic tenderness metaphor occasionally risks abstraction in peak emotional beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through patterns of artistic clues to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with undeniable cost—the seeds writing the last names onto the wind—and the final image reconfigures the meaning of the initial arson as a necessary primer.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The archive is a masterclass in micro-setting, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, from "feathers from burned atlases" to "seams between the stones," fully integrated into the protagonist's goal-directed action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in deciphering clues, under the accumulative lens. A single, meaningful deepening occurs with the discovery of the burned names, reweighting the stake from a personal promise to a communal vow with clear, legible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the reconciliation of destruction and preservation, arson and love. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"a sentence that portrayed the city not as a ruin but as a vow kept"—without moralizing, reweighting all prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and controlled, rhythmic prose under pressure. The voice—"analytically intuitive," "heart steaming with volcanic tenderness"—is consistent and character-specific, with purposeful elision (e.g., the council's demand) that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. Minor figurative strain in "volcanic tenderness" and a potential paraphrase loop in "keep the books safe by keeping the readers safer still" slightly dull momentum, but clarity is maintained at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of arson, archives, and memory preservation. The core concept—using fire to save rather than destroy—is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, feeling inevitable in hindsight and heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
