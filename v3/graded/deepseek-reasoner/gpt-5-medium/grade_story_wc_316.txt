<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Neri and Rae are sharply defined through complementary traits ("Neri soft where Rae was sharp"), and the narrator's emotional numbness provides a clear, embodied motivation. Their final choice to grant joint custody is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values, though Rae's backstory ("whose laugh had once broken a tyrant") feels slightly underexplored for its weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through patterned training and the jar's hum until the final test reconfigures the custody premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost: "I felt the frost inside me drain." The disorientation of the floating dojo is functional and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating dojo is vividly sensory ("clouds pass under the sparring floor") and constrains the final test on the "umber tiles." However, its physical rules remain slightly abstract, and the "statues rearranging themselves" feels more thematic than tactically limiting, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start (custody of the brain), and pressure escalates cleanly through the training montage to the final, decisive test. The cost is legible in the narrator's thawing numbness and the jar's "subtle consent," though the petitioners' personal stakes could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central concept, with "complementary opposites" moving from a training method to a profound philosophical answer to emotional numbness. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal resolution: "the pattern required the alternating current." No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a poetic, perceptual signature ("slow rivers of breath," "key fits a wound"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through the narrator's consciousness. The experimental, compressed style is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and varied rhythm. A minor deduction for slight over-density in peaks (e.g., "complementary opposites held and released" risks abstraction) and a single paraphrase loop ("life to life"). Overall, propulsion and clarity remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a clone custody battle within a mystical dojo is fresh and non-obvious. The core concept is fully committed to and transformed by the specific, grounded choice to resolve it through sparring and complementary opposites, making it feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
