<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied through concrete actions ("held those fears in the same two careful hands") and micro-choices under pressure. Her gentle persistence is not a label but a tactical stance that compels higher-stakes choices, like facing the patrol. The final renunciation (not ringing the bell after the raid) is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the bell is rehung "where the wind could ring thanks," reconfiguring community meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. The patrol confrontation is a meaningful tightening that narrows options, forcing adapted tactics. Orientation is clear by line 3.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor and silver bell function as micro-settings that constrain choice (patrol search) and charge the final image. Sensory details are purposefully selective ("amplified quiet," "frost prints") and filtered through communal urgency. The environment evolves causally with events, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens—Mara's declaration and the patrol raid are pressure points that deepen stakes and force adaptation ("we sharpened our timing"). Cost is legible in the tightened operations and the bell's silent holding. The dominant stake (community survival) is narrowed through coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions (bell as "bridge rung into air"), resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to scarcity and care through the polished bell reflecting communal faces. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures and silence, particularly during the patrol confrontation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends lyric compression ("a braid strong enough to lift a season") and concrete urgency. Purposeful elision (e.g., unnamed donors) is taught early and pays off. Diction remains within the communal lexicon, even under peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without artifacts. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("like a rust-red rib cage"). Sentences advance multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, plot) with concision. No loops, scaffold, or register drift even in climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of anonymous donations, intergenerational exchange, and a symbolic bell feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific, verifiable detail ("chaff sacks for the goats") avoids quirkiness, grounding the premise in lived experience.</comment>
