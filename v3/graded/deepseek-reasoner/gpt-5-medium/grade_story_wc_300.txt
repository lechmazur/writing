<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vivid through the inspector's professional duty versus deeper empathy, embodied in micro-choices like switching off sensors and hesitating at the door. The final choice to crown the spire is earned by prior causality ("I had been carrying a harder assignment inside my ribs") and carries visible cost in the rejected stamp and rewritten door. Emotional specificity avoids diagnostic labels, grounding transformation in concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory density and emotional weight until the hesitation moment opens a decisive reconfiguration. Closure is a resonant Charged Poise where the inspector's vow reconfigures the bunker's purpose, with cost legible in "I signed with silence" and the air shifting "like tears finally permitted." The final image of "a door made of faces" reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The crystal cave is no mere backdrop; its resonant hush and quartz spire actively constrain choice, forcing sensory attention and providing the literal platform for the climax. Sensory detail is purposefully selective ("Walls of quartz rose like frozen rain") and evolves with the action, charging the final image. The seashell and pearl function as micro-settings that pressure and enable the inspector's pivotal decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by accumulative pressure—the weight of confessions and the pearl's "small responsibility"—culminating in the inspector's agential choice to crown the spire, which forecloses the path of isolation with a felt cost ("survival approved, hearts separated" is rejected). The dominant stake (safety vs. connection) tightens meaningfully through this single decisive intensification under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of institutional duty and human connection, resolved through the non-literal image of shared light mending isolation. The final reconfiguration offers a resonant answer without moralizing, as the inspector's bow acknowledges a mistaken "safety for solitude." Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like the spire offering "a finger held to lips."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized through a distinct perceptual signature ("the air held a resonant hush") and rhythmic control that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression ("I became a conduit") serves the accumulative design. The single character's voice remains coherent and specific, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and vivid metaphors ("bending light into a patient lace of ghost rivers") that advance character and atmosphere. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "time decelerated into the heartbeat of a hesitation") slightly slows momentum but does not obscure cause-effect. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic inspection and emotional archaeology, transforming the bunker trope through specific, lived detail like the lullabies in peaches. The core concept of "latent radiance" is made indispensable through the pearl's function. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
