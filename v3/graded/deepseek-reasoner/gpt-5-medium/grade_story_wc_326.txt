<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in the porcelain shard and heartbeat counting. The motivation to "fetch wisdom from failure" is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling the recalibration choice. A minor deduction for the slightly abstract phrasing "wisdom arrives in thin slices that cut," which borders on diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, landing with undeniable cost as the protagonist chooses to let the signal fade and carry the shard as a lens. The lens holds; the pattern of spilled ink and radio static coheres into a decisive cadence shift that reweights the stake. The final image of "a wiser kind of dark" makes the cost legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The observatory setting and porcelain shard are micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the POV's professional and emotional priorities. The shard's use to scrape frost and refract light is a tactile, lived-in action that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, through the act of reading the ink patterns and recalibrating the array. The cost is legible in the pulse's staccato and the ghost's accusation. A single meaningful tightening—the revelation of the misread sequence—forecloses the option of mere argument and forces corrective action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of seeking wisdom from failure emerges organically from events and images, notably the shard and the ink. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "a wiser kind of dark," reweighting prior material without moralizing. The ghost's statement, "you merely believed yourself big enough to," deepens the thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are exceptional, with a consistent, voice-motivated use of compression and elision ("the hour tastes of midnight solace"). The digital ghost's dialogue carries a distinct, clipped quality compared to the protagonist's richer interiority. The pattern of figurative language is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propelled, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and pattern-taught, serving character and atmosphere. Sentence-level rhythm accelerates and breathes with scene needs, such as the staccato pulse mirroring the protagonist's stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a digital ghost, porcelain shard, and ink-divination method feels fresh and organic, not a checklist. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
