<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The gardener's interiority is concrete and embodied ("palm nicked by a burr of wire"), and his blithe yet tenderly organized nature drives his methodical, patient investigation. His final choice to honor both the lie and the truth is earned by his prior characterization and the cost of his discovery. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic feel in "feels his blithe mask soften into respect," which briefly abstracts an internal shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with pressure building through the density of sensory and symbolic patterns. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the gardener reconfigures the empty grave's meaning, with cost legible in his act of planting poppies to "honor both the living and the departure." The linkage from decoding to discovery is coherent and the final image reweights all prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt silo, tapestry, and sovereign case are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The environment is a crucial participant, with the silo's "listening metal" and the tapestry's border providing the literal map for the gardener's quest. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and deeply integrated with the POV's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the gardener's agency under the Accumulative lens, as his decoding of the tapestry's pattern systematically narrows his options and leads to the discovery. The cost is felt in the physical act of excavation and the emotional weight of the revealed truth. A slight deduction as the initial clock timeframe, while beautifully set, does not actively tighten tactics throughout the middle beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the widow's woven lie and the gardener's decoding, exploring the complex overlap of deeds and love, appearance and truth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the poppy ring, honoring duality without moralizing. The tapestry's "border's grammar" becomes a powerful metaphor for reading intention and hidden history.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a consistent lyrical, almost elegiac rhythm that modulates with the emotional pressure ("velvet unwinding from a well-kept secret"). The POV is stable and deeply filtered through the gardener's perception. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly polished with strong rhythmic control and virtually no line-level artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though its high density risks slight opacity in a few phrases ("uncharted echoes drift down like migrating birds"). Information density is very high, with nearly every sentence advancing multiple layers of story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cemetery gardener, a decoding tapestry, and a silo full of echoes is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, avoiding cliché. The risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
