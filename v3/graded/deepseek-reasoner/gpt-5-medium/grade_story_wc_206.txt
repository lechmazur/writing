<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's "wilts near dishonesty" trait is embodied in key beats (knees folding at lie, strength returning at truth), driving micro-choices that escalate stakes. Final shadow sacrifice feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost ("lighter by a shade") scaling to length. Interiority remains concrete and character-particular ("my bones softening like wax"), avoiding diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through density of imagery and symbolic exchanges (truth for strength, shadow for light). Closure is Charged Poise—shadow's nod and new role reconfigures city's relationship with attention, cost legible in protagonist's lightness. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) clear by line 4, pattern taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Resonance chamber constrains choice (requires honesty/offering) and charges final image (rust becoming patina, light as "borrowed instrument"). Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("air hummed with hushed overtones", "hush that tasted like tin and pears"), filtered through professional bias. Micro-setting (tuning box) functions as tool that enables climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency under Accumulative lens: truth-confession to rust covenant, shadow sacrifice. Cost is unmistakable ("let my shadow step away"). Stakes shift from reclaiming light to tethering it to listening, narrowing options meaningfully. Coincidence absent; all turns arise from character choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: honesty, attention, and repair as sacred acts. Final image (shadow laboring above, light as "borrowed instrument") offers non-literal answer to central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in symbolic exchanges (shadow for listening, rust for patina). Complexity embraced through cost-bearing transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("melodies that bruise like fruit", "time itself were in the balance") with rhythmic control under pressure. POV stable; elision (e.g., exact nature of "midnight") taught and paid off in closure. Diction consistently within character's lexicon—lyrical but grounded in repairman's worldview.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High information density without loops or scaffold. Figurative language purposeful and coherent ("rust bloomed not as decay but as patina"). Syntax varies naturally with scene needs—compressed during tension ("moment taut as a spring"), expansive during resolution. No artifacts obscuring closure; final line resonates.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of familiar concepts (light theft, symbolic bargaining) through specific lived detail (music box repair, philosopher's stone chip). Risk-taking in lyric-prose hybrid heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise transformed by grounding in character trait ("wilts near dishonesty") and occupational logic.</comment>
