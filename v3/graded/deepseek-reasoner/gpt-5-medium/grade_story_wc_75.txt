<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV's internal conflict ("embalmer rather than nurse") is concrete and embodied. Micro-choices (baking bread, testing the lens) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final acceptance of the lens feels earned by prior causality, though the closure choice is slightly abrupt, costing a hairline deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost ("nectar armor, sweet and unbearable"). The late revelation of the lens's true function is a meaningful tightening that reweights stakes. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is immersive and constrains choice (cistern ovens, snail-shell vents). The grotto and waterfall pressure tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("scent of beeswax, damp limestone, and something like rosewater dread").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: testing the lens's power and carrying names into the spray. Cost is legible in the curator's burden of responsibility. One meaningful deepening (lens revelation) sufficiently tightens options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through motifs (bread, lens, wax) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: history becomes "eaten, and therefore enduring." Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with lyrical, precise prose ("rosewater dread"). POV is stable and voice-consistent. Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Minor scaffold in one beat ("I wrote histories while feeding them, and they fed me stories") costs a slight deduction, but no artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of elements (museum guide, opera lens, bread baking) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail.</comment>
