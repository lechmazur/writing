<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in the tidal-pool chronicler's specific perception. The final choice to go inland is earned by the prior causality of the pause and the cicada's metaphor. The second character's presence is felt but could be more dynamically pressurized; their silence is potent but their agency is slightly passive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the pause itself becomes an arch "finally passable." Cost is legible in the foreseen futures of resentment or thawed fear. The grotto's "soft breath" of approval provides a subtle, felt cost of the choice made.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The grotto is indispensable, functioning as a micro-setting that pressures the choice through its dripping "slow metronome" and "sea glass light." The jade cicada, a recurring object, constrains the choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's accumulation of foresight during the pause, a textural deepening that reweights the dominant stake of the relationship. The cost is felt in the envisioned alternative futures, particularly the one where "comfort" is mistaken "for completion." A single, meaningful intensification is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transition emerges organically from the cicada's metaphor and the protagonist's method of "sidelong seeing." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: extending the coast inland rather than abandoning it. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence, particularly in the shared trust of the cicada's "stubborn glint."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature shaped by the narrator's profession. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity without becoming obscure. Purposeful compression and elision ("Each view arrived not head on, but sideways") are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with exceptional rhythm and control. Minor figurative strain appears in the peak beat ("foam tightened by wind, then collapsing into lace"), slightly obscuring immediacy but not causality. Otherwise, sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere with concision and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a tidal-pool chronicler's perspective with a relationship stakes is fresh and non-obvious. The jade cicada as a metaphor for molting and transition feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the dense, accumulative style heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, fully committing to its lyrical premise.</comment>
