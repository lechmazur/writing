<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mara's interior contradiction between controlling and listening is embodied in micro-choices like untying knots and stepping aside. Her final renunciation of control is earned through prior causality with visible cost ("she signed by stepping aside"). Emotional progression feels organic, avoiding diagnostic speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Mara's vow to "reconstruct only what grows kinder" reconfigures her stance with undeniable cost. Orientation is immediate; causality flows through pattern breaks like the jasmine braiding itself.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is fully integrated and constrains choices—the mossy trellis, linden leaf, and storm season actively pressure Mara's decisions. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional perspective. The final image of the leaf pressed to the post charges the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Mara's agency, with pressure cohering through density increases (e.g., plants "working out their own calculus"). Cost is legible in her ledger of "what she had not forced." One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars—the linden leaf, the braided jasmine—avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of control vs. listening. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like the boy nodding "like a sapling."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Mara's expertise ("hear roots thinking"). Diction remains within her lexicon, and rhythmic control is exceptional under pressure. Purposeful compression (e.g., "reluctant metamorphosis") is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains clarity and momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though slight overwriting risks in peaks ("droplets clung like second thoughts"). No loops or scaffold artifacts; sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines through the fresh synthesis of botanical observation and human transformation. The core premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific, verifiable detail avoids quirkiness.</comment>
