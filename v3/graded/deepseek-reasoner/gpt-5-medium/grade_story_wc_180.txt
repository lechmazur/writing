<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quartz-eye mender's internal conflict is concretely embodied through the unopened tin and his "bad with goodbyes" trait. His final choice to wait for his daughter to "open her own time" is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Mira applies immediate, character-specific pressure that reveals his values under stress without diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the decaying orchard is healed through ritual. Cost is legible in the image of "vows letting go the way grief sometimes does." Orientation is clear by ~100 words with the cathedral orchard and breach of contract established.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cathedral orchard is indispensable, constraining choices (pruning decisions) and charging the final image ("the cathedral learned to breathe on purpose"). Sensory detail is purposefully selective ("peaches and pears and a small ache of neglect") and integrated into action. The setting evolves causally with the ritual's success.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens—the ritual is his choice, and its execution deepens the stake of generational healing. Cost is unmistakable in the "readable rustle" of falling vows and the father's endurance of waiting. One meaningful tightening (the ritual) forecloses the path of stagnation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical renewal and generational wisdom emerges organically from the deciduous vows concept and the hair ribbon graft. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of shared "stubborn curve in their roots." No moralizing; subtext operates powerfully in gestures like closing the fist over the ribbon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control ("like a dropped marble rolling"). POV is stable and deeply embodied. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Mira's questions about balance). Purposeful compression ("using forgotten bag contents") is taught early and pays off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density with figurative language that consistently clarifies ("branches arched like ribs"). Syntax accelerates and breathes with scene needs. No register drift or mixed metaphors. Final paragraph's cadence shift ("crisp as pages") supports closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of organic decay and spiritual renewal within a sacred space. The deciduous vows concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and ritual. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without gimmickry. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
