<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. The final choice to stay and maintain the space is earned by prior causality, with the cost of unpaid labor and personal investment felt on the page. The janitor's arrival provides a crucible relationship that crystallizes the protagonist's commitment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with closure achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The terminal's transformation is a decisive change built through layered patterns of imagery and action. Cost is legible in the final image of the protagonist sleeping on a bench, having foregone personal comfort for the building's resurrection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining choices and charging the final image. The terminal functions as a micro-setting that dictates tactics, from rerouting water to flipping breakers. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the engineer's professional POV, making the space a lived-in, tactile character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with pressure cohering through the building's responsiveness to interventions. The cost is unmistakable in the physical labor and the shift from individual to communal purpose. The janitor's arrival introduces a complicating pressure that deepens the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of engineering precision and poetic wonder. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of hope, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The concept of "hope as a system" is tested and proven through maintenance, not declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with a consistent POV that filters the world through an engineer's lens. The voice modulates between technical precision and lyrical wonder without register drift. Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful, enhancing clarity rather than obscuring it. Syntax and rhythm accelerate and breathe in step with scene needs, particularly in the climactic description of the terminal breathing "like a rehabilitated lung."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of engineering and lyricism that feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of a civil engineer and an abandoned spaceport is organic and transforms familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
