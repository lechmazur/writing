<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Face blindness is not merely stated but actively shapes perception ("see by edges and weights, not faces") and informs the artistic approach to painting "shoulders of clouds." The desire to "mirror the sky inside walls" is a concrete, dramatized motive that compels the high-stakes choice to stay and paint. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with the cost of the impending demolition felt throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with pressure escalating through the density of sensory details and the live clock of the demolition. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the mural endures the blast, reconfiguring the space's meaning. The cost is legible in the final image: "the dawn still glows on the bark, quiet as a pulse, bright as a promise." The coin's discovery and use are tightly linked to the setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is the story's crucible, constraining the search and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("dust jumps," "motes," "greened by time"). The environment is fully integrated into action and thought, with the growth rings directly enabling the climax. The setting's evolution is causal, from the initial hush to the final implosion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the dual pressures of the hidden atlas and the foreman's countdown, a coherent intensification under the Accumulative lens. The protagonist's agency is clear in the search, the coin rubbing, and the deliberate choice to paint. The cost is the risk of being caught in the implosion, made visceral in the final moments. A single meaningful tightening is sufficient and powerfully executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of discovering and working within limits emerges organically from the action and the guild master's letter. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the sky survives the fall because the artist learned both their own and the room's limits. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image, such as the coin "remembering weather." The piece avoids moralizing, achieving its effect through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is exceptionally distinct, with a poetic, measured rhythm that mirrors the "heightened stillness." The perceptual signature is unique and consistent ("the way shoulders confess more than eyes"). Purposeful compression ("Layer by layer the bowl of sky deepens") increases density without sacrificing clarity. The voice modulates under pressure but never loses its characteristic texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is masterful, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is precise and pattern-taught ("like a held breath," "like cooled rain on stone"). Syntax and rhythm are expertly controlled to accelerate and breathe with the scene's needs. The read-aloud test would reveal a natural, varied cadence that supports the story's tension and release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a condemned building, a tree library, a face-blind artist, and a sky-painting pigment is highly original and feels organic, not checklist-driven. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The risk-taking—a quiet, accumulative plot in a high-tension scenario—heightens stakes and coheres perfectly. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
