<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with a clear, intensifying motivation to exchange certainty for curiosity. The final stance crystallization—fear that perfect restoration erases living hands—is earned by prior causality and resolved with a visible cost (letting underdrawings retain their whisper). A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward diagnostic self-awareness in the peak beat ("admitted fear").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held flawlessly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of the awakened mural and the protagonist's "lighter step" reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. The persistent constraint of the garden's echoes shapes tactics and the final image. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is not merely described but is the essential mechanism that constrains choice and charges the final image. The environment is fully integrated into action and perception, with sensory detail that is vivid, selective, and purposeful. The recurring object (hobo nickel) also functions as a micro-setting, actively shaping the protagonist's choices and tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is a decisive intensification through the dialogue with the wall, which reweights the dominant stake (certainty vs. curiosity) with a clear, felt cost. The protagonist's agency drives the deepening, moving from a simple restoration to a profound exchange that alters the final outcome. Pressure remains coherent and grows until the final act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically from events and images, resisting tidy morals and offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The final image of the "map keeps unfolding" reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates powerfully in the implied exchange between the restorer and the wall's consciousness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control that modulates with emotional intensity. The voice is consistently lyrical and precise, fitting the protagonist's profession and sensibility. Purposeful elision (the exact nature of the voice) is taught and paid off at closure, enhancing the mystery without sacrificing legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and controlled, with high information density and clear propulsion. There is a minor instance of potential overwriting in the phrase "pigments trembled into awareness where my solvent had barely grazed them," which slightly strains the metaphor. However, rhythm and syntax are masterfully varied, and no loops or scaffolding artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise—a restorer communicating with a mural through sound in a parabolic garden—is strikingly original and executed with full conceptual integrity. The combination of elements feels organic and inevitable, not a checklist. The story commits to its singular artistic stance, and the risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. A specific, non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
