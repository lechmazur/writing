<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse keeper's interiority is concrete and particular, with his "softly persistent" nature compelling his investigation. His final choice to answer the signal is earned by prior causality, with the cost of accepting his role as witness for the sea's dead made legible. The memory of the girl arises from a concrete cue and alters his present tactics, satisfying the BRR policy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural drive lens is taught early and holds, with closure achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The final image of holding the light "like a promise" reconfigures the keeper's role with undeniable conceptual cost. The orientation is immediate, and the pattern of gaps and observation pays off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The opal dock and the notch in the piling function as micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through the keeper's professional POV. The environment is fully integrated into the action, with the dock itself becoming a crucial actor in the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a clean cadence shift from observation to action. The dominant stake (decoding the gesture) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the keeper aligns the flower and chooses to send the signal. The cost of this agency is legible in the final, quiet act of sweeping the dock to hide the notch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges impeccably from events and images—witness, isolation, the sea's ledger—without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of meaning in final gestures. The final image reweights the prior material, transforming the keeper's eccentricity into a solemn duty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control that modulates beautifully with emotional intensity. The prose is character, its syntax and diction reflecting a patient, observant mind. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptional, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent, voice-motivated, and serves the atmosphere without muddle. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing in perfect step with the scene's needs. The final line is a model of resonant closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a nautical mystery with a lyrical, accumulative structure feels fresh and organic. The core concept of "borrowed memories" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. The story commits fully to its singular artistic stance, resulting in a memorable and authentic vision.</comment>
