<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV character's euthanasia tourist motivation is embodied through specific micro-choices (trawling, tapping ice) and contradicted by emerging care for others. The final endurance—delaying the clinic appointment—is earned through prior causality with visible cost (the child rescue, Erland's influence). Minor deduction for slightly telling backstory summary ("I used to measure forward").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: closure is Earned Stasis (refusing the clinic appointment) charged by the final image of "the sound of endings arriving and passing." Cost is legible in the delayed appointment and the parasol tip salute. Orientation is clear by line 4; pattern of listening and rescue tightens toward the storm veering aside.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina actively constrains choices (ice testing, rope use, storm response) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("water answers in old vowels"). The parasol tip functions as micro-setting, altering tactics and reweighting meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens: density increases through the child rescue and storm, forcing stance crystallization. Agency shifts from passive "tourist" to active listener and volunteer. Cost is visible in the delayed appointment and the physical risk taken during the rescue. One meaningful tightening (storm) suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images (parasol tip, rope, whistle) and actions (listening, delaying). The ending offers a non-literal answer—"living is just refusing an ending"—that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in Erland's dialogue and the gull-whistle's quiet promise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with lyrical compression ("wind braided our silence into patience"). POV is stable and voice-motivated; Elision taught early pays off at closure. Dialogue with Erland carries subtext and distinct idiom. Minor scaffold in one reflective block ("Patience used to be a queue...").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional density and rhythmic control; sentences advance multiple layers. Figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent ("marina is a page forwarded by wind"). No loops or artifacts; closure image shines. One minor paraphrase loop ("listening" slightly over-repeated) prevents perfection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of euthanasia tourism with disaster relief on ice. Premise transforms through specific detail (parasol tip, rope memory). Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight; closure image is singular and charged.</comment>
