<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interior contradiction is vividly embodied in "staying while leaving," and the final reconciliation is earned through specific on-page choices with visible cost. The protagonist's flawed empathy drives inevitable mistakes, and the micro-choice to remain seated during the confrontation reveals a hierarchy of values. Emotional progression feels authentic, layering shame, fear, and eventual clarity without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final hand-steadying image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pattern breaks (library's warmth, paired books) deepening stakes. Orientation is immediate; causality is tight through the invitation's geography of shame and the husband's mirrored invitation. The persistent constraint of the mistake shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The library environment constrains choice by forcing confrontation and charges the final image through its paradoxical shelving system. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (dust like waiting thoughts, tea that holds steady). Spatial choreography is coherent, with the corridor and turns enhancing atmospheric pressure. The stationery shop breathes ink and glue, anchoring the setting in tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the library's design forcing a deepening that changes knowledge. Cost is legible in the stacked motives and the refusal to reconcile into old shapes. The dominant stake (emotional repair) tightens through the paired reading, narrowing options to honest reckoning. Coincidence is absent; all turns arise from character choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the nested paradox concept, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal answer to mistakes as rooms rather than verdicts. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture (the hand-steadying) and silence. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars like the unsent letters and the ledger entries. Complexity is embraced without false equivalence or moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("absence is my coat and attention my lantern") and rhythmic control under pressure are exceptional. POV is stable and apt, with free indirect style blending character and narration seamlessly. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot ("You may leave by the front door, and I promise you will stay where you need to"). Elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("enlarged tranquility" bookends the story). Syntax varies naturally to support rhythm and emphasis. Read-aloud rhythm is exquisite, with sentence openings varying and paragraph lengths creating visual rhythm. No artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The secret society library concept offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on emotional repair, transformed through specific grounded choices. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with risk-taking heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and human complexity avoid generic templates, particularly in the nuanced handling of betrayal and forgiveness. No derivative premise echoes.</comment>
