<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong embodied emotion ("soot learned to speak in my breathing"). A meaningful endurance is earned, accepting the cost of fading memory. The final choice to "read its texture" feels motivated by the established desire to understand time's nature, though the emotional progression from trapped to acceptance could be slightly more dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the protagonist accepts the cost of the present "fading." The garden's hyperbolic geometry teaches its pattern early and pays off, reconfiguring meaning. Cost is legible in the final image of "reverie that holds still," a palpable trade-off for understanding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is not merely described but actively constrains and enables choice, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("ants stitching sun to shade"). The environment is fully integrated into action and thought, mirroring internal states without overt symbolism. The halo fragment functions as a micro-setting, its properties directly shaping the protagonist's options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift and density increase, reweighting the dominant stake of understanding time. The protagonist's agency is demonstrated through the choice to put the shard to his tongue and follow the descending bridge, a renunciation that forecloses other paths with a visible cost—accepting the ephemeral nature of the present.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of grief and memory emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: acceptance of transience is the texture of time. The final image of the garden blooming into "quaking reverie that holds still" reweights prior material, synthesizing the conflict between stasis and change without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and exceptional rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistently poetic and precise, filtered through the designer's worldview. Purposeful elision (e.g., the garden's exact rules) is taught and paid off at closure. The single POV is stable and apt, with syntax and diction reflecting the protagonist's heightened emotional and perceptual state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly poetic with strong rhythm and varied syntax. There is a minor risk of overwriting in a few high-pressure beats ("the air thickens into pages I can turn by walking"), but the figurative language is coherent and serves the accumulative mode. No loops or scaffold. Information density is very high, with most sentences advancing multiple layers of story and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A highly original and ingenious synthesis of surreal garden magic, memory, and grief. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on processing loss. The combination feels organic and inevitable, not a checklist. Bold risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without obscuring clarity, fully committing to its singular artistic vision.</comment>
