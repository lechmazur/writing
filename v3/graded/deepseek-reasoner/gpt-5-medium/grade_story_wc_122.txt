<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her deafness and tactile relationship to music driving every choice. Her internal conflict—fear of numbness versus the need to feel—is dramatized through her actions with the needle and drum, culminating in an earned reconfiguration of her purpose. The final choice to carry the lesson forward is rooted in her prior causality and carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through sensory density and pattern breaks toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands with undeniable cost in the final image of Mara carrying the "hush" forward, a decisive change earned by the scene's progression. The taught pattern of silence and reversal pays off impeccably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cavern is not merely described but functions as a crucial pressure source and resource, constraining and enabling the central action. The broken needle and drum are micro-settings that charge the final image and directly shape Mara's choice. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and purposeful, filtered entirely through her professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with Mara's decision to use her backward recorder constituting a meaningful tightening that narrows options and forces the final, costly choice. The dominant stake (defeating numbness) is tested and reweighted through the pressure of the cavern's silence and the specific mechanics of their attempt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of listening backward to move forward emerges organically from the particular actions of the characters and the specific, charged images of the needle, drum, and hush. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing, reweighting the entire narrative through the final image of the "filament of hush" now functioning as a compass.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is exceptionally stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature shaped by Mara's deafness. The lyrical, compressed prose is entirely voice-motivated and pattern-taught, with its deviations (e.g., "a mirrored hush that multiplied inward") serving to heighten pressure and clarity rather than obscure it. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is remarkably dense and propulsive, with nearly every sentence advancing multiple layers of story, character, and atmosphere. Figurative language is coherent, purposeful, and consistently integrated. A single minor instance of potential register elevation ("enthral") is fully justified by voice and context, causing no muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a deaf protagonist, a broken phonograph needle, and backward-recorded songs is strikingly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of a "filament of hush" is transformed from a metaphor into a literal, plot-driving element. The story commits fully to its singular artistic stance without safety-hedging.</comment>
