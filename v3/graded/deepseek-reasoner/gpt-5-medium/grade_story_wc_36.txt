<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("its case groaning like dry bark"). The final choice to play the flute and accept penance is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, avoiding diagnostic self-awareness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost ("my penance and my profession"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern breaks (flute's return, driftwood method) reweighting stakes. A persistent constraint (failure's legacy) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Environment constrains choice (thunder-echo range pressures tactics) and charges the final image (seam knitting clean). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("canyon hush pressed like velvet"). The flute functions as micro-setting, evolving in use and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful cadence shift (flute's autonomous note finding the seam). Cost is legible on the page ("the markets paid in emptiness"). Pressure coheres through pattern density increase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to failure and redemption through the image of woven worlds holding their shapes. Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars (flute, driftwood, breach). Subtext operates powerfully in silence and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled rhythmic variation under pressure ("Avalanches here begin in whispers"). Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off. POV remains stable and apt throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion. Minor artifact: "Avalanchingly" as adverb creation slightly strains register, though pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold; figurative language coheres and serves closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of fantasy and psychological depth feels inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific, verifiable detail creates authenticity beyond template plots.</comment>
