<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; micro-choices like offering his travel-name reveal values with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding stock phrasing. The final endurance (staying as caretaker) is earned by prior causality and carries felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the protagonist's sacrifice reweights the canyon's meaning. Cost is legible on-page in the "ringing cavity" left by his name. Orientation is clear within 120 words; pattern-teaching (echo mechanics) pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (echo-tunnel narrows options) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through POV. The canyon's "bone towers" and echo mechanics shape tactics throughout, exceeding mere description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens: harnessing birds, building listeners, and offering his name each tighten pressure. Cost is unmistakable in the name sacrifice. Dominant stake (translating texture) deepens meaningfully through these actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images (diamond, echoes) and avoids moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to language death through "texture learned to sing." Minor slip: "language was dying from overuse" slightly states theme, but doesn't dominate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control; patterned elision (e.g., "grain, scar, and dust") is taught and paid off. POV is stable and voice-consistent. No dialogue, but internal voice is highly specific and coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional prose with zero artifacts; high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language ("wind stitched a grammar") is consistent and purposeful. Closure beat ("a moving concord") is clear and resonant without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of concepts (echoes as braille, birds as translators). Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
