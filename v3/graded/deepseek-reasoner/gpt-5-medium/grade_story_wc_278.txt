<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is deeply rooted in specific guilt ("a scream once, small and new") and embodied through tactile choices (inking maps, handling amber). Interior contradiction is vivid: "I pretend the stars I prick are maps forward, but I am here to hush the dissonance of old guilt." Final choice to tattoo herself is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("the line passing right through my old refusal").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the protagonist chooses to "stay and listen," reconfiguring her relationship to guilt through the final image of the map pointing inward. Cost is legible in "I am not forgiven, not yet." Slight ambiguity in whether the recorder's intervention is fully causal deducts slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The "laboratory of lost sounds" functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (using the recorder, cabinet, amber) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposefully selective ("meteor hush," "boards salvaged from antique furniture"). The amber object evolves across beats, ultimately flexing "as if choosing" to reinforce the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens occurs through density increase: the recorder's translation ("I am untethered") deepens the stake, forcing the protagonist to tattoo the glyph. Cost is visible in the line "passing right through my old refusal." Agency is clear in the final self-tattoo, though the recorder's role slightly complicates pure protagonist-driven pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and listening emerges through concrete images (amber, stars, letters) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "the map on my arm points inward." Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like the woman leaving the amber ("keep the past that keeps you still"). Emotional aftereffect lingers without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a consistent perceptual signature ("each star a dot quiet as meteor hush"). Voice modulates under pressure but maintains lyrical control. Purposeful elision (e.g., the nature of the "scream") is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with high information density ("a dusk that unspools like tape and splices itself again"). Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor artifact: "sleep me" might read as a stutter in translation, but it serves the eerie tone. No loops or scaffolding issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of tattoo artistry, guilt, and haunted technology feels inevitable. The constellation glyph and amber are highly specific and irreplaceable. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise is transformed through grounded, emotional particulars rather than template plotting.</comment>
