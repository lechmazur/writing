<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The painter's internal contradiction—nostalgic yet aloof, yearning for the sea's interior yet bound to the quay—is embodied in concrete micro-choices, most notably the decision to enter the cave and the final, wordless painting. The final choice to paint the harbor's breath is earned by the prior causality of the cracked mirror and the oasis vision, with the cost of leaving the painted chamber legible in the line "I want to stay, but keeping the promise means not living in the painting."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens is taught early and holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the protagonist's refusal to stay in the cave forecloses that path with the visible cost of separation from the "temporary eternity." The cost is legible in the final image of the cracked mirror reflecting "the split I chose." The wrong turn leading to the oasis is a meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is not a postcard but a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. The "slick alphabet on the stones" and the "mineral syllables" of the ceiling pressure the protagonist's movement, while the oasis's "natural mirror" and "pool" are essential to the climax, reconfiguring his understanding of time and promise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from reflection to action. The cost of his choice is unmistakable on the page: the trade-off between the "temporary eternity" of the cave and the fulfilled promise on the quay is felt in the line "I want to stay, but keeping the promise means not living in the painting."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of artistic authenticity versus safe replication emerges organically from the protagonist's journey and the recurring image of the painted shell. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final act of painting the harbor's breath, reweighting the initial vow without moralizing. The conceptual cost of choosing the real, moving world over a perfect, static copy is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature filtered through the painter's worldview ("salt ghosts of places," "tidal shards"). The controlled rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful elision (e.g., the nature of the "voice") is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design. A minor deduction for slight density in the oasis description ("temporary eternity, the moment that repeats..."), which momentarily slows the beat but does not harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a painter's psychological journey with a mythic, subterranean quest feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "temporary eternity" is a specific, non-obvious inflection that heightens stakes and is fully integrated into the narrative's logic and closure. The risk of a lyrical, voice-driven piece pays off.</comment>
