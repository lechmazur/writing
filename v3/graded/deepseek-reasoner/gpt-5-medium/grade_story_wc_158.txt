<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("indexing heartbeats, lost addresses") and micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. The final choice to consent to the treaty is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, with contradictory impulses of hesitation and "shyly unstoppable" tending acting simultaneously.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through density increase and a cadence shift at the Gardener's arrival. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost on the page ("I still wake often, but I rise gentler"), foreclosing the path of solitary vigilance. The persistent constraint of insomnia shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and supplies resources, constraining the protagonist's actions and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through a distinct POV bias ("walls holding echoes of ink and salt").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the act of humming lullabies creating a meaningful tightening that forces the Gardener's arrival. The cost is unmistakable on the page in the vow to stop "confusing sharpness with safety," a trade-off that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of converting pain, reweighting prior material without a stated moral. Theme emerges organically from events and images ("photosynthesize pain into beauty"), embracing complexity through the blossom armistice concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and exceptional rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful compression and patterned elision that are taught early and paid off. POV is stable and apt, with a consistent, voice-motivated use of non-standard grammar and punctuation that remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("their chlorophyll woven from losses") is pattern-taught and pays off, causing no clarity loss. Read-aloud rhythm is masterful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of insomnia, oceanic imagery, and metaphysical treaty feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, committing fully to its premise with conceptual integrity and authentic vision.</comment>
