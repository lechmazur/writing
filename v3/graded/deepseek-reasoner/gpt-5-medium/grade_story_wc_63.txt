<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, embodied in micro-choices like offering the rake handle. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, though some emotional states ("searing reverie") verge on abstract. The final choice to involve the fisherman is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the shared act of carving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of shared balance reweights prior material with cost. The pendulum's pause creates a decisive cadence shift that charges the ending. Orientation is immediate and purposeful; causality remains intact through pattern and image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The tidal obsidian ridge is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("black glass breathes with the moon"), filtered through POV. The setting evolves causally, with the ridge actively emerging to surface debts and alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring shared balance) is signaled early and escalates through a meaningful cadence shift during the pendulum's pause. Protagonist agency drives the escalation under the accumulative lens; cost is legible in the surfacing of "drowned monograms" and the shared carving act. Pressure coheres until the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of incremental absolution emerges organically through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the shared carving and the ridge's "slow knell." Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, resisting tidy morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature ("brass scarred by salt, heavy with everyone's minutes"). Diction remains within the POV's lexicon, though some phrases ("searing reverie") slightly strain voice consistency. Rhythm controls pressure effectively; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("plank of silence") slightly obscures clarity but does not harm closure. No loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion is excellent. Read-aloud test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis feels inevitable; the clock-winder's ethical dilemma is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise offers a fresh angle on precision versus humanity.</comment>
