<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The leeward tide prophet is a distinct, competent figure whose motivation to "turn obstacles into instruments" is clear and consistently drives action. Embodied micro-choices under pressure, like passing the mallet to Zaya, reveal a hierarchy of values. However, interior contradiction and emotional degradation under stress are less explored, limiting the character's depth in a high-stakes climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the final image of clouds rewriting letters into silence charges the entire narrative with cost. The lens holds perfectly, with pressure escalating through the accumulation of dubbed sounds and threats. The orientation is immediate and the taught pattern of turning threats into instruments pays off decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The floating orchard is not merely a vivid setting but the central constraint that dictates every tactical choice. The environment is fully integrated into action, from the driftwood circle to the fruit that answers with "winter lungs." Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the prophet's professional perception, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</comment></grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through a coherent density of threats (gale, net of knives) met by the protagonist's active dubbing and reconfiguration. Each new complication is met with agency that narrows options and incurs a cost of stamina and focus. The dominant stake of survival is felt throughout, culminating in a visible price paid in the exhausted, listening silence of the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of transformation through creative engagement emerges organically from the core concept of "sketched resonance." The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the storm's threat into a silent, rewritten letter. It avoids moralizing, instead achieving a profound conceptual repricing through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The POV exhibits a stunningly distinct perceptual signature, with a voice that seamlessly blends the prophetic, the musical, and the mechanical. Diction and syntax are consistently controlled and purposefully compressed, reflecting the prophet's world. The single line of dialogue ("So I unrolled the canvas deck...") functions as action, and the elision of other speech is a taught, purposeful choice that reinforces the solitary, focused nature of the work.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control that accelerates with the storm. A minor deduction for figurative overload in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "a D grown from pressure and distance") creates a slight muddle, but clarity is never truly lost. The closure image remains sharp and potent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise of a musical prophet safeguarding a floating orchard is brilliantly original and executed with full commitment. The synthesis of concepts—dubbing, resonance, fractal generation—feels organic and inevitable. The story takes bold risks with its lyrical, accumulative mode and its highly specific lexicon, which pay off by heightening stakes and coherence without becoming a gimmick.</comment>
