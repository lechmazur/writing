<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion ("every metaphor felt like a cracked teacup"). Internal conflict is shown through contradictory impulses, and the final choice to use the column is earned by prior causality with visible cost. Micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values, though minor diagnostic language ("I mistook spinning for direction") slightly tempers peak authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) through the final nocturne performance. Cost is legible on-page in the protagonist's risky column revelation. Orientation is anchored early; linkage through sensory and metaphorical density reweights stakes coherently without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (archive shelves, perfume bottle apparatus) and charges the final image (peach drawing, orchard scent). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("dust sang under my shoes"), filtered through POV. The micro-setting of the bottle and metronome functions as an environment that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (apology delivery) escalates through accumulative deepening via ghostly interaction, driven by protagonist agency. Cost is unmistakable in the column's use as leverage. Pressure coheres under the textural lens, with one meaningful tightening (foreman call) that narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles emerges through events and images (cracked teacup, broken metronome) without direct statement. Subtext operates in gesture (peach drawing) and implication. Ending offers a non-literal answer through the played nocturne, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control ("dust sang under my shoes"). POV is stable and voice-consistent; elision (ghostly communication method) is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; diction remains within character lexicon even under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies purposefully. Minor register elevation in "imperfect miracle" phrase is voice-motivated and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of gossip-column exorcist and supernatural apology feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyric-prose hybrid heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity in details (perfume bottle mechanics) avoids template plots; emotional truth anchors originality.</comment>
