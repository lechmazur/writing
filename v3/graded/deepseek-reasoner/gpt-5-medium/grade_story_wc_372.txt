<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's meticulous nature and duty-driven motivation intensify credibly under pressure, culminating in a vow that redefines their role. The final choice to "measure even absences" is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost through the library's exhale and storm's softening. Embodied emotion remains specific and contradictory, avoiding diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, with pattern breaks (fractured pledge, second slide) deepening stakes toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands as a charged poise—the protagonist becomes "another entry, but also the keeper"—with cost legible in the library's exhale and the mentor's refractive presence. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen library constrains choice (rime, cold devouring speech) and charges the final image (exhale, corridors). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through professional bias ("ledger edges," "projection lens"). Micro-setting (lantern slide) evolves tactically and shapes the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens: measuring the fractured pledge reveals impossible values, leading to discovery of the second slide. Cost is unmistakable in the vow to "anchor even the vanishing," which reweights the stake and alters the library's state. One meaningful tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (vows as light, measuring absences) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to meaning-making via the protagonist's integration into the archive. Subtext operates in image and implication ("snowbirds made from filaments of vows").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful compression ("quartz hush," "alphabets of patience"). POV is stable and voice-motivated; elision (e.g., "meaning did not arrive as words") is taught and paid off. Diction remains within the character's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density and clear propulsion, though figurative language is dense in peak beats ("syllables stretched so thin they cut the light") without muddling clarity. No loops or scaffold; sentence-level rhythm varies naturally. Minor register elevation in climax, but closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of archival fantasy and metaphysical stakes, transformed through specific detail (magic lantern slide, sampling frequencies). Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens coherence, and the closure effect feels inevitable. No derivative echoes; vision is singular and fully committed.</comment>
