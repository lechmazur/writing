<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("my name slid away like a coin down a tide drain"). The final choice to map with forgiveness is earned by prior causality, showing a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The trait of sensitive perception constrains and enables action throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The final image of the house rising on "stilts of memory" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate and purposeful; the pattern of listening and discovery is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, actively pressuring choices and charging the final image. The ivy-veiled passage and film negative are micro-settings that constrain tactics and discoveries. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action ("the corridor hummed like a shell").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a single meaningful deepening—the discovery of the letter—that changes knowledge and reweights the dominant stake of legacy. The cost is legible on the page as the burden settles on the narrator's shoulders.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of legacy and listening emerges organically from events and images, resisting tidy morals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the final image of the map, which reweights prior material without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The voice is consistently poetic yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity. Purposeful elision (e.g., the "salt grammar of vanished tenants") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and dense, though a slight risk of overwriting exists in peaks ("ghost architecture"). No loops or scaffold; sentence-level propulsion is masterful. A single minor figurative strain ("plastic confetti skittered") prevents a higher score, but clarity is never harmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise is strikingly original, synthesizing climate fiction with a mythic occupation into a singular vision. The specific, grounded choices in character and world feel organic and inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
