<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion under pressure. The archivist's motivation to mentor resilience is dramatized through micro-choices, and the child's resolve feels earned. The final endurance forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, building through pattern and density toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost as the council understands reversible exile, and the persistent constraint of the library shapes tactics. Orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The library constrains choice (floorboards testing retreat) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the archivist's perception. The shadow in glass and tea leaves function as micro-settings that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the council's decree tightening pressure. Cost is legible in the archivist's trembling and the child's resolve. The stake—preserving memory versus survival—is signaled early and deepens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images and actions, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to reversible exile without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, particularly in the tea leaves and shadow corridor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off at closure. POV is stable and voice is consistent, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful, without muddle in peak beats. Syntax varies naturally to support rhythm and emphasis.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of memory, exile, and resilience feels inevitable. Risk-taking in structure and voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core concept of reversible exile is transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
