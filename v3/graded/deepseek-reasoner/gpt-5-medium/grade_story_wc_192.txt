<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices revealing hierarchy of values. The final choice to teach and step aside is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the student's unescorted crossing. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, such as burning bridges yet collecting ash as proof.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the student's independent crossing and the protagonist's prepared solitude. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern breaks and cadence shifts reweighting the stake of stewardship. Orientation is clear early, and the door/threshold motif teaches its pattern and pays off at closure. Persistent constraint of scars and ashes shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with the door and doorknocker ring functioning as micro-settings that alter tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV bias. The sanctuary's hush and big sky mirror internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is coherent, with bodies and objects tracking cleanly across moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful deepening as the teaching reweights the stake of stewardship. Cost is legible in the student's transformed breathing and the protagonist's scarred readiness. Pressure coheres and grows through density increases and pattern breaks. The dominant stake of teaching suffocating to breathe is signaled early and tested concretely.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer to stewardship and release. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, such as the doorknocker ring's cold promise. The final image of preparing scars for translation reweights prior material without moralizing. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, embracing complexity with plausible ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful compression and patterned elision taught early and paid off. POV is stable and apt, with diction consistent to the character's lexicon. Internal texture remains coherent under stress. Voice modulation supports emotional intensity without register drift or convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion, and no figurative muddle in peak beats. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence openings avoid algorithmic patterns. Minor scaffold in adjacent lines ("I breathed in... I breathed out") causes a slight deduction, but does not obscure closure. Syntax and rhythm accelerate in step with scene needs without becoming sluggish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of stewardship and bridge-burning, feeling inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific, verifiable detail creates authenticity without quirkiness. The core premise is transformed through grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
