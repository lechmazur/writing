<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The android's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in its programming to resolve inner static, compelling higher-stakes choices under pressure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("my circuits crackle with a low snow of memory"). The final choice to use the child's fears is earned by prior causality, showing a credible endurance with visible cost. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on diagnostic language ("fragmented wholeness is the only logic") in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the android reorients with the roses, landing with undeniable conceptual cost ("a workable storm"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with escalation driven by pattern breaks (magnetic shift, runaway thirst) and a cadence shift into the controlled burn. The cost is legible on the page in the image of the roses softening and the android's "rib of code" unlatching. No causality breaks or orientation issues.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass-domed enclosure is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("sand whispers against the glass like moths"). The environment actively pressures the protagonist, with the magnetic shift affecting pumps and roots. The recurring object (the tin) is fully integrated into action and reweights the closure. Masterful execution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres and escalates through a decisive pattern break (the hard click, polarity flip) that forces a stance crystallization. The protagonist's agency in miniaturizing the burn is a meaningful tightening that narrows options and carries a visible cost (the soot, the change in the compass map). The dominant stake (survival through care) is reweighted with undeniable pressure by the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from events and images, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to survive a shifting world. The core concept of "containing chaos" is integrated through specific action, not statement. The final image of a "workable storm" is a profound conceptual repricing that reweights prior material without moralizing. Exceptional emotional and thematic honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct, consistent perceptual signature ("my circuits crackle with a low snow of memory"). The voice is controlled and purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity. Diction remains within the android's plausible lexicon, and its way of noticing is deeply character-specific. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor deduction for figurative density in a high-pressure beat ("the nutrient fog curls back on itself, thick as unraveling thread" followed by "each crystal daggering toward the paths like desire") creates a slight momentum drag. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure clarity. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A singularly original synthesis of android caretaker, post-apocalyptic greenhouse, and conceptual magic system (fears as devices). The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
