<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with concrete micro-choices like taking only the brittle envelopes. Embodied emotion is strong ("porcelain cracks in her eyes"). Mother's characterization is slightly less developed but serves as effective secondary pressure. Final choice to exhibit without full confession is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong with pattern repetition (rocking chair, ash, hush) building toward resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost as mother's wrist squeeze acknowledges "the cost of surviving without a witness." Orientation is immediate and taught pattern pays off at ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: rocking chair, mask, and gallery all constrain choices and reweight meaning. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("smell like singed sugar"). Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (artistic truth vs. family silence) escalates through accumulative density. Protagonist's agency drives the escalation through concrete actions (grinding envelopes, scattering ash). Cost is legible in mother's gray resolve and the final somber marvel.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and actions rather than statement. The "mirage of safety" concept is fully integrated into narrative choices. Ending offers resonant non-literal answer through the rocking chair's movement and mother's acknowledgment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with consistent lyric compression. POV remains stable and voice-motivated elision is taught early. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext ("Take what you need"). Rhythm controls emotional pressure effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional prose density with zero scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("house exhales dust"). Syntax varies naturally with pressure. One minor register drift in "crystallize a fleeting emotion" but doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of artistic process and family trauma. The charcoal ash scatterer concept is fresh and irreplaceable. Risk-taking with accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transforms familiar themes through specific particulars.</comment>
