<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("guilt returned as steam"). The final choice to stay and ferry others is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern breaks (newspaper lines realigning) reweighting stakes. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final image of "rowing toward others." Orientation is clear by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices (labyrinth of doors, bioluminescent lake) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through POV ("glow as if blushing"). The lake as micro-setting alters tactics and outcomes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in the baseball burning and jars shivering. One meaningful tightening (choice to speak truth) narrows options and reweights stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images and events, offering a resonant non-literal answer to empathy's cost. No moralizing; the ending reweights prior material ("clean slate seeker found a ledger") without stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. Voice is consistent and purposefully compressed ("delicately robust"). Elision is taught and paid off at closure with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("jaded wonder draped everything"). No loops or scaffold; syntax accelerates with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of concepts (memory procedure, bioluminescent lake, time-travel baseball) feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors emotional truth.</comment>
