<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion under pressure ("my breath a metronome, my motive simple and ruinous"). The grandmother's presence creates a crucible relationship that forces choices altering their state. The final choice to rearrange debris into names is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with pattern density increasing through debris arrangements that culminate in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost ("a testimony is a bridge that cannot be unbuilt") and the persistent constraint of the lagoon shapes tactics. Time operates as a circular affidavit that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image ("waits like an eye sunk in cooled lava"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through professional archival perspective. Environmental details evolve causally with the pattern arrangements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens through deliberate debris arrangements. Cost is legible when the reverie scalds but the narrator doesn't look away. The dominant stake of uncovering truth tightens through patterned intensification that forces the confrontation with officials.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete actions and images rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "a city learning to read itself aloud." The kelp coil as "a ribbon pinned to courage" exemplifies thematic integration without moralizing. Complexity embraces both historical injustice and restorative truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled rhythmic compression under pressure. Purposeful elision taught early pays off at closure. POV remains stable with consistent narrative stance. Dialogue when present carries subtext and advances plot ("parley, not prayer").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with sentences advancing multiple layers. Minor figurative overload in peak beats ("reverie that blisters with civic songs") causes slight clarity drag. Generally clean propulsion with varied sentence structures supporting rhythm. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival work with magical realism feels inevitable. Risk-taking in circular time structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific, verifiable detail creates authenticity. The floating library concept transforms familiar tropes through grounded particularity.</comment>
