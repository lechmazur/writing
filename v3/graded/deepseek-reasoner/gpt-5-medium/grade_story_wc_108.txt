<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("My breath broke with the sentence, then reknit"). The final choice to reconcile rather than confront is earned by prior causality and shows visible cost. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the reunion scene. The trait "firmly adaptive" is demonstrated through on-page decryption and climbing actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly from discovery through decryption to roof reunion. Closure is a decisive change with visible emotional cost ("I felt terror and trust braid into something like promise"). Orientation is clear by line 4. The seashell's transformation and cast decryption create tight because/therefore linkage. Final image reconfigures the relationship with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Library setting constrains choice through isolation and the ladder/box mechanism. The seashell and cast function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("iron stacks groaned like ships"). Spatial choreography is coherent during decryption and climbing sequences. The rusted library actively pressures the protagonist's quest.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding truth about brother) escalates through decryption breakthrough to roof confrontation. Protagonist agency drives all key turns. Cost is legible in the emotional breaking and reknitting of breath. One meaningful tightening occurs when the decrypted message forces direct action. The final confrontation crystallizes stance with visible trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically through specific actions (trembling decryption, unarmored apology). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the braided promise image. Avoids moralizing; the brother's moral ambiguity remains. The seashell's transformation from empty to communicative charges the thematic development.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with professional bias ("pain had always been punctual and documented"). POV remains stable and deeply internal. Lyric compression serves emotional peaks without obscuring clarity. The voice modulates effectively under pressure while maintaining consistency. Elision (brother's exact debts) is purposeful and adds mystery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("Fear could be a lever, not a lock"). Minor template cadence appears in three "It said" phrases, but doesn't harm closure. Rhythm varies naturally with sentence length. No mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of stunt double psychology with library mystery. The brother's motive transformation feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific lived detail (broken bones dates, fake blood smell) anchors the concept. Risk-taking with lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The seashell's whispering mechanism is particularly inventive.</comment>
