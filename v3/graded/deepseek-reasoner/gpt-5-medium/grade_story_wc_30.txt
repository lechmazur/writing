<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Librarian's interiority is concrete and embodied ("hinge-hearted," "clockwork shoulders click softly"), with micro-choices under pressure (accepting contradictions, using the creel) revealing a hierarchy of values. The visitor's identity migration is less dramatized through action, but the librarian's final stance of endurance ("I will, as long as tides turn pages") is earned by prior causality. Minor deduction for the visitor's more thematic than action-driven presence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the librarian's final affirmation crystallizes the stakes of enduring wonder. Cost is legible in the image of the "bells cool to a hush" and the ongoing "clerkship of tides." The pattern of tidal imagery and identity flux accumulates pressure toward a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake of preservation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (the atrium's tidal nature dictates the librarian's work) and charging the final image. The bamboo creel and time metal are micro-settings that enable key actions. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action and perception ("smelt into bells that ring true").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase and cadence shift that reweights the stake of preserving identity. The visitor's request forces a tightening choice (smelting the cards) that narrows options and enables the final reconfiguration. Cost is felt in the transformation of the kelp coat and the bells' cooling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of preserving wonder amid flux emerges organically through concrete images and actions (the creel, smelting, shelving paradox). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the librarian's enduring routine. No moralizing; complexity is embraced through the acceptance of contradictions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature ("wintersun serenity," "salt-flecked panes"). Lyric compression is purposeful and taught early, paid off at closure. Diction and rhythm are controlled under pressure, though some syntactic density in peak beats slightly risks obscurity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. Minor risk of overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "minnows of thought skittering between ankles"), but figurative language is coherent and serves the Accumulative drive. No loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances atmosphere or story.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exceptional synthesis of identity, memory, and tidal mechanics into a fresh, organic concept. The combination feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is fully committed to and followed through.</comment>
