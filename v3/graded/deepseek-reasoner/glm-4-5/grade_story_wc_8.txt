<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eleanor's emotionally rational temperament is a consistent, defining trait that governs her methodical approach. Her motivation to rescue truth is clear and intensifies, compelling her investigation. The final act of collecting the evidence is a credible micro-choice that aligns with her established motives and values. However, her internal conflict and contradictory impulses are more summarized than dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal, with strong because/therefore linkages from the letter's clues to Eleanor's discoveries. Closure is a Decisive Change (DC) as she physically obtains the ledger, definitively proving the conspiracy. The cost is legible in the final lines: giving voice to the silenced and rescuing history from deliberate concealment. The orientation is immediate and the pattern of investigation is coherent and compelling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The disused railway station is not merely described but is integral to the plot, constraining Eleanor's search and providing the key evidence. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional historian's perspective (e.g., "camera capturing the carvings beneath the ivy"). The ivy itself functions as a recurring object and a potent metaphor that charges the final image of truth flourishing beyond its walls.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (uncovering the truth) is signaled immediately. Escalation is driven by Eleanor's agency as she follows the letter's clues, culminating in the discovery of the ledger—a meaningful tightening that forecloses doubt and proves the conspiracy. The cost is the human cost of the forgotten workers, made legible and given weight on the page, reconfiguring the historical narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of truth obscured by "noble lies" emerges organically from the specific investigation and the concrete details of the cover-up. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the truth will now "flourish beyond its walls," reweighting the entire premise of the historical narrative. It embraces complexity, showing the human cost of deception without resorting to moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The POV is stable and consistently filtered through Eleanor's rational, analytical historian's voice. The prose has a distinct, controlled texture appropriate to the character and subject matter. There is a slight tendency toward elevated diction ("languished," "palatable") that, while not clashing, slightly distances the narrative from immediate embodied experience in a few spots.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences effectively advance story and atmosphere. A minor instance of near-synonym churn exists ("concealment and intentional distortion"), and a slight register elevation ("industrial expansion palatable") is noticeable but does not significantly harm clarity or momentum, especially at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The core concept of "noble lies" is transformed through the specific, grounded lens of historical investigation and corporate negligence. The combination of a rational historian protagonist with an illuminated letter feels organic and fresh. The story commits fully to its premise, following the implications of the cover-up to a satisfying and earned conclusion without retreat.</comment>
