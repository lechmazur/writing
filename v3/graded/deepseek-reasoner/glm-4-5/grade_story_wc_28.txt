<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits ("gentle radical," "cradle empathy in arms of steel"). His retrocognitive trait is embodied and constrains his perception, and his final choice to rename the city is a credible micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values. The only minor deduction is for a slight tendency toward thematic articulation in his internal state, but it remains grounded in the concrete action of the ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, building pressure through density of imagery and a cadence shift during the renaming ritual. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reconfiguring the meaning of the ruins with a clear, felt cost of memory and loss. The final image of the "cathedral ceiling" open to the stars is the cost proof, making the conceptual price of survival undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables the protagonist's choice; the mosaic stepping stone is the crucial object that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's retrocognitive perception. The "shattered sky" and "cracked stones" are not merely descriptive but mirror the internal and external fragmentation, pressuring the central action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification via the renaming ritual, a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake of cultural memory. The cost is legible in the transformed perception of the sky and the gathered survivors' silence. The agency is his focused attention and the act of renaming, which forecloses the path of pure despair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of memory and renewal emerges organically from the concrete action of placing the tessera and whispering the name. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the transformed sky and the mosaic brightening, reweighting the prior desolation without moralizing. The concept of "aberrant mercy" is fully integrated into the character's action and the story's resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elias's poetic, melancholic perception. The prose has a distinct texture and rhythmic control, especially in peak beats like "rename. 'Samarkhand,' he breathed." The voice is consistent and effectively modulates between reflection and present-moment action without head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor deduction for a slight tendency toward ornate phrasing in a few spots (e.g., "aberrant mercy—giving names to places that had lost theirs—was his gift"), which creates a small momentum drag. However, the line-level craft is otherwise exemplary, with high information density and no loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic renewal with a retrocognitive protagonist and a mosaic-based ritual feels fresh and organic. The specific, grounded choices in character and world create a singular artistic stance. The core concept of "aberrant mercy" is transformed from an abstract idea into the driving force of the plot and character motivation.</comment>
