<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hemingway's synesthesia is a compelling, character-particular motivation that drives the narrative. His internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure are embodied and credible, particularly his decision to follow the key's pull. The final choice to use his gift for others is an Earned Stasis that forecloses a path with visible cost, felt in the key dissolving into his skin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive Conceptual Repricing: Hemingway's perception of the world is permanently altered, with the cost made legible in the final image of the multicolored lamplight. The inferred Causal lens holds strongly, with each beat ("because/therefore") motivated by the key's discovery and Hemingway's unique perception. The lighthouse door is a clean inciting incident that pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail that constrains choice and charges the final image. The pier, lighthouse, and sunken library are not just backdrops but active elements that guide the protagonist's actions. Sensory details are filtered through Hemingway's professional and perceptual bias, creating a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that supports the magical premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens. The dominant stake (discovering the nature of his gift) tightens meaningfully with each step: finding the key, approaching the lighthouse, and entering the library. The cost is unmistakable—the dissolution of the key signifies a permanent, irreversible change in his being and his duty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of perception as a sacred, communicative language emerges organically from the events and images, not direct statement. The librarian's explanation and the final image offer a resonant, non-literal answer to Hemingway's question without moralizing. The concept of "luminous vows" is fully integrated into the narrative's logic and emotional core.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and effectively filtered through Hemingway's perceptions, creating a distinct perceptual signature. The prose rhythm is controlled and purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity. The librarian's dialogue carries weight and subtext, though it is brief. There is no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "meteor hush of anticipation"), though it remains coherent and largely serves the tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lamplighter, a magical key, and synesthesia feels fresh, inevitable, and highly specific. The core concept is executed with full commitment to its implications, transforming familiar tropes through grounded, character-driven choices. The sunken library is a particularly ingenious and memorable inflection.</comment>
