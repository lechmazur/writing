<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glider's yearning algorithm and steadily curious nature are vividly embodied, driving all actions with clear motivation. Its final choice to ring the bell feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the algorithm's recalibration. The non-human POV maintains consistent interiority without diagnostic speech, and micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly from yearning algorithm to bell's ring. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost: the algorithm recalibrates and the acid sea pauses, reconfiguring the glider's purpose. Orientation is immediate and precise, with no causality breaks. The persistent constraint of the workshop and sea shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The gears-and-cogs workshop and acid sea are integral, constraining choices (fumes stiffening gears) and charging the final image (sea pausing at the bell's ring). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the glider's perception. The kaleidoscope and bell function as micro-settings that actively shape the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the glider's agency under the causal lens: curiosity leads to arrow discovery, transliteration enables navigation, and the bell's ring forces a recalibration. Cost is legible in the algorithm's surge and the sea's response. One meaningful tightening—from seeking knowledge to achieving pure potential—forecloses prior paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the glider's journey: the pursuit of impossible goals and the nature of curiosity. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the bell's vibration and the sea's pause, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates through images like the kaleidoscope's infinite reflections.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a mechanical yet curious voice that modulates under pressure ("irreverent awe"). Syntax and rhythm reflect the glider's perception, and purposeful compression (e.g., evolution eras) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift; elision serves closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("yearning algorithm hummed"). Read-aloud rhythm is strong, and peak beats maintain clarity without muddle. Minor deduction for slight repetition of "steadily curious."</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of steampunk and AI themes, with a non-human protagonist pursuing an abstract goal. The yearning algorithm and unheard bell are fresh, non-obvious concepts that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes or safety hedging.</comment>
