<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Alistair's transition from ennui to purpose is well-motivated and rooted in his loss of Elara. His final choice to become a guardian is an earned renunciation of his prior stasis. The emotional progression is credible, though the peak realization could be more embodied to avoid a slight diagnostic feel.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, redefining immortality as purpose. The causal lens holds tightly from discovery to portal. The final beat's cost is legible in the escondite's collapse. A slight deduction for the solar storm's role feeling more coincidental than causal in the initial discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is vividly rendered and evolves with the storm, charging the final image of its collapse. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Alistair's perception. It pressures choice by being the conduit he must leave behind.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Alistair's agency in manipulating the amulet, narrowing his options from observation to action. The cost is felt in the forsaking of his sanctuary. The dominant stake (discovery vs. duty) tightens convincingly under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of "what comes after goodbye" is answered with a resonant, non-literal image of "continuation." It emerges organically from Elara's revealed sacrifice and Alistair's acceptance, reweighting his entire existence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is consistent, with a distinct, elevated register fitting an immortal. The prose effectively conveys a perceptual signature. Minor rhythm issues in longer sentences prevent a higher score, but no head-hopping or clarity breaks occur.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and purposeful, with high information density. Minor issues include a occasional predictable cadence ("The hushed thunder...") and a slight over-reliance on compound sentences in high-pressure beats, creating a minor drag on momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bored immortal and a spatial mutiny feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to, transforming a familiar trope through specific, grounded choices in character motivation and world logic. The final reconfiguration is bold and coherent.</comment>
