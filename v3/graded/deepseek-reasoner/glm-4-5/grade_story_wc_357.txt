<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arion is a competent, goal-driven protagonist whose mission is clear. However, his interiority lacks contradiction; his realization about the arrow tip is a clean epiphany without internal friction or embodied struggle, feeling more diagnostic than dramatized under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal lens holds strongly, with clear linkage from mission to discovery. Closure is a decisive change (knowledge gained) with a conceptual repricing of the arrow tip's value. The cost, while conceptual (a changed understanding of his world), is legible on the page in the final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally vivid and integral. The floating arches and inverted rivers are not just backdrop; they actively constrain navigation and shape the protagonist's choices, charging the final image of the planet thriving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (discovering resilience) is clear and escalates causally through the inversion. However, the final revelation is delivered more through visionary exposition ("the echoes showed him") than a hard-won tactical choice by Arion, slightly softening the agency-driven pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of adaptation and resilience emerges organically from the specific events and the recontextualized arrow tip. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though the exposition from the echoes leans slightly toward summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, controlled texture that effectively conveys wonder and tension. The narrative confidently navigates the fantastic elements without losing clarity or the character's perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deduction for a slight repetition of "whirling silence" which, while likely intentional, edges toward a template cadence. Information density is high and propulsion is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The core premise of gravitational inversion is fresh and executed with specificity. The combination of sci-fi and ecological elements feels organic. It is strong, though the trope of a magical hereditary artifact providing the key revelation is a familiar story beat.</comment>
