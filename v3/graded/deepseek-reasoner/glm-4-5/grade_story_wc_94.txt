<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("fire burning within her soul"). The final choice to write and descend is earned by prior causality, though the "furiously tranquil" trait is more told than shown under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she finds her voice, with cost legible in the final image. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the pattern of storm and timer pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sensory and purposeful, with the observatory and storm constraining choice and charging the final image. The environment pressures her actions and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the storm and timer under the Accumulative lens, tightening the stakes of her vigil. Cost is felt in her decision to write and descend, though the dominant stake (publishing poetry) remains slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images of scars and suppression, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in silence and implication, resisting moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with a perceptual signature ("storm-kissed wonder"). Some elevated diction ("rarefy") slightly strains the POV's lexicon but remains legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong sensory detail. Minor overwriting occurs ("storm-kissed wonder" feels slightly decorative), but no loops or artifacts harm clarity. Momentum is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise is fresh and specific, synthesizing censorship and astronomy with emotional truth. The concept of "vigil in pause" is transformed through grounded choices, and risk-taking in structure heightens stakes.</comment>
