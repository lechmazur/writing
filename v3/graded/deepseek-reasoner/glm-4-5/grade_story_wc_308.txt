<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and his reverence is embodied, but interiority occasionally leans abstract ("something nameless within his spirit"). The final choice is earned, with visible cost in his tears and the relinquishing of his stones, satisfying the quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, landing with palpable cost as Kael places his stones and finds completion. The lens holds, and the persistent constraint of the canyon's history shapes his tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and integral, with the bone towers and canyon dust constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's deep connection to the place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the accumulative lens, tightening as the crows shift and guide him to the depression. The cost is legible in his tears and the relinquishing of his stones, though the final beat's transformation is slightly swift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of navigating through stillness emerges organically from the core concept and Kael's journey, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing, offering profound ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature and controlled rhythm. The prose is purposefully dense and lyrical, taught early, and pays off at closure without obscuring meaning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly crafted with strong rhythm, though it risks density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "pathways through dimensional spaces"). A minor paraphrase loop exists ("navigate without moving" appears twice in close succession), preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of stone-skimming, harmonic resonance, and metaphysical navigation is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with a singular, authentic vision that heightens the stakes.</comment>
