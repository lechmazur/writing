<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elina's motivation is clear and consistent, her reactively visionary nature is a compelling trait that drives the plot, and her micro-choice to share her discovery is a credible, earned action. However, her emotional state is somewhat monolithic, leaning heavily on a solemn, wise register without the contradictory impulses or irrationality that would elevate the characterization to the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held perfectly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the harbor is redefined by presence, not absence, with the cost of the herald's sacrifice legible on the page. The vision triggered by the valve provides a clear, causal because/therefore linkage that deepens the narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ivory harbor and the herald's trumpet valve are not merely descriptive; they actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The setting's evolution from a place of absence to one of presence is the story's central arc, and sensory details like "glistening stones" and "briny scent" are filtered through Elina's archival perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the accumulative lens: finding the valve and the diary deepens her knowledge and forces the key choice to share the truth. The dominant stake of healing is clear, and the cost of confronting painful history is felt. A slightly more visceral sense of immediate pressure could have pushed the score higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of "navigated absences" is masterfully integrated, emerging from the specific fragments Elina compiles rather than being stated. The final image of the harbor redefined by presence offers a resonant, non-literal answer. A minor deduction for the final paragraph's slightly explicit thematic summary ("shared understanding of what they had overcome").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that remains consistent and effectively modulates with the emotional weight of the subject matter. The controlled use of compression ("Through staggered intervals") and patterned diction serves the accumulative drive lens perfectly. No head-hopping or voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor instance of template cadence in the description of her visions ("each one another piece... each revelation arriving...") which prevents a perfect score, but it does not obscure clarity or harm the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core concept of an "ocean-spray archivist" navigating absences is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its lyrical, accumulative premise, and the transformation of the ivory harbor's meaning is a specific and ingenious inflection.</comment>
