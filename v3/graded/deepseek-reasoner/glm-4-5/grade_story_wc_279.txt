<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to discover meaning is clear and drives his actions, with his social perceptivity demonstrated through the tile flake's use. His final choice to disassemble the mandala is a credible endurance/renunciation, foreclosing a path with visible cost. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on the "lilac unease" label at peak intensity, which abstracts a complex state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the final image reweights the premise of the unlearning with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through the density of the sand patterns. The cost of Silas's renunciation is legible on the page in the act of disassembling his work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The whispering grotto is a masterful micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choice, its acoustics directly shaping the plot's climax. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Silas's perception. The grotto's "emergent hush" charges the final image, making the setting indispensable to the story's logic and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as Silas's deliberate adjustments to the mandala amplify the grotto's whispers and force a stance crystallization in the zealots. The cost is legible in the dissolution of their anger into wonder, a meaningful trade-off that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of finding meaning in chaos emerges organically from the particulars of the sand mandala and the grotto's whispers, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the end. The final paragraph offers a profound conceptual repricing without moralizing, deeply integrating the core concept of the "unlearning."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with excellent rhythmic control. The narrative certainty is well-calibrated to Silas's knowledge. A minor deduction for a single instance of slightly elevated diction ("momentous") that feels a touch outside the POV's established lexicon in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong momentum and information density. Figurative language is purposeful and cohesive. A minor deduction for a subtle paraphrase loop: "emergent hush" is powerfully introduced but reiterated several times without significant added pressure or detail, slightly dulling its impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a chalk artist, a sand mandala, and a whispering grotto to explore a conceptual "unlearning" is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, resulting in a singular and memorable artistic stance.</comment>
