<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's grim optimism and balanced daring are consistently embodied through micro-choices, culminating in a closure decision earned by prior causality. The chipped die serves as a physical manifestation of his internal flaw, and his final choice to bet carries visible cost, transforming his endurance into action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the plot progresses via because/therefore linkages from calculation to rupture. Closure is a decisive change (return to the bar) with a felt cost (the weight of eternity) legible in the final image. The mathematical proof's mechanics are established and pay off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is not merely described but actively constrains choice and charges the final rupture. The chipped die and satchel function as micro-settings that pressure tactics. Sensory details like the "click" of dice and "shattering glass" are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens, tightening through his methodical testing of hypotheses. The dominant stake (escape) deepens as his proofs near completion, culminating in a visible cost—the destruction of his prison—that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of perpetual motion and regret, resisting moralizing. The final image of rolling dice offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of seizing opportunity. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit phrase "texture of possibility" in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by mathematical focus. The voice modulates under pressure ("grim optimism" to "genuine hope") without losing coherence. Purposeful elision (e.g., the specific proofs) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences ("grim optimism" repeated in first and final paragraphs), but this does not obscure closure clarity or cause momentum drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of mathematical rigor and existential fantasy feels fresh and inevitable. The chipped die as a flaw in a perfect system is a specific, non-obvious inflection that heightens stakes. Risk-taking in conceptual integrity pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
