<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's brokenness and motivation are concrete and embodied, driving her actions under pressure. Her final subtle shift feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the repaired damage. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously, not alternating summaries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear cost in the final image of mended masks. The pattern of unraveling knots builds density that reweights the dominant stake. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and starlight are not just descriptive but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The net and needle function as micro-settings, integrated into action and perception with vivid, selective sensory detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a single meaningful tightening through the unraveling action. The cost is legible in the net's dissolution and the spirits' grounding. Stakes are signaled early and pay off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of silence and unraveling, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image of mended masks reweights prior material with purposeful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. POV is stable and apt, with voice modulating effectively. Elision is taught and paid off, and dialogue (though brief) is natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion; zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful, without muddle in peak beats. Syntax and rhythm vary naturally to support the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of silence-accumulation and spirit-unraveling feels inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise is fully committed to and transformed through lived detail.</comment>
