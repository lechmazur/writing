<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's emotional numbness and her "slicing through pretense" ability are concrete, embodied traits that drive her choice to feel again. Her final choice to embrace sensation is a credible endurance earned by prior causality, foreclosing her numb path with visible cost. A minor deduction for the "ego death" backstory feeling slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized in the present moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds strongly. The closure is a decisive change (brain's awakening, Maya's purpose found) landing on the page with felt cost ("embracing the pain"). The rewrite's temporal pressure coherently tightens options. The final image reconfigures meaning without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The floating dojo and brain jar are vivid and purpose-driven, with the jar constraining choice by being the central object of action. However, the dojo's properties are more atmospheric than causally active in altering tactics, preventing a higher score. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maya's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (consciousness autonomy) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the Causal lens, with the rewrite serving as a live clock that tightens decisions. The cost of embracing feeling is legible on the page and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of consciousness and identity emerges organically from the specific conflict, resisting tidy morals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of a future with "room for both," reweighting prior material without moralizing. The complementary opposites method is integrated into the thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and effective, with a distinct perceptual signature. Prose reflects Maya's numb state and subsequent awakening. Some minor register drift occurs in the more expository paragraph explaining the custody battle, slightly distancing the narrative from her immediate perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong information density. A minor deduction for a slight scaffold in the custody battle explanation paragraph, which risks slowing momentum. Figurative language is well-controlled and purposeful, especially in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of sci-fi tropes (clone custody, brain in a jar) with a deeply personal emotional arc is specific, fresh, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through with conceptual integrity, transforming familiar material into a singular, memorable piece.</comment>
