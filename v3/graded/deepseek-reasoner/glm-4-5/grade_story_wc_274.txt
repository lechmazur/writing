<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's internal conflict is embodied and specific, with micro-choices under pressure (e.g., her automated breath stabilizers struggling). Her final choice to upload the letter is earned by prior causality—the weight of the revelation—with visible cost (facing cryonic suspension). The trait "bravely conflicted" is dramatized, not labeled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds: the power fluctuation triggers discovery, which forces a choice with because/therefore linkage. Closure is a decisive change (uploading the letter) with felt cost ("prepared to face the consequences"). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the ending reconfigures her purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The "echoing library under snow" constrains choice (isolation enables rebellion) and charges the final image (silence filled with revolutionary potential). Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "thermal suit," "amber-light"), filtered through Elena's professional perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: the letter's discovery narrows options to report or rebel, forcing a high-stakes choice. Cost is legible on the page ("face cryonic suspension or worse"). One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and images (e.g., "knowledge cries out to be free") without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to who controls truth, reweighting prior material. Avoids thematic echo in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature ("the silence so profound her thoughts seemed to echo"). Diction remains within Elena's lexicon, and voice modulates with emotional intensity. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are N/A.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is concise and propelled, with high information density (e.g., "data frozen in amber-light"). Minor figurative language ("ripples spreading outward") is purposeful and doesn't muddle clarity. No loops or scaffold artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Premise offers a fresh synthesis of cryogenic archivism and political rebellion. Specific, grounded choices (e.g., "dormant networks") heighten stakes without gimmickry. The core concept ("contraband truths") transforms a familiar trope through lived detail.</comment>
