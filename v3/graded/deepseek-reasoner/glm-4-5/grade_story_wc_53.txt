<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cyrus is a well-realized POV with clear, specific motivation rooted in regret and eroded ambitions. His chronological confusion is a compelling flaw that informs his actions, and his final negotiation is an earned, decisive change. Minor deduction for slightly abstract phrasing in "eroded ambitions mirrored perfectly," which leans toward summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (merger with ghost, carousel restarting) with clear cost ("now-healed spirit"). The bridge of words coalescing from collected fragments is a brilliant, inevitable payoff for the taught pattern. Causality is tight and purpose-driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is a masterful micro-setting that actively pressures the choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective, vivid, and filtered through Cyrus's perception ("iridescent debris," "thick air hung heavy"). The camera wheel and harness are tactile tools that constrain and enable the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the outset (negotiate with ghost to return to past). Escalation is driven by Cyrus's agency under the accumulative lens—collecting fragments, building the bridge. The cost is legible in the dissolution of the camera wheel, a tangible price paid for the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of regret and reconciling with lost potential emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the carousel, camera, and ghost. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The "eroded ambitions" concept is fully integrated into the character's arc and the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical voice suited to the accumulative mode. The prose effectively mirrors Cyrus's fragmented consciousness. Minor deduction for a slight convergence in voice between the old woman's whisper and the narrative texture in her dialogue beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. It successfully walks a fine line but occasionally tips into mild overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "translucent images formed in the air before him in mesmerizing patterns"). A single, minor paraphrase loop exists ("fractured stillness" echoed shortly after introduction).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A highly original and specific synthesis of celestial mechanics, memory, and regret. The core concept of a kinetic lagoon and a disposable camera wheel as a temporal lens is fresh and feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking with accumulative structure pays off brilliantly at closure.</comment>
