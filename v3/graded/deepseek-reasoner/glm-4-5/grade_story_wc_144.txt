<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's blindness is not a label but a constraint that shapes every action, from diagnosis to repair. His motivation to "decode feedback into direction" is dramatized through his tactile, intuitive process. The final choice to repair and send the drone is a micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values—connection over isolation—with a quiet cost felt in the thinning mist and the ship's departure. Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding diagnostic speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the ship sails guided by Elias's hands, reconfiguring the teacher-student relationship across distance with undeniable cost in the final image of the depot's calm. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density (mist, light, sound) and a cadence shift at the drone's revival. Causality is tight—Elias's skill directly enables the ship's guidance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot and the water bowl are micro-settings that constrain choice (diagnosis method) and charge the final image (mist thinning as the ship departs). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—refracted light, creaking rigging—filtered through Elias's non-visual perception. The depot's atmosphere ("magnetic calm") evolves with the narrative, slowing time around his work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (maintaining connection) is signaled early through the damaged drone. Escalation is accumulative: the ship's impending departure tightens time pressure, culminating in the drone's repair and dispatch. Agency is fully Elias's; his skill drives the resolution. Cost is legible in the profound sense of connection he feels, though the escalation could be more pronounced under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme (connection through craftsmanship) emerges organically from the repair act and the final image of the guided ship. Subtext operates in gesture and implication—Elias's fingers "reading a braille only he could understand." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The core concept of repair transforms into emotional and relational mending.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied in Elias's sensory world. Voice has a distinct perceptual signature—noticing through sound, touch, and refraction. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure ("Craftsmanship like his couldn't be rushed"). No head-hopping or register drift. The elision of visual description is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density—e.g., "internal circuits exposed like vulnerable nerves" serves character, setting, and stakes. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with the ship's departure. Diction is specific and consistent with Elias's expertise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis: a blind artisan using light refraction to repair electronics is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through grounded, sensory particulars. Risk-taking in the non-visual POV heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination feels organic, not checklist-driven.</comment>
