<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is deeply integrated, with her paradoxical identity as an arsonist's daughter and firefighter compelling every choice. Her motivation to prove "scars can sing" is dramatized through concrete action (grafting roses, using black sand) and embodied emotion. The final choice to protect the grafts under fire is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in her whispered encouragement to the plants. A minor deduction for a single instance of near-diagnostic language ("unyielding compassion") which is quickly anchored in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), landing on the final image of the lagoon mirroring renewal, which reconfigures Maya's legacy with felt cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building meaning through recurring images (sand, coin, lagoon). One meaningful cadence shift occurs as the fire advances, tightening the stakes. A slight deduction for the cloud migration's mechanism remaining somewhat vague, though its effect on light and wind is felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and black sand are not merely descriptive; they actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The sand is used tactically in soil, and the lagoon serves as a reflective touchstone for Maya's internal state. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional and personal priorities (e.g., smoke-choked streets, graft union wax). The environment evolves causally with the fire and weather.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the advancing fire under the Accumulative lens, creating a coherent pressure that forces Maya's stance crystallization—to protect the grafts. The dominant stake (saving the symbolic plants) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. Cost is legible in the surrounding destruction and her focused protection of the roses. A minor deduction as the external threat's progression relies slightly on reported action (captain's radio) rather than fully immersive pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of transformation through scars is earned entirely through scene work and image (grafting, firefighting, black sand), never stated as a moral. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of adapted roses and the peaceful lagoon. Subtext operates powerfully in objects like the coin and sand, bridging past and present. Complexity is embraced without false equivalence regarding her father's actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Maya's specific perceptual signature—noticing graft unions, cloud light, and kelp-drift peace. The prose has a distinct, controlled rhythm that modulates with urgency. Purposeful compression (e.g., "gracefully alert") is taught early and pays off. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing multiple layers of story and atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("smoke-choked," "kelp-drift peace"). A single, minor paraphrase loop ("scars can sing" is whispered and then stated) occurs but does not obscure closure. Read-aloud rhythm is strong and varied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of an arsonist's daughter becoming a firefighter who uses volcanic sand to graft roses is a fresh, non-obvious angle that feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to and followed through its implications without retreat. Risk-taking in the accumulative, image-driven structure heightens stakes and coheres perfectly. Specificity anchors universals, avoiding generic templates.</comment>
