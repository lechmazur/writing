<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is concrete and consistent, with her "functionally creative mind" driving her choices under pressure. Her motivation to "puzzle out new equations for hope" is dramatized through her technical work and the discovery of the sextant's inscriptions, culminating in an earned stance crystallization. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the final paragraph ("chart a course toward the future") which feels slightly more declarative than her established internal voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Decisive Change under a Causal lens: her successful power restoration and discovery of the sextant's inscriptions reconfigures her options and knowledge. The cost is the hours of focused labor and the weight of the journeys the terminal represents, felt in the line "as if imbued with the weight of all the journeys it had guided." Causality is tight, with each beat motivated by the previous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is a crucible that constrains and enables choice, particularly the power center with its "dormant" transformers. The terminal itself and the sextant charge the final image, with the light resurrection mirroring the thematic navigation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's professional perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: the technical challenge of rerouting power narrows her options and raises the stakes. The cost of her focused labor is legible, and the successful reanimation of the lights represents a meaningful tightening that forecloses the path of mere curiosity and opens one of active creation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of the terminal as a navigational tool and the sextant's equations, culminating in the resonant, non-literal realization that this is a tool for navigating "hope itself." The final image of charting a course offers a conceptual repricing of the abandoned spaceport's potential without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, engineering-focused filter. Prose rhythm is generally controlled, though a few phrases like "stoic wonder" are slightly repetitive. The internal voice remains coherent and specific throughout, effectively conveying her thought process.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor deduction for a light template cadence in a few adjacent sentences starting with "The..." and a single instance of potential synonym churn ("wonder" / "discovery"). These are minor artifacts that do not obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of an abandoned spaceport, a civil engineer, and a nautical sextant is a fresh, non-obvious angle that feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of "redirected flows" is transformed from an electrical principle into a thematic one through specific, grounded choices in character and plot.</comment>
