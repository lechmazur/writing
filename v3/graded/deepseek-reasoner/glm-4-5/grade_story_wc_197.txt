<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling high-stakes choices. Her "carefully resourceful" trait is embodied in micro-choices like using the puddle's reflection. However, her internal conflict and embodied emotion are more summarized than dramatized in scene, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A strong causal drive lens holds throughout, with clear because/therefore linkages culminating in a decisive change. The closure is earned on-page with visible cost (Theodor's tears, sounding alarms). A minor orientation delay in the opening paragraph prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, with the auric lagoon and puddle reflection actively constraining and enabling choices. The phone booth key charges the final image. The setting is slightly underutilized as a direct source of pressure in the climax, capping the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, with the tripled patrols and changed protocols creating meaningful tightening. The cost is legible in the final escape under pursuit. The dominant stake of preserving history is tested and paid for on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of memory versus forgetting emerges organically from events and the final image of data streaming away. It offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. A slight over-reliance on the phrase "coded freedom" in the denouement trends toward thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, controlled texture. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like "the tyranny of indifference," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's internal voice in a high-pressure moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A few artifacts appear, including a mixed metaphor ("painted the sky in bruised purples and oranges") and a template cadence in the description of the lagoon's facade. These do not significantly harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a dystopian memory-erasure society with a grounded, resourceful rebel feels organic and specific. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical conclusion. The puddle-map device is a fresh, ingenious inflection that transforms prior material.</comment>
