<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silas's internal contradiction is vividly embodied in the egg's symbolism and his whispered words of renewal. His final choice, though quiet, is earned by prior causal pressure and carries visible cost through the rain washing away his footprints. The "secretly sentimental" trait constrains action credibly, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with closure achieved through Charged Poise as the rain falls and Silas hears imagined birdsong. Cost is legible in the final image of the egg disappearing and footprints being washed away. The persistent constraint of his manufactured drought shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The salt flat functions as both environment and mirror to Silas's soul, actively constraining his movement and charging the final image. Sensory details are purposefully selective (crunching boots, rain like bells) and filtered through his biased perception. The setting evolves causally with the breaking drought.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under Accumulative lens occurs through density increase (thunder, rain) and cadence shift that reweights the stake of preservation. Silas's agency in releasing the egg forecloses his path of pure profit with visible cost. The manufactured drought creates coherent pressure that forces his stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the egg's transformation from trophy to sacred object, offering a resonant non-literal answer about honoring loss rather than reversing it. The final image of "beauty echoing through time" achieves conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the juxtaposition of corporate destruction and personal redemption.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable and deeply embedded in Silas's perception, with distinct perceptual signature ("fractured landscape of white and gray that mirrored his own divided soul"). Syntax and rhythm modulate effectively with emotional intensity. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates high information density and rhythmic control, though minor metaphorical strain occurs in "fractured grace" which slightly muddles the established pattern. Otherwise clean propulsion with purposeful sentence variation. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of corporate greed and ecological conscience through specific, grounded choices. The concept of "preserving echoes" rather than reversing extinction offers non-obvious depth. Risk-taking in the quiet, internal climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
