<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is deeply rooted and consistent, with embodied emotion and a clear micro-choice to touch the fragment to the painting. The final choice is earned by prior causality, though the emotional cost of the transformation is slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost ("histories long overlooked flood into the present"). An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through pattern and cadence shift to a decisive moment that reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is a micro-setting that actively pressures the choice through its dreamscape quality and suspension. The lighthouse lens fragment, a recurring object, decisively charges the final image and constrains the protagonist's action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, culminating in the decisive act of touching the fragment. The cost is legible as the flood of histories, a clear reweighting of the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of honoring overlooked histories emerges organically from the grandmother's stories and the final act. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the glowing, solid fragment and the flood of stories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature. Minor repetition of phrases like "elusively tangible" creates a slight template cadence, preventing a higher score, but the voice remains coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and rhythmic, with high information density. A minor paraphrase loop exists with the repeated phrase "hidden details in paintings," and the description "elusively tangible" reappears, creating a slight scaffold that prevents a higher band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of the mystical object, the translator role, and the decoding of art feels fresh and inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details and a non-obvious moral calculus of honoring silenced histories.</comment>
