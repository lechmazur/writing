<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in profound grief, compelling his high-stakes choices. His interiority is concrete and particular, though some emotional descriptions ("bleak exhilaration") edge toward diagnostic labeling. His final transformation feels earned by prior causality with visible cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost—Elias's transformed perspective and the geode's new power are legible on the page. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through image density and cadence shifts. The "perturbation theory" mention creates a minor causality break, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating observatory and ruined garden are vividly rendered and purposefully selective, filtering through Elias's POV. The geode crystal functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ test. Sensory detail is balanced and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens, with the hunt intensifying through cadence shifts and density increases. The dominant stake (harvesting potential) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. Cost is legible in the geode's transformation and Elias's shifted stance, though the perturbation theory calculation feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of loss and possibility, resisting moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of repurposing grief. The geode's transformation serves as a thematic anchor without explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression (e.g., "intangibly tangible") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Minor scaffold exists in the repeated "bleak exhilaration" phrase, but it does not obscure closure or cause significant momentum drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The core premise synthesizes familiar tropes (post-apocalyptic scavenger, magical object) through specific, grounded emotional detail. The geode concept is fresh, though not entirely non-obvious. Execution is bold and coherent, with the emotional truth of grief providing authenticity.</comment>
