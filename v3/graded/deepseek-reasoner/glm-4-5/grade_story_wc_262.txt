<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear, rooted in a consistent and specific trait ("spatially imaginative mind"). Her internal conflict and emotional state are embodied and particular, not performed. The final choice to project the discovered love is earned by her established ability and personal need, with a visible cost in the single tear. A minor deduction for the near-label-speak of "spatially imaginative," which is stated but then powerfully shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elena's understanding reconfigures her purpose, with clear cost ("a storm contained within a single human heart"). Orientation is immediate and the pattern of sensory and emotional accumulation tightens decisively toward the final, transformative act of projection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The projection booth is a masterfully rendered micro-setting that actively constrains and enables the action, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply filtered through Elena's professional and psychic POV. The environment is a character, with the "dusty beam of light" and "dim red light" functioning as essential, tactile elements of the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift and density increase, reweighting the dominant stake of discovering unused love. The cost is legible on the page in the physical and emotional reactions ("hushed thunder," "single tear"). The escalation is driven by Elena's agency in deepening her psychometric reading.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of stored emotion, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to where love goes, reweighting prior material through the final image of projection. The exploration is complex, embracing the "bittersweet sacrifice" and "profound beauty" of preservation without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity without losing coherence. The controlled use of poetic compression ("hushed thunder," "quantum archive of feeling") is taught early and pays off, enhancing rather than obscuring the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor deduction for a slight tendency toward overwriting in peak beats, with a cluster of dense figurative language ("untended gardens of human emotion," "quantum archive") that momentarily slows momentum without breaking clarity. Otherwise, line-level craft is exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The premise is strikingly original, synthesizing psychometry, cinema history, and emotional archaeology into a singular, inevitable whole. The concept is committed to fully and executed with authentic vision. The specific, grounded details feel fresh and indispensable, far beyond a template plot. A clear example of publish-now originality.</comment>
