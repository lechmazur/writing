<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits, compelling higher-stakes choices. Her retrocognition is a well-integrated trait that constrains and enables her actions. However, her emotional state is occasionally summarized rather than fully embodied in peak moments, such as her "thistle-blown hope," which feels slightly diagnostic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the rekindled beacon restoring possibility. The causal lens holds strongly, with clear because/therefore linkages from her visions to her final act. The cost, while conceptually clear, is not fully legible in a single on-page sentence, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion is vividly rendered and participates in the action through sympathetic resonance. However, while it enriches atmosphere, it does not actively constrain Elara's choices or charge the final image to the degree required for the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, culminating in the decisive act of aligning the prism. The dominant stake (proving meaning in coincidence) is tested and paid off. The cost of her effort is felt, though the physical or emotional toll is not explicitly detailed on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of concept (shard of hush), character motive, and the final image of the beacon's light. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing, reweighting the story's premise beautifully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that remains consistent under pressure. The voice is controlled and effectively filters the world through Elara's retrocognitive, poetic sensibility. No head-hopping or register drift occurs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with high information density and purposeful rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight paraphrase loop ("coincidences had meaning" / "coincidences were not random at all") and the phrase "thistle-blown hope" risks register drift, though it is voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognition, a broken beacon, and a post-collapse setting feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of a "shard of hush" is a specific, non-obvious inflection that heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
