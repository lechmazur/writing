<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling his high-stakes choice. His interiority is concrete and particular, embodied in actions like his trembling hands and deliberate breaths. However, his emotional state lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, reading as a single-minded, focused intensity without internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a felt cost of relief. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through density and cadence shifts. The cost is legible in "the summoner exhaled with profound relief." A minor orientation hiccup exists with "terrestrially cosmic," slightly muddying the world's rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and purposefully selective, with the brook's rhythm harmonizing with the protagonist's pulse. The origami wing acts as a micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is balanced and integrated into action, though it leans heavily visual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is achieved through a decisive cadence shift and density increase that reweights the dominant stake. The cost of focused energy and relief is legible. However, the pressure feels internally generated rather than externally forced, limiting the sense of a tightening vice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of transformation and silence. The final image of the crane floating away offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates effectively in gesture and image, avoiding direct statement. The concept avoids tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filtered through the summoner's perceptual signature. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythm that modulates with pressure. Purposeful compression is used effectively. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are not applied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is lush and generally purposeful, but risks overwriting in peak beats with phrases like "tranquil blaze" and "terrestrially cosmic." A minor paraphrase loop occurs with "quiet brook" repeated frequently. The rhythm is strong, and sentences advance the story, but some figurative language feels slightly decorative.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of a solitary summoner and an origami crane feels fresh and specific. The core concept is executed with commitment. However, the prose's occasional decorative flourishes and the slightly familiar "hush the prophecy" trope prevent a higher score, placing it in the strong-but-not-exceptional range for originality.</comment>
