<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elian's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with a clear, conflicted motivation rooted in past loss ("the war had stolen their family thirty years prior"). Their "operatively gentle" approach is demonstrated through action, and the final choice to leave the clipboard carries a visible, felt cost of a "lifetime of solitude." A hairline slip: the final, diagnostic-sounding "proof that even amid conflict, life persisted" slightly abstracts a potent moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elian leaves the clipboard, a symbolic act that reconfigures the meaning of their work from a single victory to a perpetual practice. The inferred causal lens holds: the negotiation's success ("successfully navigated the first breach") leads to the harder work of the afternoon, which earns the celebratory wine and the contemplative final act. The cost is legible in the "bittersweet" victory and the image of the "debt carried forward."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The "ancient terrace" and "celestial bodies" are vividly rendered and pressure the scene through the "strange shadows" and the "sun directly above." The ebony clipboard functions as a micro-setting, its changing weight ("lighter, almost insubstantial") charging the final image. Points withheld from the 9-band as the setting, while atmospheric, does not decisively constrain a key choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start (end the war). Escalation is driven by Elian's agency under the causal lens: navigating the "first breach" leads to the "harder work" of concrete terms, forcing difficult concessions ("the concession of ancestral lands"). The cost is unmistakable in Elian's "personal redemption, the price of which had been a lifetime of solitude."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the climactic realization that peace is "not an event but a practice." This complex, non-literal answer to the central question is earned by the entire narrative, reweighting the earlier triumph and the final image of the left-behind clipboard. The theme avoids moralizing and embraces the story's core ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a perceptive, weary quality. The prose is generally controlled, though it occasionally drifts into a slightly elevated register ("ethereal glow," "impossible beauty") that feels marginally detached from Elian's grounded perspective in peak moments, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is largely elegant and purposeful. A minor deduction for figurative density and a register drift in the final paragraphs ("flawed, painful, beautiful complexity," "ethereal glow"), which slightly softens the impact of the powerful, simpler concluding lines. The closure beat remains clear and unaffected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The core elements are synthesized well, feeling organic rather than checklist-derived. The peace negotiator trope is made fresh through Elian's specific, wounded history and the story's focus on the practice, not the event, of peace. The concept is strong, though the celestial alignment and ancient terrace are familiar SF/F motifs.</comment>
