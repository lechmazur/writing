<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eira's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique trait, compelling high-stakes choices. Her synesthesia is actively used, not just labeled. The final renunciation feels earned, though her internal contradiction could be more dramatized in-scene rather than summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong. Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing where silence becomes a tangible presence. The cost is legible in the crowd's tears and the captured light on the music sheet, proving wonder's essential nature.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The glacial ice cavern is indispensable, actively pressuring the performance by refracting light and sound. It constrains and enables Eira's method, and its crystalline ceiling is integral to the climax, charging the final image with transformative power.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Eira's agency under the Accumulative lens, building density through the aurora's colors and the music's rhythm. The stakes—certifying wonder—are tested and proven with a visible, felt cost on the observers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of wonder's necessity emerges organically from the specific event, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the sculpted hush, reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a rich perceptual signature shaped by synesthesia. The voice is consistently lyrical and purpose-driven. Minor register elevation in peak beats ("unfetter the potential energies") is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, though occasionally dense with figurative language ("sculpted hush unfurled like a lotus"). A minor paraphrase loop occurs near the end ("wonder made manifest" / "wonder was not merely decorative but essential"), slightly dulling the closure's edge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of synesthesia, music, and light magic. The core concept of a "sculpted hush" is fresh and non-obvious, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking with a quiet, transformative climax heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
