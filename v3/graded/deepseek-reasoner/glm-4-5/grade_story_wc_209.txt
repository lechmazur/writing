<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her values. Her final realization is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her transformed artistic vision. The single POV maintains deep interiority without diagnostic speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative drive lens holds strongly, with pattern breaks that reweight stakes. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing through the cathedral window revelation, with undeniable cost in Elara's transformed perception. The orientation is clear early, and the closure effect is legible on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The amber pavilion and cathedral window function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's artistic POV. The environment actively shapes her revelation about light transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with the postcard discovery functioning as a pattern break that reweights stakes. Cost is legible in Elara's journey and transformed artistic vision. The dominant stake of understanding nocturnal blooming tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the glass-flower parallel, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars and images. The conceptual repricing carries undeniable cost in the final vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control under pressure. The POV remains stable and apt, with Elara's artist perspective filtering perception. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion and no figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with the emotional intensity. Minor decorative phrasing ("dancing like scattered embers") prevents higher scoring, but closure remains untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of artistic pursuit and botanical mystery feels inevitable in hindsight. The cathedral window revelation transforms the premise through specific grounded choices. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
