<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is exceptional, with embodied somatic markers and micro-choices under pressure. Her final renunciation of the photograph is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the outstretched arms. Contradictory impulses of love and loss act simultaneously in the closure scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the final image of outstretched arms. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through pattern and cadence shift. The lighthouse keeper mention slightly underutilizes its potential to pressure choices, but closure remains intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The arboretum and cliff setting actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The environment functions as a crucible, with the cliff edge enabling the photograph's release. Sensory details are purposefully selective and filtered through Maya's professional perspective as a gardener.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation builds through somatic markers culminating in the photograph's release, driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the physical act of release and sustained posture. The dominant stake of integrating memory with present resilience tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the pearl metaphor and final image, offering a non-literal answer to integrating trauma and resilience. No moralizing; the ending reweights prior material through the charged poise of outstretched arms. The concept of "anchoring optimism in realism" is fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled rhythmic variation under pressure. POV remains stable and deeply filtered through Maya's consciousness. The oyster shell metaphor is taught early and paid off at closure without voice leakage or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding. Minor paraphrase loop ("pearl of stillness" repeated) slightly dulls immediacy but doesn't obscure closure. Prose maintains propulsion through varied sentence structures and concrete imagery. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of trauma recovery with botanical healing feels inevitable. The pearl of stillness concept transforms familiar material through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
