<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique ability, with embodied emotion shown through tactile details like the telegram's smell. Her micro-choice to involve Dr. Thorne demonstrates growth, but her internal contradiction under pressure is underdeveloped—she moves from torment to revelation without visible struggle. The final collaboration is earned, though her flaw of isolation resolves too neatly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds: the telegram triggers telescope adjustment, leading to stellar decryption. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as shared burden unlocks healing power, with cost legible in "peaceful certainty that some knowledge was meant to be discovered not in isolation." Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory constrains choice—Elara uses the telescope to decode patterns—and charges the final image with "soft light of understanding." Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "daylily-pressed telegram smelled of distant places"). Professional details like celestial charts are integrated without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: Elara’s active adjustment of the telescope narrows options by revealing glyphs. Cost is felt in her relinquishing solitary pursuit for collaboration. However, pressure lacks sharpening—the discovery arrives without significant resistance or compounding complications.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens emerges organically through the telegram and collaboration, resisting moralizing. The ending reweights prior material via the "peaceful certainty" image. Subtext operates in gestures like Dr. Thorne’s "midnight solace" voice, though the theme echoes rather than deeply transforms.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("stars pulsed with secret knowledge"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though brief. Lyrical compression ("understanding dawning") is pattern-taught and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose has rhythmic control and high information density without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("slipping away like sand") serves pressure. Sentence variety supports momentum, though minor scaffold exists in "understanding was dawning" repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of celestial patterns and dream chronicling feels inevitable. Tropes (mentor-student dynamic) are grounded in specific detail. However, the concept lacks risk-taking—healing through words resolves without significant moral ambiguity or cost.</comment>
