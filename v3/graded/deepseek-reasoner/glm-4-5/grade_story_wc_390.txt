<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias's "logically emotional" trait is embodied through his engineer's precision guiding his ancestral duty, culminating in a credible, earned ritual performance. His internal conflict between panic and logic is shown simultaneously, not summarized, and his final choice forecloses a path with visible cost. Minor deduction for the slightly label-like phrasing of the trait itself, though it is dramatized effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly: the emergency broadcast and key's vibration compel Elias's race to the lighthouse, and his use of vibrational matching is the logical, earned culmination of his expertise. Closure is a decisive change with clear cost (the intruders defeated, protection renewed). The persistent constraint of his family legacy shapes his tactics and the final, charged image of his promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina and lighthouse are not just vivid backdrop; they actively pressure choices (the cracking ice, the cold stone wall humming). The crypt keeper's key and tuning fork function as micro-settings, constraining and enabling the climactic choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's professional and urgent POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the causal lens, escalation is tightly driven by protagonist agency: Elias's run, his sensing of the hum, and his deliberate ritual execution each narrow options and raise the cost of failure. The dominant stake (protecting the artifact) is tested on-page, and the cost of his ancestral burden is legible in the final image of his promise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of legacy and the fusion of logic and magic emerges organically from the fusion of engineering and ritual. The final image of Elias tending his light offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this central question. Minor deduction for the slightly overt phrase "fleshly ethereal," which risks stating the theme, though it is anchored in a concrete mechanism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elias's engineer's sensibility, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., "vibrational frequencies," "low hum"). The prose has a controlled, rhythmic quality that modulates with the rising tension. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally lucid and propulsive, with strong information density. A minor figurative muddle occurs with "cracked like distant bones," a slightly strained metaphor that briefly obscures clarity. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere effectively, with varied syntax and no significant loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse engineering, familial duty, and sonic magic feels fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. The concept is committed to fully, with the vibrational mechanics shaping the entire narrative arc and closure. The choice to make the protagonist an engineer provides a non-obvious, logical angle on a mystical premise.</comment>
