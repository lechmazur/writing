<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fisher's cool-headedness and transliteration ability are embodied through specific, pressure-tested choices like "voicing silence" to create stillness. His motivation burns steadily, compelling higher-stakes actions as patterns break. The final earned capture shows no diagnostic label-speak, with cost felt in the transformed rail spike. Minor deduction for slightly elevated diction in peak beats not fully matching his weathered persona.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly: density increases through emotional weaving, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the caught echo alters both fisher and constellations. Cost is legible in the rail spike that "now hummed with the captured echo." Orientation is immediate, and closure lands with undeniable conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden actively constrains and enables tactics, forcing the zigzag method. The rail spike as micro-setting evolves from tool to sacred anchor, charging the final image. Sensory detail is purposefully selective, filtered through professional priority (e.g., "vibrational blooms"). Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: each zigzag weaves denser emotional threads, narrowing options until the net is formed. Cost is visible in the constellations' disturbance and the spike's transformation. One meaningful tightening suffices, foreclosing other paths through his deliberate actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the fisher's quest for understanding, not power. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "what is fishing but the desire to touch something beyond oneself?" Subtext operates in gestures like "voicing silence," and the echo's capture reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature marked by professional bias ("auditory blooms"). Purposeful compression ("voicing silence") is taught early and pays off. Diction remains within the fisher's lexicon, though minor register drift occurs in "divine electricity." Rhythmic control under pressure is exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with varied sentence structures and read-aloud rhythm. Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "divine electricity" feels slightly jarring). No loops or scaffolding; closure image remains clear and potent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic and sensory elements feels inevitable. The core concept (sleepwalking constellations) is transformed through specific, grounded mechanics. Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The rail spike's evolution from industrial tool to sacred object is particularly ingenious.</comment>
