<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus's characterization is strong, with clear motivation rooted in a desire for truth rather than fame. His religious skepticism creates a compelling internal contradiction when faced with the supernatural. The final micro-choice to acknowledge his own swallowed truths is earned and carries a visible cost, embodied in the leaden weight and subsequent lightness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A Causal drive lens holds firmly: the discovery of the valve wheel directly leads to the radio confession, which triggers the vision and subsequent reconfiguration of the ghost shift's meaning. Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing where the factory's purpose is reweighted from supernatural to human tragedy, with cost felt in the "weight... like lead" and the final lightness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel is a pressurized environment that narrows Marcus's perception and guides his choices. The beaded valve wheel functions as a micro-setting, constraining the protagonist's action (kneeling, clutching) and decisively charging the final image with its cooled, released secrets. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, reflecting his professional focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the Causal lens: his decision to tune the radio and physically engage with the valve wheel triggers the vision that deepens his knowledge and reweights the stakes. The cost is legible in the visceral "weight... settled in Marcus's chest like lead," forcing a trade-off of his prior skepticism for a new, costly understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of unspoken truth and the power of confession emerges organically from the radio broadcast, the valve wheel's warmth, and Marcus's vision. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—that some truths carry weight because they remain unspoken—that reweights the ghost shift's purpose without moralizing. Complexity is maintained through the balance of skepticism and acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Marcus's professional, skeptical lens. The prose has a distinct texture, with a rhythmic control that modulates into shorter, more potent sentences during the vision peak ("workers vanishing... secrets buried..."). The internal voice remains coherent under pressure, though the radio psychic's dialogue is slightly less distinct than Marcus's rich interiority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent ("weight of a swallowed truth," "drowsy alertness"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift obscure the closure. The final paragraph's cadence shift effectively releases the accumulated tension into clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of industrial exploration, supernatural appraisal via talk radio, and a human tragedy at its core feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in the drowsy, visionary state heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
