<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is exceptionally nuanced, with her arsonist past and analytical intuition driving every choice. Her internal conflict is embodied in concrete actions like trembling hands and the micro-choice to sketch replicas. The final realization—using destruction to preserve—is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in the restored portrait revealing her own face. A hairline deduction for the slightly abstract phrase "volcanic tenderness" in peak moments, but it remains character-filtered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the plot builds through patterned discoveries (artistic trail, tapestry message) that culminate in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is a decisive change: Maya’s restoration of the portrait reveals her future self, reweighting her past with undeniable cost. The trail mechanics are taught early and paid off at closure. No causality breaks; orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The archive setting is vivid and purposeful, constraining choices (e.g., navigating dusty halls) and charging the final image (tapestry woven into the library entrance). Sensory details are selective and filtered through Maya’s expertise ("whispering threads," "invisible thread"). The tapestry fragment evolves from a connection to a tool for renewal, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (rescuing a forgotten promise) escalate through the accumulative discovery of clues, tightening Maya’s resolve. Agency is clear: she chooses to restore the portrait, using her arsonist knowledge to reverse damage. Cost is legible in the trembling hands and the realization of shared identity with the curator. A minor deduction for the trail’s off-page weeks, which slightly dilutes middle pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tapestry’s message ("Fire destroys, but art preserves") and Maya’s transformation. Subtext operates in the vandalized self-portrait and the final image of her future self. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to destruction and renewal without moralizing. The promise motif is fully earned through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, analytical voice that mirrors Maya’s expertise. Diction is consistent ("analytically intuitive," "volcanic tenderness"). Syntax varies effectively, though a few repetitive stems ("Maya's fingers trembled") appear. No dialogue, so evaluated solely on internal voice and narrative control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical, with strong rhythm and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language ("volcanic tenderness") is pattern-taught and paid off. Minor deduction for synonym churn ("forgotten promise" echoed as "broken promise") and a template cadence in two consecutive sentences starting "Maya's..." near the end. Clarity remains uncompromised.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—arsonist-turned-archivist—is fresh and fully committed. The tapestry and artistic trail are ingeniously integrated, transforming familiar tropes through specific detail. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight, with no derivative echoes.</comment>
