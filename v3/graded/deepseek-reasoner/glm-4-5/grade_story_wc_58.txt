<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The traveler's characterization is deeply specific and embodied, with his contradictory impulses (blessing/curse of his gift) acting simultaneously. His final choice to write his own obituary is earned by the prior causality of his reflections and the tactile trigger of the weft thread. A minor deduction for a brief moment of near-diagnostic language ("projection of presence" as a "defense") in a high-pressure beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Decisive Change (writing his own obituary) with clear, felt cost, landing cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The palace thread and garden setting are expertly woven into the pattern that culminates in this change. The inferred lens is clear and holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The shadowed garden is not merely a backdrop but a crucible that constrains the traveler's choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and deeply filtered through the POV, with the autumn setting and the weft thread actively shaping the narrative's emotional and thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the traveler's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from observing the gardener's loss to confronting his own. The cost of this introspection is legible on the page. A slight deduction as the middle reflective passage, while beautiful, creates a minor, momentary flattening of immediate pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of "explained absences" and the "geography of healing" emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the weft thread, the obituaries, and the garden. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the thread as a "compass pointing toward wholeness," avoiding any direct moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly calibrated to the traveler's introspective nature. POV is stable and the prose possesses a strong perceptual signature. The single moment of slightly elevated diction ("intimate communion") is voice-motivated and does not disrupt the overall control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a subtle template cadence in the sentence structure of two consecutive reflective sentences mid-story ("His obituaries for others... The autumn deepened..."), which slightly dulls the momentum in an otherwise flawlessly crafted piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise of writing obituaries for the living is fresh and transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and theme. The synthesis of the traveler's profession, the weft thread, and the garden feels organic and inevitable, resulting in a singular and memorable artistic stance.</comment>
