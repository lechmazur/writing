<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though phrases like "scattered pieces draw closer to alignment" verge on abstract summary. The final renunciation is earned with visible cost in trembling hands and fulfilled purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strong; pattern of weaving memories through song escalates to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Cost is legible in the keeper's effort and the realm's awakening. Orientation is clear by ~120 words with mica window and orchard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with the alchemical orchard and mica window constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and integrated into action, reflecting the keeper's urgency and priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by keeper's agency under accumulative lens, with urgency quickening steps and song strengthening. Cost is felt in the keeper's effort and the realm's response. One meaningful tightening (completing the weave) is sufficient for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and community emerges organically through concrete actions and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the woven dawn restoring connections, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and purposeful compression (e.g., "bound release") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor figurative stacking ("fractured glass," "gossamer threads") is pattern-taught and functional. No loops or scaffold artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Concept is highly original—woven dawns from memories—and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Synthesis is specific and non-obvious.</comment>
