<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and intensifies, her "sharply observant" trait is embodied in action, and her final choice to protect the knowledge is a credible endurance with visible cost. However, her internal contradiction and emotional embodiment under peak stress could be more textured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A strong causal lens drives the plot from discovery to revelation. Closure is a charged poise—Maya's decision to build a resistance—with cost felt in the threat of corporate discovery. The final image of hope reconfigures the stakes effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is vividly rendered and purposefully selective. It constrains choice (toxic soil) and charges the final image (trees bending, diamond pulsing). Sensory details are filtered through Maya's professional bias, creating a cohesive, pressurized environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from curiosity to global consequence via the reassembled letters. The dominant stake (truth vs. corporate control) tightens as Maya's discovery forecloses her option of anonymity, forcing her into a new, dangerous role as keeper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between excavated truth and comfortable lies. The final image of hope as the one thing corporations can't liquidate offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, analytical texture. The prose effectively filters the world through Maya's debunker lens. Some minor telling in the final paragraphs slightly reduces immediacy but does not break voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong information density. A minor scaffold artifact exists ("hope was the one thing...") in the final line, which summarizes a theme already shown, slightly dulling the closure's edge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a conspiracy debunker in a radioactive wasteland uncovering a dimensional energy source feels fresh and specific. The concept is fully committed to, and the flawed diamond as a key is a non-obvious, ingenious inflection.</comment>
