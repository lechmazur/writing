<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion ("featherly determination") and micro-choices (tracing wood grain). The father's late appearance crystallizes her arc, though his dialogue edges toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (reunion) with cost legible in the father's tears. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the oak doorway pattern payoff is earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is integral, constraining choices (wood grain analysis, violet light pillars) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under accumulative pressure; the oak doorway discovery narrows options with cost ("air thickening like water"). Stakes are consistently tied to thresholds and transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images (thresholds, wood grain, logbook). The ending offers a non-literal answer to the sacredness question, though the father's dialogue slightly moralizes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent with poetic compression ("featherly determination," "fractured hush"). POV remains stable; elision (e.g., butterfly effect) is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic with minimal scaffolding. Minor figurative overload in "air thickening like water" slightly muddles peak beat, but clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of surreal and emotional elements; the logbook-wood grain-threshold integration feels inevitable. Risk-taking in poetic compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
