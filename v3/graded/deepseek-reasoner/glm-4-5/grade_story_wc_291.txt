<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elena's face-blindness is a unique, character-particular trait that directly informs her method and motivation. Her micro-choices under pressure, like tracing the quarry wall and cross-referencing documents, reveal a consistent, methodical nature. The final choice to accuse the assistant is earned by prior causality, though the cost to her is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal drive lens is clear and holds: each investigative step logically narrows the possibilities. The closure is a decisive change (confession) with a clear cost—the community's forced awakening from willful forgetting. The orientation is immediate, and the final image of receding mist effectively signals the cost's legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The quarry is a purposeful, atmospheric setting that pressures the investigation through its isolating mist and preserved "indentations," which directly constrain Elena's choice by providing physical evidence of the struggle. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her professional POV, though the description is more functional than deeply textured.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elena's agency under the causal lens: her methodical process of elimination meaningfully tightens the options. The dominant stake (justice/awakening empathy) is signaled early. The cost—forcing a community to confront a buried truth—is conceptually clear, though its visceral impact on Elena is slightly muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of Elena's unique perception and the community's chosen amnesia. The final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of dormant empathy without moralizing. The concept of seeing differently is deeply woven into the plot and character.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filtered through Elena's perceptual signature of shapes and textures. The prose has a distinct, controlled rhythm. The single line of dialogue is goal-driven and natural. Purposeful compression is used effectively to maintain momentum without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is concise, propulsive, and largely free of artifacts. Sentences vary in structure and length to create a compelling rhythm. Information density is high, with lines often doing double duty (e.g., describing the quarry while establishing mood). No loops or scaffold issues were detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a face-blind portrait artist and a cold case investigator is a fresh, non-obvious, and highly effective premise that feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully committed to and executed with specificity, transforming a familiar trope through grounded, character-driven choices.</comment>
