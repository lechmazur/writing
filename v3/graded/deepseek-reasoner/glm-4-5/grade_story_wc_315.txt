<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pattern seeker's interiority is concrete and embodied, with muscle memory and professional competence compelling high-stakes choices. The final choice to transmit the urgent message is earned by prior causality. A minor deduction for "soundless echo" and "actionable intelligence" bordering on diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Charged Poise as the protagonist transmits the urgent message, reconfiguring stakes with undeniable pressure. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through layered repetition of motifs. A -0.3 orientation penalty is applied for delayed clarity on the "hanging homes" civilization, which isn't fully anchored until later.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor is vividly rendered and pressures choice through its thin atmosphere and isolation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through a professional POV. However, the setting does not quite constrain a choice or decisively charge the final image, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the emergency protocol and atmospheric anomalies creating a decisive intensification. The cost is legible in the quickening heart and dread, narrowing options to a necessary transmission.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the watcher's burden and the mathematics of survival, resisting moralizing. The final image of transmitting with clarity offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of trust under pressure. Avoids thematic echo, though the core concept is occasionally stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with a controlled, rhythmic prose that modulates with pressure. POV is stable and consistent, with elision (e.g., the nature of the threat) taught and paid off in the final transmission. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with high information density, but suffers from a template-cadence issue. The repetitive use of the story's required elements as sentence openers ("The watcher's burden," "Attentively inventive," "Remembering through muscle memory") creates a noticeable pattern that slightly dulls momentum, though it doesn't break closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a solitary watcher in an arboreal kingdom above the clouds feels fresh and specific. The core concept of translating celestial patterns into survival wisdom is a non-obvious angle executed with commitment. A slight cap from the minor prose artifact prevents a higher score.</comment>
