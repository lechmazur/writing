<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is concrete and embodied, with his weariness and stubborn persistence driving his choices. His motivation to "give rest a permanent address" is dramatized through his actions, culminating in a credible renunciation of his old life. A hairline deduction for a minor diagnostic label ("inadvertently stubborn") in the setup, though the trait is later proven in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds firmly. The closure is a decisive change (becoming the keeper) with a clear, felt cost (enduring the "chased stillness" of the deep). Causality is tight, with each beat motivated by the last. The orientation is immediate and the final cost is legible in the closing image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is a masterclass in selective, purposeful detail. The underwater library is not just described but actively pressures choices and charges the final image. Sensory details are filtered through Elias's professional POV, and the environment's "impossible spaces" are integral to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, pressure escalates cleanly through Elias's stubborn pursuit. The dominant stake (finding purpose/rest) is tested and deepened at the library, forcing a high-stakes choice with a visible cost. A minor deduction for the captain's favor feeling like a minor convenience, though it doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of finding purpose in preservation emerges organically from the particulars of the story. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The core concept of giving rest an address is fully integrated and reweighted by the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, weary voice that modulates under pressure. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic quality that supports the tone. No head-hopping or register drift. Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A few minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight synonym churn ("chased stillness" repeated) and a template cadence in one beat ("He rented... He descended..."). These do not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of undertaker and underwater library keeper is fresh, inevitable, and highly specific. The premise is transformed through grounded character choices and a unique, coherent world logic. Risk-taking in the setting's "impossible spaces" heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
