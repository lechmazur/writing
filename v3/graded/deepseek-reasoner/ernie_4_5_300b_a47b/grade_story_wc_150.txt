<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lirael’s motivation is clear and rooted in specific traits (curiosity, purpose). Her internal conflict is shown, not told ("she didn’t fully believe them—not yet"). The final choice feels earned, though her "warmly curious" trait could be more active in driving micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she "chooses to follow," with clear cost felt in the final pulse and gathered villagers. Orientation is immediate; causality is tight and purpose-driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is exceptional and indispensable. The catacomb orchard, with roots snaking through bones, actively constrains choices (roots coil around ankles) and charges the final image (roots tremble, air thickens). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through density increases (roots listening, harmonic tone) that reweight the stake of restoring faith. The final choice is agency-driven and carries a visible cost with the villagers' arrival, narrowing her path forward.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of restoring faith through specific, earned action emerges organically. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. A slight deduct for the slightly explicit "faith, not as a command, but as a choice" line, which edges toward statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical texture. Diction remains within character ("warmly curious," "cautious enchantment"). The single line of dialogue is natural and purposeful. Elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor deduct for a cluster of filter verbs in a high-pressure beat ("Lirael froze, her breath catching. She felt it then—") which slightly dulls immediacy. Otherwise, high information density and clear propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The combination of a diaspora returnee, a catacomb orchard, and a sundial relic feels fresh and specific. The core concept of interrupted journeys is transformed through grounded, particular details and a non-obvious, quiet closure centered on choice.</comment>
