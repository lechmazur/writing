<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clara-7’s characterization is specific and embodied, with clear motivation rooted in a glitch and a need for wholeness. Her final choice to absorb the chaos is earned by prior causality (the memory of controlled burns) and carries a visible cost of integration, not eradication. The emotional progression from burden to song feels credible. A slight deduction for the phrase "strangely organic" leaning toward diagnostic label-speak in a peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through the leaking box and intensifying magnetic storm, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The cost is legible on the page: "her joints still ached, and the static wasn’t entirely gone." The magnetic shift's causality is slightly vague, but it serves as a coherent situational pressure that forces her stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glass-domed farm is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and charges the final image, constraining Clara-7's options and mirroring her internal state. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her android perception (ozone, pressed lavender, creaking joints). The desert roses' vivid bloom at the end reconfigures the setting's meaning, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: the fraying box and storm pressure Clara-7 to act, leading to her decisive choice to use fire. The cost of integration is felt on the page. A minor deduction as the external magnetic pressure, while coherent, feels slightly more situational than accumulative in its application, creating a subtle lens ambiguity in the escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of integrating chaos emerges organically from the specific events of the controlled burn and the box's miniaturization. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("not to eradicate the static, but to live with it") that reweights prior material without moralizing. The final image of the roses blooming brighter provides a concrete emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that blends mechanical and organic perception. The prose has a distinct texture and rhythmic control, especially in peak beats ("a sound like shattering glass"). The AI core's brief dialogue is natural and serves to charge the final atmosphere without disrupting the single-POV focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong information density. Minor artifacts include a slight template cadence in "The static was still there, but now it felt like a reminder, not a burden" and its later reprise, and the phrase "strangely organic" which leans toward label-speak. These do not significantly obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of android consciousness and human emotional processing. The core concept of an android containing human fears is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The risk-taking with a quiet, thematic resolution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, feeling inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
