<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's internal contradiction between order and wildness is embodied in micro-choices like touching the quartz. Her final stance crystallization feels earned by the bear's symbolic pressure, with visible cost in her renewed but altered commitment to the keep.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensory details (petrichor, quartz hum) deepen toward Charged Poise closure where options reconfigure. Cost is legible in "heart a pendulum swinging between fear and hope." Orientation is clear by paragraph two.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt and petrichor actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are purposefully selective (e.g., "ink-stained fingers," "rain-soaked stone") and deeply integrated with POV perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stake (freedom vs. safety) escalates through the bear's paradoxical presence and the forecourt's song, forcing a stance crystallization. Agency resides in Lira's decision to listen differently, with cost in her altered relationship to the keep's order.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through resonant images (pendulum, compass) without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer: silence becomes a space "where dreams breathe," reweighting prior material through earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature favoring mechanical and sensory lexicon. Lyric compression ("glacial hush") is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic without artifacts. Figurative language ("heart that ticked") serves character and atmosphere. Sentences propel momentum ("She would scribe clocks by day, but by night...") with no loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of wildness and order feels inevitable. The bear as non-threatening catalyst transforms the trope. Specificity (clock scribe, crystal forecourt) avoids generic fantasy, and risk-taking in quiet climax heightens stakes.</comment>
