<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias is vividly realized through concrete, embodied perception ("dynamically observant") and a clear, escalating motivation to understand the flake and Marisol's disappearance. His final choice to play feels earned by prior causality. A slight deduction for the "voice like rusted hinges" descriptor, which feels slightly authorial rather than filtered through his specific perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias gains new understanding and agency. The drive lens is a Hybrid, leaning Accumulative/Textural early (sensory pattern-building) and Causal at the end (the fiddle playing causes the shift). A minor causality break exists: the flake's mechanics and the "scaffold wrap flutters" are introduced via summary rather than discovered through action, slightly weakening the linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is exceptionally integrated, functioning as a crucible that pressures choice. The mountain pullout's specific scent ("pine resin and old engine oil") and the flake itself ("micro-setting") are not just atmospheric but actively constrain and enable the protagonist's actions, directly charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the Hybrid lens, pressure escalates coherently from curiosity to a decisive, high-stakes action (playing the fiddle). The dominant stake (understanding/accessing the "pixelated amnesty") is clear and tightens meaningfully. The cost of this choice—entering an unknown, reconfigured reality—is legible on the page, though the conceptual price could be slightly more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of rewriting history from the "ashes of 'never'" emerges powerfully from the core concept and Elias's final, charged choice. It avoids moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image. It is slightly held back from a higher band by the aforementioned summary-based introduction of key concepts ("scaffold wrap flutters").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by a distinct perceptual signature ("the way the wind curled around the pine boughs"). The voice is consistent, lyrical, and effectively modulated under pressure. The purposeful elision of the hitchhiker's departure and the flake's origin is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm, vivid imagery, and excellent information density. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in a high-pressure beat ("the music becoming a whirlwind, the pixels... swirling into a vortex"), which creates a mild sense of abstraction at a pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of folk tradition (bridge-song), archaic technology (wet-plate collodion), and a sci-fi/fantasy concept ("pixelated amnesty") is highly original and feels organic, not checklist-driven. The specific, grounded voice and setting make the premise feel fresh and inevitable.</comment>
