<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in his role as an observer, with his final realization feeling earned by his prior study and the specific, embodied experience with the stone and birds. The micro-choice to sit and focus with the arrowhead demonstrates his values and leads to a credible internal shift. A slight deduction for the repeated phrase "weathered resolve," which edges toward a label.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kael achieves alignment, not through a physical act, but a conceptual repricing of the pulse's nature. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through pattern recognition (birds, carvings) that culminates in his understanding. Cost is legible in the foreclosed path of his people's historical reverence and his own decades of failed study.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The bone towers and canyon echoes are not just backdrop; they are the literal and figurative structure upon which the entire conflict and its resolution are built. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and perfectly filtered through Kael's professional and reverent perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from observation to active engagement with the arrowhead, which deepens his knowledge and narrows his options toward the final realization. The cost is the abandonment of his people's traditional, static understanding of the pulse, a tangible conceptual price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of navigating through alignment rather than movement emerges organically from the specific particulars of the birds' flight, the carved symbols, and the arrowhead's vibration. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. The integration is seamless and profound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, with a perceptive, almost musical quality that matches the story's concept. The prose effectively uses compression and patterned language ("through centuries of layered dust"). A minor deduction for the slightly repetitive phrasing of "pulse left wandering," which, while thematic, is used multiple times.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is largely strong with vivid, purposeful imagery and good rhythm. However, it exhibits minor text artifacts: the phrase "weathered resolve" is used twice, and "pulse left wandering" appears three times, creating a slight template cadence. These repetitions are the only factor preventing a higher score, though they do not seriously harm clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core concept of a "pulse left wandering" and the role of the harmonic stone skimmer feel fresh and specific. The combination of a mystical force with the very concrete, tactile method of reading bird patterns is an original and ingenious synthesis. It fully commits to its premise without retreat.</comment>
