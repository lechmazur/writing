<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lila's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her trembling hands and somatic choices under pressure feeling earned. Her final micro-choice to tuck away the photograph without freezing demonstrates a credible, earned endurance. The only minor flaw is a slight diagnostic whiff in "PTSD," but it's immediately dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building through sensory details toward a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands with clear, felt cost as Lila's heart is "steady" and she carries the "pearl of stillness." Orientation is immediate and the taught pattern of somatic markers pays off decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively constraining and enabling Lila's choices. The cold stone bench and lavender sprig are tactile somatic markers; the cliff and sea charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and perfectly filtered through her urgent need for stillness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a single, meaningful cadence shift: the gust of wind triggers a flashback, which is then overcome by the somatic anchors. This deepens the stake (mastering her trauma) and reweights it with visible cost—her steady heart at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of anchoring hope in realism emerges organically from Lila's struggle and Mrs. Voss's guidance, culminating in the final, non-literal realization that the "pearl of stillness" is a "lens." It avoids moralizing, offering a resonant answer through image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lila's perception. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity without losing coherence. Mrs. Voss's dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext and advancing the thematic core.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language ("pearl of stillness") is pattern-taught and pays off. Sentences vary effectively to mirror Lila's internal state, from frantic to calm. Read-aloud rhythm is exceptional.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of trauma recovery, somatic therapy, and a gothic-tinged setting feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is transformed through grounded, specific choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
