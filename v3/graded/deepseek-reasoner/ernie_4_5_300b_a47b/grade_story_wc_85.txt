<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's guilt and professional conflict are embodied and drive his choice to reveal the truth. His internal contradiction—a liar seeking truth—is dramatized under pressure. A minor deduction for a hint of diagnostic language ("guilt twisted, sharp and familiar") in a peak beat, but the final renunciation of his trade is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly: each driftwood discovery narrows options and changes knowledge, leading to a decisive change (rejection of false memory manufacture). Closure lands on the page with cost ("drowning in the sound"). Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and driftwood shore are micro-settings that pressure choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("air tasted of salt and secrets"). The watch and driftwood are recurring objects that constrain tactics and reconfigure meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: each carved discovery tightens the stake and forecloses the option of lying. The cost of truth-telling is legible and charges the final image. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of buried truth emerges organically from the driftwood mosaic and Elias's arc. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The "sieved hush" is a concept that is repriced from absence to palpable space.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, professional filter. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture that modulates with emotional intensity. The "sieved hush" phrase is purposefully repeated and paid off at closure, teaching its pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythm and varied syntax. A minor deduction for a slight repetition of the "sieved hush" concept, which borders on ornamental in its second use, but it does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffold issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The premise of a black market genealogist using driftwood carvings is a fresh, specific synthesis. The unconventional method shapes the entire narrative and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
