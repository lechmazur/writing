<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cedar's characterization is strong, with embodied emotion and a clear, compelling internal conflict rooted in his molting trait. His micro-choices, like sharing the poem with Marla and writing at the end, reveal his values. Marla is functional but slightly underdeveloped, serving more as a reflective surface than a full crucible. The final choice to embrace the chaos feels earned by the discovered poem.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through density and pattern. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Cedar's realization reweights his premise. The cost is legible in the final image of the city's hunger versus the library's fragile bloom. One meaningful cadence shift occurs with the discovery of the new poem, which deepens his options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the story's mood, with the rusted library and flickering bulbs creating a potent atmosphere. The coffee tin functions effectively as a micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image. The sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Cedar's poetic POV. It does not, however, physically pressure a key choice, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive intensification: the tin feels heavier, and the new poem forces a conceptual deepening. The dominant stake of self-preservation/understanding is clear. Agency is demonstrated through Cedar's choice to write and reinterpret his mantra. The cost is felt in the final, fragile image of something blooming against the indifferent city.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "blooming resistance" and the specific particulars of the tin, the poems, and the molting. The final realization—“to forge beauty from anarchy, you must first become the anarchy”—is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the prior material without moralizing. The piece earns its wisdom through concrete struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature evident in phrases like "luminous fracture against the darkness." The prose is controlled and rhythmic, effectively modulating with emotional intensity. The limited dialogue is natural and carries subtext. There is a single, minor instance of slightly elevated diction ("earthquake" for the mental shift) but it does not break clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is largely excellent with high information density and strong rhythmic control. A minor artifact occurs in the peak beat: the metaphor "like an earthquake" for the mental molt is a slight register drift that feels a touch overstated for the POV's established voice. This prevents a higher score, though it does not seriously obscure the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The core concept of a personality-molting poet is highly original and ingeniously integrated. The story commits fully to its premise, synthesizing it with the specific, grounded elements of the prison library and the coffee tin to create a fresh, memorable perspective. The final reconfiguration feels both surprising and inevitable, a hallmark of strong ingenuity.</comment>
