<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her spatial imagination trait, which constrains her actions. Her emotional progression feels authentic, with embodied contradictions like the ache in her chest matching the hushed thunder. The final choice to uncover secrets feels earned by prior causality, though the transition from discovery to resolve is slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—Mara's vow to find the love reconfigures the stakes. The accumulative/textural lens holds, layering sensory and emotional density. A minor causality slip occurs when the film's reveal feels slightly convenient, but it doesn't break closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The projection booth acts as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, like the dust and decayed film stock. The environment pressures Mara's actions, and the recurring film canister reweights meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens, deepening through psychometry revelations. The cost is legible when she gasps at the 1947 vision and her throat tightens at the unresolved grief. One meaningful tightening occurs as the vision shifts, narrowing her understanding of the unused love.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete image of unused love stored in artifacts. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—love waiting to be noticed—without moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like Elise's kiss on the envelope, and the concept integrates with Mara's quest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward memory lattices and sensory filtering. Diction remains within Mara's lexicon, and rhythmic control holds under pressure. The prose has a textured, lyrical quality that supports the accumulative drive without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied sentence rhythms and strong sensory verbs. Minor scaffold appears in phrases like "hushed thunder" repeated, but it doesn't obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, enhancing the atmosphere without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychometry, vintage cinema, and unused love feels fresh and inevitable. Specific details like the smoky quartz sphere and frayed sprocket holes anchor the premise. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry, and the closure image is charged.</comment>
