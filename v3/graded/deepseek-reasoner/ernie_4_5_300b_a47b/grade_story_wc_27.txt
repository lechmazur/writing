<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is strong, with her awkward confidence and stargazer nature compelling her to act. Her final choice to use the stones is earned by her prior established pattern of accurate predictions. A minor deduction for the trait "awkwardly confident" being more told than shown in its constraint on choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal, held consistently. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the rebellion's spirit is reignited, landing with clear cost in the final image of the roaring crowd. The linkage from Lira's observation to Jax's involvement to the climax is tight and motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and actively pressures the narrative. The abandoned spaceport and ancient stone circle are not just backdrop; they constrain and enable the climax, with the stones' hum being the essential mechanism for the story's decisive turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the causal lens, moving from observation to persuasion to action. The stakes (a stalled rebellion finding meaning) are clear and tighten convincingly. The cost is the risk of failure and the tangible shift in the rebels' morale, felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of finding meaning in chaos emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the stones and the rebellion's lull. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The concept is fully integrated into the narrative's action and closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, slightly poetic narrative voice that fits Lira's character. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. A minor register drift in the phrase "thunderous serenity" slightly jars the established voice at the peak beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and propulsive with high information density. The phrase "thunderous serenity" presents a minor figurative muddle in a high-pressure beat, acting as a slight artifact that reduces clarity at a pivotal moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sci-fi rebellion with almost mystical archeo-astronomical elements feels fresh and specific. The concept is executed with confidence, though the central premise of a lull in rebellion is a familiar trope, albeit transformed here through the specific mechanism of the stones.</comment>
