<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his established eccentricity and past trauma. His final choice to return the memories is a credible renunciation that forecloses his path of isolation with a visible, felt cost. However, the concept of "borrowed memories" itself feels slightly under-dramatized in its mechanics, acting more as a thematic device than a fully embodied internal conflict for him.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elias shifts from investigator to restorer, accepting a new burden. The causal lens holds: the investigation leads logically to the discovery and his decisive choice. The cost is legible in his statement, "I’ve carried enough." The final image of a child's laughter waiting to be reclaimed effectively reconfigures the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and nautical twilight are not merely atmospheric but actively pressure the characters and charge the final image. The setting constrains discovery (the hidden hatch) and the environment's evolution (the lifting mist at dawn) mirrors the internal shift. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and fully integrated into the POV's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: Elias's investigation directly leads to the woman's revelation and the discovery of the trunk. The stakes tighten from curiosity to a profound moral imperative. The cost of his new burden is clear, though the pressure could have been slightly more visceral in the middle beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of carrying others' burdens emerges organically from the core concept and character actions, culminating in Elias's final, resonant realization: "isolation isn’t just about being alone... It’s about carrying what isn’t yours." This offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, slightly archaic quality that suits the lighthouse keeper's character and the melancholic tone. Dialogue is economical and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext. The POV is stable and the prose effectively reflects Elias's perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is generally strong, vivid, and purposeful, with a good rhythm. Minor artifacts are present, such as a slight over-reliance on figurative language in the opening ("bruise-purple sky," "slick with salt and mist that clung like cobwebs") which, while beautiful, slightly delays narrative momentum. The line-level craft is otherwise excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The combination of a lighthouse keeper, borrowed memories, and a maritime mystery feels fresh and specific. The core concept is intriguing and well-integrated, transforming familiar tropes through grounded, character-driven choices. The resolution feels earned and avoids cliché, though the concept's mechanics are more thematic than plot-driving.</comment>
