<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias’s grief and atonement are embodied and specific, driving his choices with visible cost (bleeding fingers, quiet certainty). His internal contradiction—altruism rooted in personal failure—is dramatized, not summarized. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, though the motivation's initial explanation ("not altruism but atonement") is slightly tell-y, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where grief is refracted, not diminished, with felt cost in the final image of the pendant. The pattern of stencil→lanterns→origami→light is taught early and pays off. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The observatory constrains and enables the ritual; the stencil and lanterns are tactile tools that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., "frayed" vellum, "cold stone floor"). The micro-setting is indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency under the accumulative lens: folding, adjusting, illuminating. The stakes (mending grief) deepen through a cadence shift into the ritual’s activation. Cost is legible in his physical effort and the transformation of his heart from hollow to "quiet, burning certainty."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central metaphor of "teaching withering to bloom again." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—grief as a language, light as refraction—without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like the shadows becoming "invitations."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature ("time pooled like mercury"). The voice modulates under pressure, retaining its poetic texture. Minor register drift in phrases like "genuinely artificial" feels slightly academic but is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, though figurative language occasionally stacks in high-pressure beats (e.g., "aglow with stars that moved like living things"). One minor paraphrase loop ("not a cure for grief, but a language for it") slightly dulls momentum but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of mourning jewelry, astronomical ritual, and origami is fresh and inevitable. The core concept ("curtains of intention") is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
