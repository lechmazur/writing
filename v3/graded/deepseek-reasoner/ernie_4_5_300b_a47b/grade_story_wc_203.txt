<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his trait of observant ghost-seeing. His micro-choices under pressure, like using the mainspring barrel and climbing to investigate the ceiling, reveal his values and drive the plot. The final endurance of the "weightless burden" of understanding is earned by prior causality with visible cost. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on his observational trait as a primary driver without deeper internal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal drive lens holds strongly, with each discovery leading logically to the next. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elias chooses to "repair the stories," foreclosing his own neutrality with the felt cost of the burden. The cost is legible in the final image of his tight chest and the ghosts' dissolution. Orientation is clear within the first 100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in micro-detail that constrains choice and charges the finale. The elevator shaft, dust patterns, and cracks in the ceiling are not just described but are the very mechanisms of discovery. The environment pressures Elias's actions, and the specific, sensory details ("cool metal," "peeling laminate") are filtered through his professional, observant POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, moving from observation to physical investigation to the climactic discovery. The stake (freeing the ghosts) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. The cost is visible in his "shaking legs" and the emotional weight he accepts. A minor deduction as the final choice to engage feels slightly inevitable given his established motive, lacking a sharper, more difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central concept of "cracks in the façade"—both physical and emotional—without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about repairing hidden stories. The integration of the circus tragedy and the family photograph deepens the thematic weight, avoiding sentimentality for a more complex, earned wisdom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, precise voice that reflects Elias's profession and sensitivity. The prose rhythm is controlled, and purposeful elision (e.g., the exact nature of the ghosts) is taught and paid off. A minor deduction for a occasional filter phrase ("he could feel them") that slightly dulls immediacy, though it is largely voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and vivid, with high information density and varied rhythm. Sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously ("The dust here was thicker, layered in years of neglect"). There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. The final image is sharp and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghost-seeing elevator repairman in an abandoned circus is highly original and feels organic, not a checklist. The core concept of "cracks" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the setting and plot. The risk-taking in blending the mundane and spectral heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
