<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation is clear and rooted in embodied pain ("the pain of forgetting gnawed deeper"). Her final choice to embrace her truth is earned by the climactic vision and the cost of the shards embedding in her skin. A slight deduction for the transformation feeling somewhat swift, though the groundwork of her struggle is present.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lirael redefines home through the act of remembering, with a clear on-page cost ("Pain lanced through her"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory and memory density to a decisive cadence shift. The linkage from intention to seeding to vision is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a character; the labyrinthine bookstore and crystalline cavern actively constrain and enable Lirael's choices. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful (e.g., "dust motes swirled like tiny galaxies"). The feather and stone are micro-settings that charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lirael's agency under the Accumulative lens—her decision to use the feather intensifies the pressure, leading to the vision and her transformative choice. The cost is legible in the shattering stone and embedded shards. A minor deduction as the external pressure (falling rocks) feels briefly convenient but is quickly subsumed by her action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict, culminating in the resonant, non-literal answer: "Home isn't a place... but the shape of what you carry." The concept of memory as both burden and home is earned through Lirael's struggle, avoiding moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice that filters the world through Lirael's unique perspective. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with pressure. A slight deduction for a few moments of elevated diction ("stardust") that slightly strain the POV's immediacy in peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythmic control. Minor figurative muddle in one peak beat ("swirling into stardust" slightly clashes with the physical logic of the feather's dissolution). Otherwise, high information density and clear propulsion with no significant loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mercury-glass seer, a memory-storing stone, and a labyrinthine bookstore is fresh and specific. The core concept feels inevitable in hindsight, and the risk of a lyrical, internal climax pays off with a coherent and charged closure image.</comment>
