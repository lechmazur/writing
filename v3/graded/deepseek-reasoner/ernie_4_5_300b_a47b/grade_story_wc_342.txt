<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira's face-blindness is a specific, embodied trait that filters her perception ("memorized souls through textures and hues") and motivates her discovery. Her final choice to paint the stars is a credible renunciation of her original commission, earned by her tactile connection to the tree and the journal's revelation. A minor deduction for the coin's backstory feeling slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized in the present moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through sensory density and the impending demolition. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lira's act of preservation redefines the guild's legacy and her own limits. The cost is legible in the final image of the portrait "shimmering" as the tree falls. The coin's introduction is the only minor strain on causality, but it is quickly integrated into the pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is a masterful micro-setting that actively constrains and enables the entire plot. Sensory details are purposefully selective and filtered through Lira's professional POV ("damp bark," "smelled of wet soil and old parchment"). The environment's tactile nature is indispensable, directly leading to the discovery and shaping the final, charged image of the painting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens, tightening via the external pressure of the demolition crew's arrival. Lira's agency shifts from observation to decisive action (discovery, painting, escape), foreclosing her original path. The cost is the literal destruction of the library, making her preservation act necessary and poignant. A slight deduction as the crew's threat remains somewhat off-stage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of preservation vs. destruction emerges organically from Lira's actions and the journal's message ("let the stars remain"). The final image answers the central question non-literally, reweighting the value of legacy. Subtext is rich in the contrast between the guild's carved knowledge and Lira's painted sky. Avoids moralizing, landing on a resonant, conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lira's tactile, face-blind perception, creating a distinct perceptual signature. The prose's rhythm modulates effectively with the rising pressure. The single line of dialogue is effectively summarized, avoiding on-page tags. Elision (e.g., the guild member's mutterings) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally clean, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language is precise and pattern-driven ("fractally precise spirals"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level rhythm supports the accumulating stillness and subsequent chaos. Read-aloud quality is high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of a face-blind artist, a tree library, and celestial cartography. The core concept feels inevitable in hindsight, not a checklist. The specific, lived detail (textures, pigments, the coin's indentations) creates authentic freshness. Bold risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure pays off with a powerful closure image.</comment>
