<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Kael's characterization is deeply integrated with his role; his micro-choices under pressure (e.g., closing his eyes to drift into dreams) reveal a hierarchy of values. His final decision to weave truth into dreams is earned by prior causality, with the cost felt in the emotional weight of the revelations. Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, with dream fragments deepening emotional stakes coherently. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kael places the globe, reweighting connections with undeniable cost on the page ("the fragile, enduring threads"). Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the pattern is taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and melted snow globe are vivid, purposeful, and constrain choices—the globe charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Kael's professional bias (e.g., "the ice thinned and the dead spoke"). Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting evolves with the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the accumulative lens, with each dream deepening the emotional stakes and narrowing his options. The cost is legible in the aching revelations of the widow and son. However, the pressure feels slightly abstracted in the dream sequences, lacking a tangible, immediate threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection emerges organically through the snow globe's evolving meaning and the dream revelations, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "threads of connection," reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature that modulates under pressure. The prose rhythm supports the accumulative structure, and any elision (e.g., dream transitions) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet propulsive, with varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Figurative language ("flickering shadows that danced like ghosts") is pattern-taught and enhances atmosphere. Minor ornamentation in phrases like "borrowed starlight" slightly inflates texture but doesn't obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The concept of a wreck-diver using a melted snow globe to analyze dreams is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. Risks in structure (dream fragments) heighten stakes without gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity anchors the universal theme.</comment>
