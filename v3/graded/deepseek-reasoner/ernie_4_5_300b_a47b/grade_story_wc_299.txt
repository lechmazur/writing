<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("the hollow space where purpose used to live"). The final choice to resurrect stories feels earned by his prior insulation and the cloth's discovery. A slight deduction for the "confidently uncertain" label feeling slightly tell-y, though it is dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) as Lenny finds purpose in resurrecting stories, a decisive change from his retreat. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building meaning through layered details. The cost is legible in the final image of the talisman and fading blasts. The Google search is a minor causality convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("the trailer smelled of mildew and regret"). The quarry office trailer and the speaker cloth function as micro-settings that pressure choices and charge the final image. The environment subtly mirrors Lenny's internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering purpose) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: finding the cloth, resisting Gus, researching, and calling the bassist. The cost is the foreclosed path of mere appraisal, made legible in the final beat. A single meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges coherently from events and images, exploring what remains "after the applause." The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the talisman and the realization about resurrecting stories. It embraces complexity without a tidy moral, though the core concept is occasionally echoed a bit directly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and effective, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose has a distinct texture, and diction remains within Lenny's plausible lexicon. The brief dialogue with Gus is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext and advancing the plot.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is clear and concise with strong momentum and high information density. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, varying with scene needs. Read-aloud rhythm is strong. A very minor instance of near-paraphrase ("appraisal manuals to deflect grief" / "using trivia to fill the silence") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ex-roadie appraiser and a speaker cloth relic feels organic and fresh. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on failure and purpose. Emotional truth and specificity avoid generic templates, though the concept of "after the applause" is a recognizable trope transformed through grounded detail.</comment>
