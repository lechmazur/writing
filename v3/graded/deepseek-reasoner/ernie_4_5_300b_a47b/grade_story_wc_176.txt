<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in specific trauma (workshop fire, loss of voice), with embodied emotion ("hands raw but steady") and micro-choices under pressure. The final endurance/renunciation feels earned, though the "technically gentle" descriptor slightly distances the emotional peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Lira's appearance) with undeniable cost (illuminated names, raw hands). Orientation is immediate; the rope's mechanism is taught early and pays off at closure with coherent pattern-break escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and aurora pressure choices (frosted mechanism, creaking ice) and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("air tasted of snowmelt and iron"), with the rope and card constraining tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the accumulative lens (weaving threads, inserting card), with cost legible in raw hands and illuminated names. One meaningful tightening (rope's reconfiguration) forecloses other paths with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory preservation emerges organically through concrete particulars (punched card, rope braids). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lira's apparition and the glowing names, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("glacial stone that glowed faintly"). Lyric compression is taught and paid off. Minor register drift in "technically gentle" slightly disrupts voice consistency at peak emotion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythm, though slight overwriting occurs in stacked modifiers ("green-gold veils," "clear and aching"). No loops or scaffold artifacts; closure clarity is untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of memory, craft, and mysticism feels inevitable. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The punched card and ceremonial rope are irreplaceable specifics.</comment>
