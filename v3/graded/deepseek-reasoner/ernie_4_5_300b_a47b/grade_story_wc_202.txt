<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotion and a credible final endurance. However, her internal contradiction under pressure is more summarized than dramatized in the peak beat, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a clear, felt cost ("a comfort, a reminder") that reweights the premise through the final image of the lighthouse beam.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The market is vividly rendered and pressures choice, and the recurring lighthouse image charges the final beat. A slight over-reliance on visual description in the opening prevents a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens, using the ink to perceive patterns. A single, meaningful deepening occurs, and the cost of the reclaimed memory is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of honoring overlooked histories emerges organically from the specific action of retrieving the fragment. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, perceptive signature. The patterned elision of the market's dissolution is taught and paid off, contributing to the closure's lyrical quality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly poetic and dense, but a tendency toward stacked modifiers ("translucent silk and iron lattices that hummed with trapped light") creates minor momentum drag in the opening, though clarity is maintained at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of an alchemist's market, a between-worlds translator, and intuition-based problem-solving feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with high specificity.</comment>
