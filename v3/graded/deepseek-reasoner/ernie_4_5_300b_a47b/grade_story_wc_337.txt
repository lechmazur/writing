<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure ("she began to work faster"). Her motivation to escape her past and mend broken things is clear and intensifies. The final realization is slightly told ("she felt… lucid") rather than fully dramatized, but the choice to listen is earned by the net's unraveling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara shifts from mending to listening, with cost legible in the lifted weight from her chest. The unraveling accumulates pressure through a single, decisive cadence shift. The linkage from the interlaced hush to the final hum is coherent and taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and starlight are vividly rendered and purposefully selective. The net and needle function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. However, the broader setting's pressure on choices is more atmospheric than tactical, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency in unraveling the net, a meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens. The dominant stake (grounding spirits) is tested, and the cost of the released hush is felt. The pressure coheres, though the final cost is more conceptual than viscerally concrete on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the net and Mara's role. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about silence versus listening. The final lines ("ready to listen") verge on thematic statement but are anchored in the earned image of the key and the hum, avoiding overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature ("accumulated silence"). The prose rhythm is controlled, and the dialogue is natural and goal-driven. The elision of the net's specific mechanics is purposeful and paid off in the closure's conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("knots tight as forgotten secrets"). No significant loops, scaffolds, or artifacts were detected. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, accelerating with the unraveling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise of a broken mask restorer in a prism sanctuary is a fresh, specific synthesis. The concept of "interlaced hush" is transformed through grounded, particular execution. The risk-taking with a quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
