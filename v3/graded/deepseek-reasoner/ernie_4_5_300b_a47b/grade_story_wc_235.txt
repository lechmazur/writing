<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied ("a feral nostalgia that clawed at my ribs"). The final choice to climb is motivated by the scroll's discovery and a credible, character-specific internal conflict. A minor deduction for the diagnostic-sounding "chronologically confused," though it is quickly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a clear, felt cost: the bittersweet clarity that reconfigures his relationship to the past. The final image of "soaring, stumbling step" lands with undeniable conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("snow crunched beneath my boots"). The mountain and cabin effectively establish tone and pressure. Capped at 8.8 as the environment, while atmospheric, does not decisively constrain a key choice or charge the final image beyond its established tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: the discovery of the scroll and the decision to climb. The cost is legible in the physical struggle of the climb and the emotional price of confronting past selves, culminating in the final, resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of reconciling with one's past emerges organically from the grave, the scroll, and the climb. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("I was *building* it, brick by brick") that reweights the prior material without moralizing. Exceptional integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent, lyrical perceptual signature. The voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity. Purposeful elision (e.g., not remembering writing the scroll) is taught and pays off, serving the theme and character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated. A single minor paraphrase loop exists ("I laughed, though it was a hollow sound") but does not obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core premise of a lucid dream chronicler finding his grave is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotionally complex conclusion, avoiding template plots or generic resolutions.</comment>
