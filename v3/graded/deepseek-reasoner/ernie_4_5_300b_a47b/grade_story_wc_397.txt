<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila's numbness and motivation are concrete and embodied, driving her to the marina and compelling her to act during the rescue. Her internal state is shown through specific, contradictory impulses, like welcoming physical pain. The final flicker of peace is earned by her actions, though the initial euthanasia tourist premise feels slightly underutilized in the final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) with clear cost: her purposeful action to rescue the scientist reconfigures her stance from passive numbness to active engagement, culminating in a felt moment of peace. The causal lens holds strongly from her state to her actions to the sound and the rescue. The final image of her sitting with the parasol tip charges the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is a masterfully rendered environment that actively pressures choices and constrains action. The cold seeps through boots, the ice requires picks to break, and the fissure from which the boat is hauled is a tangible, dangerous feature. The setting is integral, not decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: Lila actively chooses to investigate the sound and then to use her parasol tip to hook the boat, a decisive act that narrows options and forces the rescue. The cost is the physical exertion and the emotional shift away from her planned purpose, which is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of finding purpose through action instead of seeking an ending emerges organically from the events. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The concept of the "fold in patience" is slightly under-developed as a thematic anchor, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Lila's perception. The prose has a distinct, controlled texture with a rhythmic cadence that modulates with emotional intensity ("a detachment so profound it felt like standing outside her own life"). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. "The fold in patience, she’d come to think of it, was the space between action and acceptance" is a standout line of precise, evocative compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of euthanasia tourism with arctic disaster relief is a fresh, non-obvious angle. The specific use of the parasol tip as a tool is a memorable inflection. The premise is transformed through grounded character choices, though the euthanasia concept itself is not fully explored in the climax, limiting its risk-taking impact.</comment>
