<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is exceptionally concrete, with her driftwood sculptures and "perpetually learning brain" shaping her actions under pressure. Her final role reconfiguration from sculptor to timeline weaver feels earned through prior causality, with visible cost in abandoned art. Embodied emotion ("tasting like salt and iron") avoids diagnostic speech. Minor deduction for slightly tidy emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pattern density increasing through lantern slide and sculpture revelations. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image reweights prior motifs with undeniable cost—abandoned sculptures now hold new meaning. Orientation is clear within 120 words. No causality breaks; all turns arise from established elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the archway and storm constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is purposefully selective ("damp moss," "bruised sky") and filtered through Lira's professional perspective. The archway functions as both environment and micro-setting, actively shaping tactics. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's agency under the accumulative lens—her decision to press the slide triggers the key turning point. Dominant stake (understanding the island's history) tightens through pattern recognition rather than causal turns. Cost is legible when her sculptures are abandoned, though slightly less visceral than ideal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through recurring images (sculptures, slides) that shift meaning at closure without moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to complexity vs. simplicity through the transformed sculptures. Avoids thematic echo; wisdom arises from concrete particulars ("kelp hair as timeline").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature ("groaning like a creature between worlds"). Voice modulates purposefully under pressure, though minor register drift occurs in "turbine-hum reverie." Elision (time transition) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping; internal voice remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor artifact: "turbine-hum reverie" introduces slight register drift in a peak beat. Otherwise, sentences advance story without loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time travel and artisanal craftsmanship feels fresh and inevitable. Core concept ("timewoven alliances") is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative template echoes.</comment>
