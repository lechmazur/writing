<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara's obsession is embodied through concrete actions like tracing cracks and resisting distractions. Her final choice to accept the map's imperfection ("Let it be a living thing") feels earned by prior causality. Micro-choices under pressure reveal a clear hierarchy of values. The only minor flaw is a slight diagnostic tinge in "silence was not empty but layered," though it's quickly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure deepens through layered silences, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the map illuminates the darkness. Cost is legible in her trembling smile and the shedding flakes. Orientation is immediate and functional. The closure lands with undeniable conceptual weight, though the cost could be slightly more visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The fort and booklet are indispensable constraints, shaping every tactical choice. The environment actively pressures Mara ("walls groaned," "shower of pebbles"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her expertise. The final image is charged by the setting's transformation under the map's light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens: each summarized silence deepens the stakes. The dominant stake (mapping the night) tightens through her endurance against environmental resistance. Cost is visible in her aching fingers and the booklet's physical decay. One meaningful intensification is sufficient, though the pressure could compound more sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of mapping silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of absence/presence. Subtext operates in imagery ("ghosts of old battles," "stolen starlight"). Avoids moralizing; the final image reweights prior material without declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by her expertise. Diction ("ambered hush," "marbled hush") is consistent and voice-motivated. Purposeful compression ("retell the silence") is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures that mirror tension. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful ("stone teeth gnawing at the wind"). No loops, scaffold, or artifacting. Minor overload in "ambered hush" and "marbled hush" slightly risks pattern fatigue but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The concept of mapping silence through summarized absences is highly original and fully integrated. Synthesis of oracle, fort, and oceanic imagery feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical abstraction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
