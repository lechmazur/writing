<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s characterization is strong, with clear, consistent motivation rooted in her con-artist upbringing ("Trust the math, kid"). Her internal conflict is embodied in her choice to act, and her final decision to trade the scroll for asylum is a high-stakes micro-choice that reveals her values. A minor deduction for the ink's effect granting near-telepathic insight, which slightly simplifies the complexity of reading opponents under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal drive lens is clear and holds. Closure is a decisive change (asylum secured) with a resonant reconfiguration in the final line, which reweights the premise of faking death. The cost—her father's location and the scroll—is traded on the page. The dummy in the casket is a well-set-up payoff that lands the turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prep room is vividly anchored with sensory detail (lilies, ironed linen, mahogany) and functions as a micro-setting that enables hiding. However, it does not actively constrain choices or charge the final image to a higher degree; the agents and casket are props within it rather than products of it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (asylum, father's safety, exposing corruption) are clearly signaled. Escalation is driven by Elara's agency: she chooses to reveal herself and negotiate. The cost of revealing her father's location and the formula is legible. The tension coheres and tightens convincingly under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between rigid systems (corruption) and fluid thinking (the ink). The final image of "mathematics of a fair trade" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of equity versus control, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single, stable POV with a distinct perceptual signature. Elara's voice is consistent and her knowledge stays character-bound. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, particularly Mr. Harrow's interjection which highlights the absurdity of the negotiation venue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with vivid imagery ("scent of lilies and the echo of a con artist’s honest child"). A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the line "liquefying rigid thinking," which feels more academic than the surrounding voice, and a template cadence in "She waited, counting the seconds...".</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The combination of a con artist's child, a magical-realist ink pot, and high-stakes economic conspiracy feels fresh and specific. The concept is fully committed to and transformed through the particulars of Elara's character and the funeral home setting, avoiding cliché.</comment>
