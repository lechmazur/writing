<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's characterization is exceptional, with her blindness integrated as a genuine constraint that shapes her perception and methods. Her micro-choices under pressure—using the water basin, trusting Marlow's guidance—reveal a clear hierarchy of values focused on precision and listening. The final choice to recalibrate the servo is earned by prior causality, and her quiet endurance is a credible, earned stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds firmly. The inciting incident (HB-7's fracture) triggers a clear because/therefore chain: the fracture necessitates the basin diagnosis, which reveals the servo misalignment, forcing the recalibration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Lira's skill is affirmed, foreclosing the path of doubt with the visible cost of perpetual work. Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in purposeful, POV-filtered detail. The mist, depot, and anchor lift create palpable atmosphere, but the basin of water is the standout micro-setting. It is not just described; it actively constrains Lira's choice and methodology, and its properties are essential to diagnosing and solving the core problem, directly charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is tightly driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens. The stake (a successful maiden voyage) is signaled early. The malfunction forces a diagnostic choice (using the basin), which deepens the problem (servo misalignment), necessitating a higher-stakes tactical choice (recalibration). The cost is the relentless, endless nature of the work, felt in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of character and method: seeing by listening, finding clarity in refraction. The core concept of repair is inextricable from Lira's internal state. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of mending the invisible, avoiding moralizing and resting on earned particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lira's perceptual signature—"seeing" through touch, vibration, and refracted light. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the calm intensity of her work. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven, with distinct idiolects for Lira's introspection and Marlow's gruff mentorship.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, specific imagery. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight synonym churn ("mist clung," "blurring the edges") in the opener and a faint template cadence in "She carried... She dipped... She traced." However, these do not obscure causality or dull the closure, and information density remains high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a blind artisan, hummingbird drones, and light refraction diagnostics feels fresh and inevitable. The concept is fully committed to and followed through with integrity, transforming familiar tropes (the gifted mechanic) through specific, grounded choices in character and method. The risk of a quiet, stasis-based ending pays off.</comment>
