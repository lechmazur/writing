<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under the pressure of the time constraint. Her micro-choices, like choosing the left tunnel, reveal a character-specific intuition. The final transformation into a "keeper of thresholds" is an earned stance crystallization, though the internal contradiction during the peak pressure moment could be slightly more embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lira's role and understanding are fundamentally reweighted. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through sensory density and the live clock. The cost is legible in the final image of the key as a "promise," charging her new purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The grotto is a masterclass in micro-setting, actively pressuring choices through its twisting layout, low ceilings, and the "clandestinely luminous" walls. The environment is not a backdrop but a crucial actor, constraining movement and directly enabling the discovery of the key, which charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive cadence shift—the gravity inversion—that reweights the dominant stake and forces a new tactical approach. The live clock provides coherent pressure, and Lira's agency in tracing the doodle to trigger the event is clear. The cost is the foreclosing of her old life as a "mere archivist."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of finding profound meaning in overlooked margins is fully integrated, emerging from the specific action of tracing a margin doodle to unlock a world-altering secret. The final image of the key offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing, reweighting the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture with a controlled perceptual signature ("prism-minded," "kaleidoscope of overlapping timelines"). The voice is consistent and effectively modulated, though a slight over-reliance on complex compound adjectives creates minor rhythmic density in a few spots.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor deduction for a subtle paraphrase loop ("seeds of vigilance" and "faint sparks of awareness" in the first paragraph) and a single instance of a slightly mixed metaphor ("its teeth biting into her palm like a promise").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of an archivist, a gravity-inverting grotto, and mystical margin doodles is highly original and feels organic. The core concept is committed to fully, and the specific, grounded details prevent it from feeling like a template. The final reconfiguration is both fresh and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
