<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira's contradictory impulses—control vs. witness—are dramatized through micro-choices with the rocks. Her final renunciation is earned by the fracturing visions, and the cost of her endurance is felt in the "tears mingling with the salt spray." A hairline deduction for the slightly abstract "precognitive gift" label.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through pattern density (Fibonacci, Pascal, Möbius) until a cadence shift at the climax reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear cost: the foreclosed path of control is visible in the surrendered star dust and the accepted role of witness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tidal bluff and aurora are not backdrop; they supply the key resources (still water, light) and constraints (no friction) that dictate Lira's tactics. The environment charges the final image, with the eels' bodies forming a "living sigil" under the shifting light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lira's sequenced attempts, each narrowing her options under the accumulative lens. The cost is legible in the blinding star dust and the terror of the "howling void" vision, forcing her final, costly stance shift from control to witness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme emerges impeccably from the concrete struggle with the rocks and eels, culminating in the non-literal, earned realization that patterns are "a language to honor" rather than a puzzle to solve. The final image answers the central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lira's professional and emotional lens. The voice is distinct and rhythmic, though a slight register drift occurs in the peak beat ("screamed," "blinding") which, while voice-motivated, creates a minor tonal jar.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and sensory selection. A minor deduction for a potentially mixed metaphor ("knot" of promise) and the clustered intensity of "star dust screamed, its light blinding" in the high-pressure beat, which slightly risks clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial magic, mathematical patterning, and a precognitive curse feels fresh and organic. The core concept is fully committed to, and the final inflection—shifting from control to witness—is a specific, non-obvious, and inevitable transformation of the premise.</comment>
