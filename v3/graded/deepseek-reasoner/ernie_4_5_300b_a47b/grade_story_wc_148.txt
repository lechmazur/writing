<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in specific trauma ("his father’s ghost," "cried wolf"). His internal conflict is embodied through tactile interaction with the lattice and credible emotional degradation under stress. The final choice to "write" rather than run is a credible Earned Stasis, though the moment of cost payment is slightly oblique.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory density and pattern breaks (lattice blooming, walls shifting). Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias lands in the chamber and chooses to write his truth. The cost is felt in the final image of the stone bleeding and the "bodies waiting," making the reconfiguration undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison is a masterclass in micro-setting, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The lattice is a tool that evolves in use and meaning, the copperlight modulates with pressure, and the spatial choreography is coherent and purposeful. The environment is inseparable from the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive cadence shift (lattice blooming, hovering) that reweights the dominant stake of self-definition. The protagonist's agency in placing his lattice beside his father's is the key tightening choice, forcing a trade-off and foreclosing the path of mere chase. The cost is legible in the transformed passage and the waiting bodies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict between inherited lies and self-authored truth. The lattice as pen and labyrinth as page is a fresh, non-literal synthesis that avoids moralizing. The final image offers a resonant answer through particulars—writing over running—that reweights prior material without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature ("copperlight repose," "sound like wind through a keyhole"). Purposeful compression and patterned diction ("chasing the hush") are taught early and paid off at closure. POV is stable and the elision of the figure's identity serves the ending's ambiguity effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. There is minor overwriting in a high-pressure beat ("a lullaby of deceit," "a mosaic of memory and myth") that slightly mutes the immediacy of the father's ghost confrontation, but it does not harm closure clarity. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The story presents a highly original synthesis of familiar elements (ghost, labyrinth, lighthouse) through a specific, voice-driven lens. The concept of "chasing the hush" is a fresh, non-obvious angle that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and dense prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
