<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, driving high-stakes choices. Her "brightly attentive" trait is embodied in her focused work, though her internal conflict could be more contradictory in-scene. The final resolve feels earned by prior causality, with a visible cost in her flight from security.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (escape) with cost under a causal lens. The because/therefore linkage is strong, from discovering the video to pinpointing the coordinates. The orientation is clear early, and the ending's cost is legible in her flight and resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The social network archive is a functional, pressure-filled setting that constrains choice (e.g., restricted files, security drones). The patch is a key recurring object that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though more could be filtered through Lira's urgent POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through Lira's agency under the causal lens. Pressure tightens meaningfully with the video discovery and security response, forcing a decisive choice. The cost of her flight is legible, though the confrontation with Hale could have more immediate tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of erasure and memory emerges through events (deleted files, cover-up) rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lira's resolve. However, it leans slightly toward declared thematic stakes ("make sure the world remembered") rather than fully emerging from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a controlled, tech-inflected rhythm. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Hale's lie). Some prose leans slightly generic ("heart raced," "fingers trembled"), but elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with good information density. Minor scaffold phrases appear ("her eyes brightly attentive," "pulse quickening"), and a few metaphors feel slightly mixed ("sea of data streams," "echo of forgotten songs"). No major artifacts harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of corporate memory keeper and cosmic mystery feels fresh and organic. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices in the digital archive setting. The climax arises from established pattern (recurring numbers), though the core premise is a recognizable investigative template.</comment>
