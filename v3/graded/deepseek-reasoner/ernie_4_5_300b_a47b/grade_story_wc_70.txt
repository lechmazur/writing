<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clara's involuntary candor is a consistent, well-established trait that motivates her final public declaration, a credible micro-choice under pressure. Her emotional progression from burdened keeper to hopeful advocate is earned, though her internal conflict could be more contradictory in the moment of choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Clara chooses to weaponize her candor, foreclosing her previous isolation with a visible cost of social risk. The causal lens holds: the blackout and drone failure lead to Voss's reveal, which directly motivates her public action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lightning tower is a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image; its faint glow and copper cables are woven into the action. Sensory details like "boots crunching gravel" and "nectar dusk" are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Clara's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restoring power/wonder) is clear. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Clara's discovery of the drones and choice to open the box. The cost of the city's disbelief is legible, though the middle beat with Voss slightly diminishes her agency in the initial discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of wonder vs. routine emerges organically from the tower's mechanics and Clara's arc, culminating in the resonant, non-literal final image of the "spark" and golden light. It avoids moralizing, answering its central question through the child's widened eyes and the rekindled drone activity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, controlled texture with a strong perceptual signature ("nectar dusk," "tastes like regret"). POV is stable and voice is consistent, even under pressure. The dialogue with Voss is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext about the system's failure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional. Prose is concise, vivid, and propulsive with high information density ("the air hummed with a restless energy"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Rhythm varies effectively, and the final sentence lands with perfect cadence and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a energy-harvesting tower running on collective awe is a fresh, non-obvious concept. The integration feels organic, though the core mechanism (drones pollinating doubt) leans slightly toward conceptual convenience rather than being fully grounded in the world's lived-in logic.</comment>
