<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marin's insomnia and artistic struggle are embodied and drive micro-choices; her wry earnestness is a consistent trait. The final choice to use the brooch is motivated by her established pursuit of meaning, though the immediate trust of the stranger feels slightly convenient. The cost of her exchanged canvas is felt, earning her resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing) via the final painted image and note, reweighting loss as renewal. The cost is legible in the transformed canvas and eased insomnia. Causality is tight, with the brooch's introduction and use creating a decisive, earned shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tidal island is a pressurized, active environment that constrains choice (the rain leads her, the brooch is found in silt). Specific, sensory details like "salt-bleached cliffs" and "mud that smelled of iron and decay" are filtered through Marin's POV. The lighthouse studio and brooch charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes (finding meaning) are signaled early. Escalation is accumulative, driven by Marin's agency in following the rain and accepting the exchange. The cost of the traded canvas is visible, and the final choice to use the brooch meaningfully deepens and reconfigures her options, charging the closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars (brooch, paintings, rain) rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("Meaning isn’t threshed. It’s grown") that reweights prior loss without moralizing. The final image of the island as a bridge provides conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive quality ("brushes dipped in starlight"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Minor register drift occurs with the phrase "threshing meaning," which feels slightly abstract for the voice, but overall control is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("wryly earnest," "haggard awe") and the phrase "threshing meaning" which leans abstract. However, information density is high and momentum is maintained, with no clarity issues at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-apocalyptic setting with a lyrical, character-driven quest feels fresh and organic. The core concept of "drowned possibilities" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the brooch and the exchange. The resolution feels earned and inevitable, heightening stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
