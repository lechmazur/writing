<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, rooted in trauma and a desire for authentic discovery. His affectionate skepticism is embodied in his interactions with Mara and his reverence for the geode. The final choice to persevere feels earned by his prior struggle, though a minor deduction for the slightly tidy emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (DC) with visible cost: Elias's breakthrough and Mara's mirrored hope. The causal lens holds strongly, with the static shock and geode providing a clear "because/therefore" linkage. The persistent constraint of the shock's somatic markers shapes tactics and the final, triumphant image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The light-painting studio and the geode sliver are not just described but function as micro-settings that actively constrain and enable choice. The geode's structure is the literal template for Elias's system, and the studio's tools are integral to his process. Sensory details like ozone and acrylic are purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens. The dominant stake (finding a real alternative to the pills) tightens through his experiments, culminating in the breakthrough where the geode aligns with his neural pathways. The cost is his week of intense, solitary work and the risk of failure, legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between engineered shortcuts and organic, hard-won discovery. The geode and the static shock are concrete particulars that resist abstraction. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of intertwined light and bone, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, analytical voice that fits Elias's character. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext in the exchange with Mara. A minor deduction for a slight convergence in the characters' hopeful diction at the very end, though the internal voice remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density. However, minor artifacting is present, including a template cadence in the description of the geode's facets and a slight register drift in phrases like "fractally, somatically, undeniably real," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's peak moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of neuro-tech, geology, and somatic experience feels fresh and specific. The core concept is fully committed to and its implications are followed through with conceptual integrity. The geode as a tool for mapping consciousness is a non-obvious, ingenious angle that is transformed through grounded, particular detail.</comment>
