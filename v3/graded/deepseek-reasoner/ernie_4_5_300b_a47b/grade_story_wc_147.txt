<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling her to release the memories rather than trap them. Her internal conflict is shown in scene ("override the urge to act"), and her final choice to let go is earned by the priests' revealed folly. A slight deduction for the abstract "jailer" metaphor in a peak beat, which feels slightly diagnostic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the temple's purpose is redefined from a vault to a prison, and Mara's act of release reconfigures the meaning of "harnessing the ephemeral." The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density and culminating in the unsnarling of voices. The cost is legible in the "thousand voices crying out at once."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater temple is a masterclass in micro-setting, constantly pressuring choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("algae-slick stone," "pressure squeezing her ribs"). The vial and the pedestal are key objects that constrain action and shape the climax. The environment is inextricable from the conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the "gathered hush" thickening and the vial's warmth signaling a decisive turn. The cost is unmistakable as the unsnarled voices pierce her soul. The stakes transform from personal discovery to a moral imperative to release the trapped grief, a meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of release versus preservation emerges organically from the climax, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The final image of the "empty but radiant" vial perfectly encapsulates the "lonesome splendor" of letting go. Subtext operates powerfully in the temple acting as a "mirror" and the redefined purpose of the vial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature ("pulsed with the whispers of drowned civilizations"). The prose has a controlled, lyrical rhythm that modulates with the pressure. Purposeful compression is used effectively, and the voice remains coherent and specific throughout the emotional peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and economical, with excellent rhythmic control and information density. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the peak beat ("jailer" feels slightly abstract for the POV's lexicon). Otherwise, the language is precise and propulsive, with no loops or scaffolding to obscure the powerful closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a memory-touching object, an underwater temple, and the concept of a "gathered hush" is fresh and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the climax, committing fully to the implications of its own logic. The final reconfiguration is both ingenious and emotionally truthful.</comment>
