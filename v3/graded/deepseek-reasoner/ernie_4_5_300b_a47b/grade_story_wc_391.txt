<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with his impatience and growth dramatized through concrete actions like the failed first attempt and his subsequent reset. His final choice to guide the moon's light is earned by prior causality, and the cost of his tiredness is felt. The trait "softly purposeful" evolves from an echo to a lived reality, visible in his steady hands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure building through the density of sensory detail and Kael's repeated, patient adjustments. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Kael internalizes the revolution's ethos, with cost legible in his fatigue and the viaduct's new, soothing hum. The orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake are not mere backdrop; they actively constrain and enable Kael's choices, from the viaduct's louder hum in the cold to the ice thickening into a "glassy sheet." The environment charges the final image, its evolution mirroring Kael's internal shift from impatience to purposeful alignment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven entirely by Kael's agency under the accumulative lens, his failed attempt raising the cost of haste and his subsequent patience enabling success. The dominant stake of unyoking power is tested on-page, and the cost is visible in his aching back and the tangible, controlled surge of energy he finally achieves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of sculpting patience from impatience is fully integrated, emerging from the specific, grounded action of tracking moon paths and the viaduct's recalcitrant energy. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the viaduct's lullaby, reweighting the prior struggle without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Kael's professional, perceptive consciousness. The voice has a distinct, lyrical texture with a controlled rhythm that modulates with the scene's pressure. The sparse dialogue is natural and serves to deepen the theme.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a single, minor instance of potential scaffold in "not in fear, but in anticipation," but it is a hairline slip that does not obscure clarity or momentum. Figurative language is precise and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The combination of a "vigilant horizon mapper" and a "magnetic viaduct" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels organic and inevitable. The core concept of a "patient revolution" is transformed from an abstract theme into the story's driving mechanical and philosophical engine, a significant risk that pays off.</comment>
