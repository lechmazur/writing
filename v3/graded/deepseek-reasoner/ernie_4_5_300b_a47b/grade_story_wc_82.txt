<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lantern maker's grief is embodied and contradictory ("her heart a knot of ache and awe"), driving micro-choices like polishing the gem until it weeps. Her final stance transformation—confronting the shadow—is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the "luminous torment" of reliving her brother's memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of descending/ascending intensifies through image density, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she holds the lantern to the shadow. Cost is legible in the "brittle" laugh and the agonizing beauty of the recorded dream.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glass basilica constrains choice (its descent/ascent mirrors her method), and the floating island tea garden charges the final image as ascending stars descend. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through her expertise ("lavender smoke and regret").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens: polishing the gem deepens the stakes, and her decision to confront the shadow reweights the conflict. Cost is felt in the "luminous torment" and the shadow's dissolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars (origami cranes, lanterns) and the final image of folding grief into flight. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to transformation without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled rhythmic prose ("a sound brittle as winter ice"). POV is stable and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression in high-pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density and vivid imagery, though minor strain in "luminous torment" slightly muddles clarity at peak beat. No loops or scaffolding; prose propels momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of grief and magic, with specific, irreplaceable elements (glass basilica, dream recording). Risk-taking in structure (descending/ascending paradox) heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
