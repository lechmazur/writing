<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and rooted in grief, compelling her choices. Her internal conflict between hiding and seeking is embodied in micro-choices, like hesitating at the book. The final endurance (staying) is earned, though her "keen empathy" trait is more told than shown constraining action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is an Earned Stasis as Eleanor chooses to stay, with cost felt in her tears and the reconfigured meaning of "hiding." Orientation is clear by ~120 words. The map and key provide a coherent, taught pattern that pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The library setting is vividly rendered and actively pressures choices, most notably when the Third Shelf constrains the final action. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Eleanor's reverence and anxiety.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure deepens through a cadence shift at the book and map reveal, narrowing Eleanor's options. The dominant stake (reconciling grief) is tested, and the cost of her choice is legible in the final image of her cradling the letters.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mother's letters and the final realization about hiding. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("hiding wasn't about retreat") that reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, slightly formal quality fitting a recluse. The line "its edges frayed from years in her pocket" exemplifies a specific perceptual signature. Minor filter verb use ("felt both out of place") but no major issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful with strong rhythm. A minor paraphrase loop occurs ("felt both out of place and oddly at home" / "felt seen") and the phrase "enlarged tranquility" is slightly elevated for the POV, but these do not significantly harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of a secret library is familiar but transformed through specific, grounded choices in character motive (grief) and the poignant payoff of the mother's letters. The synthesis feels organic and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
