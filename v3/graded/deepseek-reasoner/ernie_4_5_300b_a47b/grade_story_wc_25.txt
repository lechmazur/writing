<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to prove his theory is clear and consistent, driving his choices under pressure. His embodied emotion (trembling hands, breath hitching) and micro-choices (trusting instincts over the map) reveal character. However, the final renunciation of maps for whispers is more told than earned through a visible cost on the page, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing (whispers over shouts) with felt cost in the final image of the labyrinth shifting. The hybrid drive lens (causal actions within a situational storm) holds. The key's discovery is slightly convenient but pays off causally. Orientation is strong early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The labyrinth setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (ozone taste, vibrating metal) are selective and purposeful. The storm and container maze pressure tactics, and the zodiac symbols actively guide the protagonist's decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the storm's intensification and Elias's agency (using the key, choosing silence). The dominant stake (proving the theory) tightens meaningfully. However, the cost of his choice is more implied than viscerally felt on the page, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the whisper/shout dichotomy and the labyrinth's sentience, resisting moralizing. The final image reweights prior material without statement. The zodiac coin and maps serve as coherent particulars rather than abstract symbols.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Elias's professional bias. Prose has a distinct texture ("its creases sharp as knife cuts"). Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. The voice remains consistent under pressure, with purposeful elision in the ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density. Sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Minor register drift in "less like a guide and more like a prayer" feels slightly elevated but not disruptive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concept of a sentient container labyrinth is fresh and specific. The geomagnetic storm and zodiac symbolism are synthesized uniquely. Risk-taking in the quiet, conceptual closure pays off, and the premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
