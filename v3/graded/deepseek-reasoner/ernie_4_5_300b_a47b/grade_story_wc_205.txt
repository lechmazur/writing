<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a past of rebellion and a present of poetic archaeology. His internal conflict between action and observation is embodied in his "poetically inclined" nature, which influences his unique plan. The final choice to plant the fungi is a credible, earned micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values. A slight deduction for the abstract phrasing of his motivation "burned like a slow fuse," which trends toward label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost: the displayed shard is a promise, reconfiguring the meaning of the past and future. The inferred lens is Causal, held throughout via Kael's plan and its consequences. The cost is legible in the final image of Kael holding the shard with "burnished sorrow." The structure is a clean two-shard sequence (atrium covering → post-storm confrontation) with one transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vividly rendered and purposefully pressures choices, most notably the temporal storms which are integral to the plot. The crystal vase shard and the bioluminescent fungi are key micro-settings that constrain choice and decisively charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kael's archaeological POV. Spatial choreography in the atrium is clear and consequential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the Causal lens: his plan to cover mirrors directly triggers the vision and the Council's retaliation. The dominant stake (proving the Luminari fraud) tightens meaningfully through the storm vision and the fungal evidence. The cost is legible in his declaration of heresy and the tangible risk he incurs. A minor deduction as the Council's opposition is somewhat summary, though their actions provide adequate pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between memory and erasure, truth and myth. The core concept of the dispute is fully integrated, and the final image of the shard as a "promise" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The recurring motif of mirrors and reflections is charged with meaning, transforming from conduits of lies to metaphors for obscured truth. Avoids moralizing, sitting in complex sorrow and hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable, deeply embedded in Kael's poetic and archaeological consciousness. The voice is distinct, with a lyrical yet precise texture ("time had only recently become visible as a shimmering cobalt haze"). The prose effectively modulates between reflective observation and high-stakes action. Minor deduction for a occasional slight register drift into more abstract phrasing ("burnished sorrow").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. Sentences are purposeful and advance multiple layers of story and character. A minor instance of potential scaffold exists in the phrase "sharp as regret," which leans slightly decorative. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exemplary, with no loops or artifacts that obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a baroque asteroid, temporal storms, memory-hoarding cults, and bioluminescent archaeology is highly original and feels organic, not checklist-driven. The central conceit of covering mirrors to stabilize time is a brilliantly absurd and specific choice that arises from character. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on historical erasure and revolution. The story commits fully to its unique vision.</comment>
