<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lirael's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with her artistic perception filtering the world. Her final choice to teach others is a credible renunciation earned by prior causality. The "steadily adaptive" trait is more told than shown in the present action, creating a minor motivational gap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, landing with felt cost in the final image of her walking with new purpose. The pattern of frost-reading is taught early and pays off, creating a coherent, inevitable arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The canyon setting is vividly rendered and actively pressures choices, constraining her crawl into the crevice. The frost and the glass shard function as micro-settings that charge the final image, with sensory detail purposefully filtered through her artistic POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Lirael's agency under the Accumulative lens—her decision to read the frost and follow the pattern. This deepens her knowledge and narrows her options, culminating in a choice with a clear, on-page cost: the foreclosed path of simply returning to her old art.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of frost-patterns and glasswork, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of purpose. The final realization—"not to create objects but to mark time"—reweights the prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a luminous, perceptive voice that consistently filters the world through her artistic sensibility. Minor overwriting in phrases like "a bowl of indigo" slightly strains the voice's credibility in a high-pressure opening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A slight tendency toward dense figurative language in the opening paragraph creates a minor momentum drag, but it quickly clears and does not harm the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of glass artist and frost-map reader is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is fully committed to, with risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
