<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elio’s motivation is clear and embodied through tactile micro-choices. His final renunciation of the object for the act of singing is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the reconfiguration of the courtyard.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands on the page with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory density to a final image of promise. The persistent constraint of silence shapes all tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is a crucible that constrains and enables choice. The halo fragment and the courtyard are micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's goal-directed action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens, with a single meaningful cadence shift (the wind bells' chime) that reweights the stake. The cost is legible in the transformed silence of the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of finding potential in silence emerges organically from events and images. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the courtyard, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature. The prose has a distinct texture and rhythmic control, and any elision (e.g., the door's origin) is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor scaffold exists in adjacent sentences describing the carousel ("peeling paint and splintered wood"), but it does not obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The combination of a silent carpenter and an abandoned circus feels organic and specific. The core premise offers a fresh angle on renewal, though it hews closely to a familiar archetype of the quiet craftsman, limiting its transformative ingenuity.</comment>
