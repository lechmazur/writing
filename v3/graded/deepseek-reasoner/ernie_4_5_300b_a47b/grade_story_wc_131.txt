<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara's characterization is strong with consistent traits (kindly, methodical) and clear motivation rooted in her desire to help others. Her internal conflict is shown through the sense memory, and her final shift to feeling "seen" is earned. However, the emotional depth under peak stress could be more embodied rather than stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly: the tape discovery motivates the investigation, leading to the decoder find. Closure is a decisive change (she feels seen) with cost (new responsibility). Orientation is clear within 120 words. The only minor flaw is the decoder's convenience, but it doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The library setting is vividly rendered and actively constrains choices (pipe chases, crawl space). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's expertise. The environment charges the final image ("sapphire hush" returns). No white-room syndrome or generic placeholders.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (helping others, becoming visible) are signaled early and escalate through Mara's agency. The tape's sense memory tightens pressure, leading to the decoder discovery. Cost is legible in her altered self-perception. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of invisibility, guardianship, and hidden histories emerge organically from the tape and library setting. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The "sapphire hush" motif recurs meaningfully. Avoids thematic statement or prompt-like language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature attuned to library details. Prose rhythm is controlled, and the voice remains consistent under pressure. The few lines of dialogue (on the tape) are functional. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good momentum. Minor deductions for occasional dense phrasing ("sapphire hush" is slightly ornamental) and a template cadence in the opening description. No major artifacts or loops that obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The concept of a library crawl-space dweller uncovering a hidden message via sense memory is fresh and specific. The synthesis of elements feels organic, not checklist-driven. The ending transformation is earned through prior causality. Avoids derivative premises.</comment>
