<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is rooted in a concrete, embodied past trauma ("the way her mother’s sobs had once been muffled by a lullaby"), compelling her high-stakes choice to enter the firmware. Her final action of reading the letters is a credible renunciation of her escape into star maps, foreclosing that path with a visible emotional cost. The revelation of Dr. Althea Voss is a potent, earned twist that deepens the personal stakes. A slight deduction for the convenience of the backstory perfectly dovetailing with the firmware's function, but the closure choice remains powerfully motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (the dissonance is gone) earned by Lira's on-page action of reading the mother's letter, with a clear felt cost in her emotional confrontation. The inferred causal lens holds strongly: the amber's pulse leads to Elara's explanation, which triggers Lira's plan, executed via the letters. The twist of Dr. Voss's identity is a powerful because/therefore linkage that tightens the final beat. The cost is legible in the silent lab and faded amber.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The "laboratory of lost sounds" is a masterfully rendered micro-setting that actively pressures the narrative, its atmosphere of "ozone and regret" integral to the premise. The piece of amber is not merely described but functions as a key object that constrains choice (Lira must use it to enter the firmware) and charges the final image as its glow fades. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Lira's professional and personal bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preventing universal dissonance) is signaled early and escalates coherently under the causal lens through Lira's agency. Her decision to "tether the firmware" is the key tightening choice that narrows her options to a single, high-risk path into the digital labyrinth. The cost is legible in the lab's final silence and the emotional price of confronting her mother's guilt. A minor deduction as the escalation, while clear, relies heavily on exposition from Elara to manifest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the confluence of Lira's personal guilt and the scientists' technological sin, exploring the cost of silencing pain and the necessity of forgiveness. The core concept of haunted firmware is perfectly integrated with this theme, not merely echoed. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the concrete image of the letters transforming cries into a hum, reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lira's specific, professional perception ("her needle a silver quill"). The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates effectively under pressure, becoming more urgent yet controlled. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven and carries distinct subtext, particularly in Elara's cryptic warnings. The voice remains coherent and specific throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong rhythmic control and information density. Sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously (e.g., "The lab’s air tasted of ozone and regret"). A minor instance of potential register drift exists ("digital ghosts that whispered in binary" feels slightly elevated for the POV), but it is consistent with the story's voice and does not obscure clarity or harm the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of constellation tattooing, haunted firmware, and emotional archaeology via antique letters is strikingly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on reconciling with the past. The story commits fully to its singular artistic stance, and the risk-taking with its conceptual blend heightens the stakes without becoming a gimmick.</comment>
