<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mapkeeper's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, with embodied emotion ("ribs ache") and a micro-choice (pressing the stone) that reveals her values. However, her internal contradiction is more summarized than dramatized in-scene, and the final endurance feels slightly declarative rather than fully earned through on-page struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the final image of the duet of hush and hum reconfiguring the caves' meaning. The cost is legible in the energy beings' transformation from a "storm" to "rain on stone." The spiral pattern is taught early and pays off decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are indispensable, actively pressuring the protagonist and supplying the key resource (the ice wall). The environment constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply integrated with action, particularly in the tracing of the ice's "fossilized echo."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the rising "tidal wave of noise" from the energy beings, forcing the protagonist's focused conjuration. The dominant stake (restoring silence) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. The cost is felt in the protagonist's physical pain and the profound, "velvet" silence that forecloses the prior chaos.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of balance between sound and silence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the "duet of hush and hum"—that reweights the premise without moralizing. The integration is specific and avoids abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture. However, a minor register drift occurs in the peak beat with "hammered repose," a slightly elevated phrase that feels outside the narrator's established lexicon, slightly dulling the immediacy of the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly evocative and rhythmic, with excellent information density. One mixed metaphor slightly muddles clarity: "melting into sound" contradicts the established physical logic of the ice, which shatters and vibrates but does not melt. This is a minor artifact in an otherwise strong execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of sonic energy, geological formation, and myth feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of the bloom of hush is a non-obvious, ingenious solution that transforms a familiar "restore balance" trope through specific, lived detail and a unique moral calculus of integration, not banishment.</comment>
