<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, analytical trait. His final change from observer to feeler is earned by the fragment's transposition, with a visible cost in his shattered detachment. However, his internal contradiction—simultaneous analytical drive and emotional awakening—is more summarized than dramatized in the peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Decisive Change under a Causal lens: Elias's actions (using the press) directly cause the transposition, forcing his emotional awakening. The cost is legible in his fogged goggles and tears. The lens holds from his goal-driven start to the earned consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The workshop and halo fragment are vividly specific and deeply integrated. The fragment is the micro-setting that constrains choice (resisting calculations) and charges the final image (settling coolly in his palm). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's analytical POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Causal lens: his deliberate disorientation tactic directly triggers the fragment's retaliation. The cost is unmistakable in the workshop's dissolution and his emotional overwhelm. The dominant stake (understanding emotion) is tested and transformed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The theme of emotion vs. analysis emerges organically from the core concept and is resolved through the non-literal, resonant final image of the cooled fragment. It avoids moralizing, though the line "Emotions weren’t variables; they were wildfires" edges toward thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized by Elias's analytical voice. The prose has a distinct, rhythmic texture that modulates with pressure ("lucid turbulence"). Purposeful elision (the invented language) is taught and pays off. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and propulsive with excellent rhythm. Minor figurative muddle occurs in the climax ("kaleidoscope of memories" slightly abstracts the embodied experience). A single paraphrase loop ("confusion was a solvent for certainty") is present but does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial artifact, letterpress mechanics, and the concept of transposed empathy is highly original and feels organic. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, making the ending feel inevitable.</comment>
