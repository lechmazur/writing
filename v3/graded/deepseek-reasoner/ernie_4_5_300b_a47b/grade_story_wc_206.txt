<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's professional focus and Lira's embodied grief create a potent crucible. Her admission of her husband's lie is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values and earns the stone's transformation. Both characters exhibit contradictory impulses acting in scene, and the final renunciation of dishonesty carries a visible, felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (the stone flares, the melody returns) earned by Lira's admission, landing with clear cost under a hybrid (causal/accumulative) lens. The covenant's rule ("truth tethered to action") provides a persistent constraint that shapes the final tactic. The only minor slip is the covenant's role feeling slightly more thematic than causal in the mechanics of the repair itself.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is indispensable, actively shaping the repair process and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's professional POV (e.g., "air thickened into a syrup of sound"). The chamber constrains the choice, as the entire "tethering" action depends on its properties.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the hybrid lens: Elias's diagnosis and Lira's subsequent confession constitute a meaningful tightening that narrows options and forces a trade-off (truth over comfort). The cost of this choice is legible on the page in the stone's flaring reaction and the shift in the melody.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of truth mending spiritual corruption emerges organically from the core concept and character actions, resisting moralizing. The final image of the box playing steadily offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The covenant's creed is fully integrated into the story's logic and outcome without being a prompt echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice has a distinct, consistent texture of lyrical precision and professional focus ("copper walls vibrating like the skin of a drum"). POV is stable and all knowledge is character-bound. The dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries significant subtext, particularly in Lira's question, "What truth?"</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, original metaphors. A minor -0.1 deduction for a slight rhythmic stumble in the phrase "its melody devolving into dissonance," which feels slightly less fluid than the surrounding text. Otherwise, information density is high and momentum is maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a music box repairman, a philosopher's stone fragment, and a "covenant of rust" is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept of mending through unraveling lies is a fresh, non-obvious inflection that heightens the stakes. The story commits fully to its premise without safety-hedging.</comment>
