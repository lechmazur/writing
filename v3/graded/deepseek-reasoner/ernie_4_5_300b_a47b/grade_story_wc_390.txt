<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's "logically emotional" contradiction is embodied in his struggle between equations and the key's song, compelling his final choice to "let it sing." His micro-choices under pressure (adjusting the resonator, standing firm against the ghost) reveal a clear hierarchy of values. The final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost (collapsing, then rising).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly; the ghost's arrival is a because/therefore escalation from the key's faltering signal. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where harmony, not force, resolves the conflict, with cost legible in Elias's collapse and the ghost's lesson. Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is a micro-setting that pressures choices (ice crunches, vibrations pulse) and charges the final image ("the ice creaked beneath him"). The resonator is a tool that constrains tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's professional perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (protect the key) and escalate through the ghost's appearance and sonic clash. Elias's agency drives the escalation (matching the pitch, articulating the key's true purpose). The cost is unmistakable: physical exhaustion and a reconfigured understanding of his duty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of harmony between logic and emotion, life and death, emerges entirely through action and image (the resonator's shift, the ghost's bow). The final image of the key singing offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The core concept of "sonic absolution" is fully integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature blending technical precision ("frequency dial," "vibrational signature") and emotional weight ("logically emotional, a paradox"). The ghost's dialogue crackles with menace, distinct from Elias's steady voice. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm that accelerates during the conflict. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("horizon bled tangerine," "edges flickering like a broken film reel"). No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse engineering, sonic technology, and spectral harmony feels fresh and organic. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and conflict. The final reconfiguration of the key from weapon to bridge is a non-obvious, earned inflection.</comment>
