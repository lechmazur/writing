<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a tranquil yet determined drive to preserve peace. Her embodied emotion ("moss cushioned her knees") and micro-choices under pressure (mapping the silence) reveal character. The final renunciation (the wing crumbling) feels earned by her prior dedication. A slight deduction for the "terrestrially cosmic" eyes, which feel more like a label than a trait that actively constrains or enables choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens fits best, with pressure building through sensory density and pattern. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the hush successfully averts the prophecy, with cost legible in the wing's dissolution. The lens holds, and the prophecy's code provides a persistent constraint. The "whispered secrets" timeframe is somewhat vague, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and purposefully integrated, constraining choice and charging the final image. The brook's reflection is a key mechanic, the moss and fireflies provide tactile grounding, and the nocturnal haven's atmosphere is palpable. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the POV, avoiding cliché. The environment is a active participant, not a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification through the act of mapping the silence, which reweights the dominant stake. The cost is felt in the wing's dissolution and the summoner's focused endurance. The pressure is coherent and the resolution is earned by her agency. The stakes, while clear, could be slightly more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of silence as a active, mappable force. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the crumbling wing and resumed brook, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The integration of prophecy, code, and hush is sophisticated. The concept avoids abstraction through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice has a distinct, poetic texture with controlled compression ("smoothed hush"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through the summoner's perception. Diction and rhythm are purposeful and heighten pressure. A minor deduction for the slightly repetitive use of "flow" and "hush" in adjacent sentences, creating a faint template cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control. However, a pattern of repetitive stems emerges: "smoothed hush" (3x), "flow/flowed" (3x in key beats), and "terrestrially cosmic" (2x). This synonym churn and slight template cadence, while not fatal, dulls the closure image's clarity and prevents a higher band score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of origami, prophecy, and silence as a magical language feels fresh and specific. The core concept is committed to and followed through with integrity. The combination is organic, not a checklist. It's a strong, singular vision, though the archetype of the solitary magic-user prevents a top-tier originality score.</comment>
