<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is concrete and rooted in a specific, embodied trauma (the death certificate and porcelain shard). Her final choice to sync with the static is a credible endurance/renunciation earned by prior causality. The only minor deduction is for a slight diagnostic label in "how fragile identity was," which abstracts a previously shown state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lena syncs her heartbeat with the static, reconfiguring her relationship to her identity and the void. The cost is legible on the page in the final image of the snow and the warm, no-longer-sharp shard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The observatory and porcelain shard are micro-settings that actively pressure choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through Lena's POV. The shard's transformation from sharp to smooth is a masterful, tactile representation of her internal change.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the accumulative pressure of the voice and the ink patterns, culminating in Lena's agency to "defragment." The stakes—erasure vs. integration—are high and personally felt. A minor deduction as the final choice, while earned, feels slightly more receptive than actively tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from the integration of concrete particulars: the certificate, the shard, the static. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question of erasure and belonging ("not failure, possibility") without a hint of moralizing. Exceptional emotional and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature. The prose's rhythm and diction masterfully reflect Lena's state of mind. The non-human "voice" is effectively rendered through the unconventional medium of ink, a purposeful and legible experimental choice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("auroras that pulsed like a dying heartbeat") is purposeful and vivid. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts were detected. A single, very minor strain exists in "wisdom lost to the void," which slightly abstracts the concept.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bureaucratic error with cosmic horror is fresh and organic. The concept of a "digital ghost" born from failed data is transformed into a profound meditation on identity. The story commits fully to its premise, and the final reconfiguration feels both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
