<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and intensifies through micro-choices (hesitation, then offering her own letter). Interiority is concrete and character-particular, avoiding stock phrasing. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("It’s not mine to give" admission).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Liora understands rejoining isn't about possession. Cost is legible in the final image of the thrush shadow. The monk's dialogue feels slightly convenient but doesn't break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and constrains choice (the installation forces Liora's action). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("air smelled of wet stone and crushed petals"). The temple and orbs charge the final image, reweighting prior material.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens (Liora's decision to offer her own letter). Cost is legible in the relinquishment of personal secrets. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images and events, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to secrecy and connection ("the thread was there"). Subtext operates in gesture and implication (the unsent letter spiral).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt; voice has distinct texture ("the ghost of the thing"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though brief. Some register elevation ("prismatic quiet") but consistent with voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical without obscuring clarity. Rhythm varies naturally; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor figurative stacking in peak beats but pattern is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of ghostwriting and art installation concepts feels inevitable. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
