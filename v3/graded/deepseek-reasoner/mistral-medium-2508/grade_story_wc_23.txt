<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's characterization is concrete and particular, with micro-choices under pressure (tracing the censer, sketching coordinates) revealing her hierarchy of values. Her internal contradiction—navigating ruins instead of ships—is dramatized, not summarized. The final choice to build with maps instead of materials is an earned endurance that forecloses a path with visible cost ("the weight in her chest felt lighter").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Lena's endurance forecloses a path with visible cost ("the weight in her chest felt lighter"). The inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through pattern (lunar calls, map-making) that culminates in a cadence shift. A persistent constraint (loss) shapes tactics and the final image. Cost is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The signal station and censer foot function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("rusted antennae swaying," "click of the station’s dying relay switches"). The environment pressures choices and subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. The censer foot's evolution ("patina deepening") is integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens—Lena's decision to answer calls and build maps deepens the stake (navigating loss). The midnight call forces a stance crystallization, narrowing options. Cost is legible in the final image ("the weight in her chest felt lighter"). One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events and images (reverse migrations, building maps of loss). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the censer listening and the weight lightening. Subtext operates in implication ("echoes of herself"). Complexity resists tidy morals, embracing ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature ("humming with the ghosts of transmissions"). Voice modulates with emotional intensity without convergence. Dialogue (phone call) is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Purposeful compression (backstory integration) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control ("its rusted antennae swaying in the salt wind"). Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs. Minor register drift in "geography of loss" is voice-motivated and does not harm clarity. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Originality synthesizes nautical and supernatural elements into a fresh, non-obvious angle. The core premise (navigating loss through cryptic calls) is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking (lyric mode, accumulative design) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
