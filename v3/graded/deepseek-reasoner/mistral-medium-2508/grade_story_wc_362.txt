<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in specific traits; his internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure feel authentic. The final renunciation (destroying the prism) is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("his shoulders unknotting"). Embodied emotion avoids diagnostic speech, though peak stress could slightly more degrade perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a decisive change (shattering the prism) with felt cost (melting frost, unknotted shoulders). Orientation is immediate; the prism's transformation from absorber to answerer tightens options coherently. Cost is legible in the final image's clean streams and stillness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quartz arbor and frost patterns constrain choices (communion, destruction) and charge the final image (chiming branches, melted streams). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's expertise. The car's micro-setting evolves causally with events, avoiding static repetition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving absorption) escalates under accumulative lens through density increase (prism warming, frost moving) to a tightening choice (shattering). Agency is clear; cost is legible in the release of sorrow. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of echoes and burdens emerges through events (prism's history, frost visions) without statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("some hushes were meant to stay shifted"). Subtext operates in images like the melting frost, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct; perceptual signature is character-specific (measuring silence, reading frost). Lyrical compression is taught early and pays off at closure. Rhythm modulates with pressure (e.g., "His breath came in ragged bursts"). No dialogue, but internal voice coheres.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; no loops or artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful ("skeleton of light," "truthful lies") and consistent. Sentences accelerate with crisis ("Elias jerked back") without obscuring clarity. Read-aloud test passes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Premise feels fresh and organic; the prism's role transforms the trope of haunted objects. Specificity (frost patterns, quartz arbor) avoids genericness. Risk-taking in lyrical style heightens stakes without gimmickry. Synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
