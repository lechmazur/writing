<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's internal contradiction (pragmatism vs. mysticism) is dramatized through his micro-choices with the cork and scent. His final renunciation of the tool is earned by Harkin's visible transformation, with cost legible in the fishermen's slower hands and Harkin's pocketing of the cork "like a secret." Embodied emotion avoids diagnostic labels, as in "throat ached with the effort of holding the note just right."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of vibrations, scent, and cork intensifies to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the lighthouse shifts from warning to invitation. Cost is felt in Harkin's softened skepticism and the "clean, bright ache of dawn." Orientation is immediate; the cork's purifying trait is established early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse and dead garden function as micro-settings that constrain choice (Elias uses the garden's memory to beckon boats) and charge the final image (Harkin whistling as he polishes brass). Sensory details are purposefully filtered through Elias's POV, like the lantern room's "cool glass" and the "scent of night-blooming jasmine."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens: his quiet effort to bend reality intensifies through the turning boats and Harkin's arrival. The dominant stake (proving whispers > shouts) tightens when Harkin's skepticism dissolves upon touching the cork, with cost visible in his "shoulders sagged as he pocketed the cork."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme (whispers vs. shouts) emerges through particulars—the cork, vibrations, and scent—without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Harkin's whistling and the lighthouse's hum becoming "an invitation." Subtext operates in gestures like Harkin's grip tightening "in recognition."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical perceptual signature ("like a bruise against the pale dawn"). Purposeful compression (e.g., "tender, screaming only in its precision") is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and no scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is consistent and legible ("the way a knife screams when it parts flesh cleanly"). Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., the cork embodying theme and motivating action).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mystical realism with lighthouse keeping feels inevitable. The core concept (vibrations of intent) is transformed through specific, grounded details like the vial cork and garden scent. Risk-taking in quiet escalation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
