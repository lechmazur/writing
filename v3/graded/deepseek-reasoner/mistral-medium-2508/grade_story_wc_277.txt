<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lydia's characterization is precise and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (tracing the pen nib, starting a new ledger) revealing her hierarchy of values. Her final intervention is earned by prior causality—the discovery in the ledger and the plates—with visible cost as she commits to publishing. The trait "devotedly observant" is dramatized through her pattern-noticing, not just stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly: the journalist's call provokes investigation, the ledger discovery raises stakes, and the plates' arrival enables closure. The decisive change (publishing the story) occurs on-page with cost—breaking the orbit of regret—and is shaped by the persistent constraint of the inherited pen and observatory setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The observatory setting is indispensable, its acoustics carrying sound to heighten tension and its dome framing the sky's transition. The rosewood pen nib constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Lydia's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency: Lydia's investigation tightens options through the ledger discovery, and the plates' arrival deepens stakes. Cost is legible in her "half relief, half grief" reaction and the commitment to publish. One meaningful tightening (ledger reveal) and deepening (plates) suffice for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the orbit metaphor and pen nib's recurrence, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"orbits could be escaped"—through the concrete action of writing and the final image of tomorrow's ink. Complexity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature tuned to patterns and precision. The prose has rhythmic control under pressure ("The orbit breaks here"). Purposeful elision (e.g., the journalist's full dialogue) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Minimal artifacts: one minor paraphrase loop ("Regret was an orbit, yes. But orbits could be escaped") slightly dulls closure, but figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of heiress, observatory, and investigative logic feels inevitable. The orbit concept transforms a familiar trope through specific grounding. Risk-taking in compressed structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No derivative echoes.</comment>
