<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's characterization is exceptionally concrete and particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her internal contradiction—salvaging while refusing to offer false comfort—is dramatized in scene. The final choice to use the locket herself is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the warped snow globe and her whispered defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, crystallizing Lena's stance that "cracks are how the light gets in." The cost is legible in the final image of her kneeling, carving another name, and the glacier's sigh. The lens holds, with pressure accumulating through pattern and cadence shifts that reweight the dominant stake of salvaging meaning from wreckage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and melted snow globe are micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Lena's POV. The environment pressures tactics, as seen when the widow's tears fall on the globe and the ice groans like a ship. The recurring object evolves in use and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with a meaningful cadence shift when Lena turns to her own locket. The cost is unmistakable in the scent of salt and diesel and her mother's silent reproach. Pressure coheres and tightens through density increase, reweighting the stake of salvaging with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, particularly the snow globe and the final line about cracks and light. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to find meaning in loss. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing. Emotional honesty is maintained without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in Lena's way of noticing. Diction and syntax reflect her state and world, with rhythmic control under pressure. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Purposeful compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose exhibits exceptional rhythm and clarity, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing rather than obscuring sense. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs. The final line lands with perfect cadence and resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of ghost whispering and wreck diving, transformed through specific, grounded choices. Emotional truth and human complexity are prioritized over surface novelty. The final reconfiguration feels earned and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure and perspective heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
