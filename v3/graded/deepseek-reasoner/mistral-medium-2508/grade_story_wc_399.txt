<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lysan's motivation to preserve "quieter wisdoms" is clear and intensifies under the prophet's pressure. Her micro-choices (kneeling, pressing her forehead to the parapet) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final stance of endurance ("I can hold it long enough") is earned by prior causality. A slight deduction for interiority that occasionally leans abstract ("the way one senses a storm").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing her stance of endurance with cost felt in the "weight in her chest." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density and thematic resonance. A minor deduction: the cost, while felt, is slightly abstract; a more concrete, embodied price would strengthen the landing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is exceptional and indispensable. The kinetic parapet and murmuring pavilion are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through POV ("the air smelled of crushed mint and something older"). The environment is a crucible that pressures the protagonist's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the coherent, external pressure of the prophet's influence, which narrows Lysan's options to a single act of preservation. The dominant stake (preserving wisdom vs. fervor) is clear. The cost of her endurance is legible, though its conceptual nature keeps it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of wisdom surviving in whispers emerges organically from events and images, resisting moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer ("the echo of wisdom hummed, stubborn and bright"). Subtext operates powerfully in implication and silence, particularly in the companionable silence with the unseen voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical signature ("their voices threading through the murmuring pavilion like breath through reeds"). The voice modulates beautifully with pressure, compressing into sharper, more decisive statements at the climax ("No. But I can hold it long enough."). Elision is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Most sentences advance multiple jobs. A minor artifact: a slight over-reliance on figurative language in a few high-pressure beats ("like the first word ever spoken") creates a minor density bump, but clarity and propulsion are never harmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a half-masked mystic, a kinetic desert relic, and a "whisperfield" tone feels fresh and organic, not derivative. The core concept of "conjured clearings" is a specific, non-obvious angle on preserving knowledge. The story fully commits to its lyrical, accumulative premise.</comment>
