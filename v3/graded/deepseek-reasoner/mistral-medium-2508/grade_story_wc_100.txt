<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's weary persistence is embodied through salt-cracked hands and quiet stubbornness, with his final choice to revitalize the signal arising from established character logic—"he believed in rest." His micro-choice to press his forehead against the glass crystallizes his values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration where Elias's action brings stillness and redefines rest. The cost is legible when the lens crumbles and he adds his own name to the ledger, foreclosing his path with palpable weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The underwater library functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice—Elias must navigate its shelves and light jars. The lighthouse's "ribcage of iron" charges the final image, and sensory details like "bioluminescent anemones" are purposefully selective and mood-altering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the lens's insistent call, narrowing Elias's options to one necessary journey. His agency in climbing the lighthouse and fitting the fragments drives the climax, with cost felt when the lens's warmth vanishes after use.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept—rest is redefined through the final image of the dead sinking with "weight of something completed." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: "rest wasn't the absence of movement."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature marked by lyrical precision ("pulse slow, like the breath of a sleeping beast"). Compression is purposeful, and the voice remains consistent under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and evocative with high information density, though slight over-reliance on figurative language in peak beats ("like a trapped scream") mildly risks coherence. No loops or scaffolding; rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of post-apocalyptic elegy and mystical undertaker mythology feels inevitable and fresh. The core concept of a distress signal for the dead is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting, with bold risk-taking in the quiet, resonant ending.</comment>
