<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The carver’s interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (the chisel slip, the decision to hollow space) revealing a hierarchy of values. His final choice to teach his daughter is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost, though the "fiercely meditative" trait is more told than shown in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, landing with undeniable cost in the final image of the door. The lens holds from the dense opening imagery through the pattern break of hollowing the stone, culminating in the butterfly trade that reconfigures family grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk is indispensable, constraining choice through its cracked glass and damp earth, and charging the final image as a lantern. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the carver’s professional and emotional priorities, with the butterfly migration projecting constellations that transform the space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: the chisel slip deepens the emotional stake, and the decision to hollow the stone is a meaningful cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. The cost is legible in the transformation of the stone into a vessel and the carver’s vow to teach his daughter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of collective grief as a shape to be carved and held emerges organically from concrete particulars (the ribbon roll, the hollowed stone) and offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image of the door reweights prior material with profound ambiguity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature biased by grief and craft. The prose has a controlled, lyrical rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The spectral father’s dialogue carries a distinct, mentorship idiom that doesn’t converge with the carver’s internal voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("dusk bled," "wings like stained glass") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. One minor paraphrase loop exists ("the dead do not leave us" / "the dead were not gone") but does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and butterfly migration is fresh, non-obvious, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully committed to and follows its implications without retreat, transforming familiar grief tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and world.</comment>
