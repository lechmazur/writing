<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied ("the heart thudded against his ribs, not in fear, but recognition"). The final choice to become a vessel rather than a teller is earned through prior causality and carries visible cost in the dissolution of the wing and the bittersweet return.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the protagonist reconfigures his purpose, with cost legible in the final image of the steeping herbs and the "warm and bittersweet" taste of truth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating tea house and the blue morpho wing are not just vivid but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The wing's dissolution is a pivotal cost, and the mist functions as a tactile, evolving environmental pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens (tracking the sun, painting in the square). The cost is unmistakable as the wing dissolves into his palm, a price paid for the transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of storytelling, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The theme of stories as a connective tissue that fills human hollows emerges organically from the particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are maintained throughout. The single instance of dialogue is natural and carries significant subtext, advancing the plot without exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and propulsive. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a high-pressure beat ("the quiet explosion of being seen" feels slightly abstract amidst concrete imagery). Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A highly original synthesis of concept and character. The premise of a donor heart granting not memories but a metaphysical connection to narrative is fresh and executed with conceptual integrity, fully committing to its implications.</comment>
