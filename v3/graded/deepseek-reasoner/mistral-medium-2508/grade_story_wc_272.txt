<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "redesign" and descend is clear and rooted in her artistic struggle, culminating in a credible renunciation. Her internal conflict is embodied in the tactile handling of the tarot fragments. The final choice to become the canvas feels earned, though her specific artistic flaw ("failures to hold") is stated rather than fully dramatized, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; pressure escalates through the library's encroachment and the tarot's unraveling. Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara reconfigures the fragments into a map and steps into the dark, with cost legible in the lighthouse's final shuddering breath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, actively pressuring Elara's choices. The lighthouse, library, and tarot box are not just described but constrict and enable her final action. The "luminescent ache" of the dark that opens is the final, charged image, reconfiguring the entire environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (unfinished portrait, broken reality) and escalate coherently under the Accumulative lens via the library's physical pressure and the tarot's fragmentation. Elara's agency in redesigning the box is the pivotal tightening, forcing a trade-off with a visible cost—the dissolution of the lighthouse and her former self.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tarot imagery and the act of unmaking. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question about broken frames, reweighting loss and darkness as a form of wholeness. Avoids moralizing, sitting in complex ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized through a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature. The prose's rhythm and diction are consistently controlled, even under peak pressure ("a luminescent ache"). Purposeful elision (the keeper's dissolution) is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor risk of figurative density exists ("its beam a flicker of memory, its walls a slow exhale") but it is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative mode, never obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a decaying lighthouse, a forgotten library, and tarot symbolism feels fresh and inevitable. The central conceit—redesigning meaning by untangling, not repairing—is a specific, non-obvious angle on fragmentation that fully commits to its premise.</comment>
