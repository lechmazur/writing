<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in the aching hands and the weight of unwritten words. The final choice to conduct feels earned by the accumulation of memory and sensory detail, with visible cost in the renunciation of his prescribed role. The father's drunken metaphor becomes a lived reality, not an epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through layered images (shell, ice, spire) that culminate in the Charged Poise of the final gesture. Closure is a decisive reconfiguration of agency, with cost felt in the ignored courier and the shattered horizon he chooses to engage with instead.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The glass spire and frozen lake are not just backdrop; they actively constrain and charge the final image, amplifying sound and refracting time. The nautilus shell recurs with reweighted meaning, transforming from a memory object to a tool for understanding his role as a conductor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the first line (prophecy's weight) and escalate through the groaning ice and impatient courier, forcing a crystallization of stance. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds via sensory density until Li Wei's decision to conduct becomes the only possible response to the tightening sonic and emotional landscape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of transforming memory into active creation emerges organically from the fusion of specific details—the textile mill, the cats' meow-pitch, the conductor metaphor. The final image answers the central question of how to fill silence without stating a moral, reweighting prior material through the act of conducting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature that filters the world through sound and memory. The prose rhythm modulates beautifully with emotional intensity, from the hushed interiority of the spire to the expansive, orchestral final paragraph. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A single minor artifact: "the ink bleeding into the shape of a treble clef" risks a slightly overly-convenient metaphor, but it is pattern-taught by the musical motif and pays off at closure, so the deduction is minimal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The concept of a fortune cookie writer as a literal conductor of reality is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The specific lived details of the drowned village and the textile mill ground the high concept in emotional truth, making the final transformation feel both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
