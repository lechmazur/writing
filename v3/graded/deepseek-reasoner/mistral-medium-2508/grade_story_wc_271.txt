<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's characterization is deeply embodied and contradictory—her desire to hate the tourists shifts to a complex acceptance, revealed through micro-choices like not correcting the child. The final renunciation (releasing the photo) is earned by prior somatic practice and the therapist's advice, with visible cost in the palm-press and the empty pocket. "Quietly talented" informs her observational precision but doesn't constrain choices, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density (wind, leaf scent, tour group laughter) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on-page with cost—the empty pocket space and the decision to prune deadwood—reconfiguring her stance from freezing time to making room. The final image of the leaf as a new anchor is legible and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The arboretum is indispensable: it constrains choice (the wall, cypress branch) and charges the final image (leaf veins mirroring cracks in stone and ribs). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—citrus-resin scent, fibrous paper—filtered through Lena's expertise and trauma. The setting evolves from refuge to active participant in her reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by accumulative pressure: the tour group’s intrusion deepens the stake (optimism vs. realism), forcing Lena’s stance crystallization. Agency is endurance and attention—releasing the photo, taking the leaf—foreclosing grief with visible cost (the empty pocket). One meaningful tightening suffices under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the final image (leaf as roots) offers a non-literal answer to balancing loss and persistence without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (smoothing the photo, plucking the leaf) and the therapist’s advice, which is dramatized rather than stated. Complexity resists tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct: perception is filtered through Lena’s trauma and horticultural expertise ("pruning fig trees," "cypress bark"). Syntax modulates with emotional pressure—short, sharp sentences for pain; lyrical flow for reflection. No dialogue, but internal voice is coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence openings and lengths. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("pearl of stillness," "weight in her chest wasn’t grief, but something heavier—something like roots"). No loops or artifacts; closure image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in the synthesis of trauma recovery with arboreal imagery, avoiding cliché. The somatic method and photograph release feel earned and specific. Risk-taking in quiet resolution pays off with emotional authenticity, though the tour group is a minor convenience.</comment>
