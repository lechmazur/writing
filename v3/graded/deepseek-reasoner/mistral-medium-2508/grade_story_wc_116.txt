<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation to "witness change without judgment" is a consistent, high-stakes choice that intensifies under the refuge's pressure. Their endurance is earned, foreclosing a path with the visible cost of their dissolving identity ("their edges blurring"). The final choice to fold a new swan is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values, cementing their role as a witness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Earned Stasis, a refusal to rejoin the world that forecloses a path with the conceptual cost of the keeper's humanity. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through density of imagery and a final cadence shift. The cost is legible in the final image of the keeper being "swallow[ed] whole."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The library's decay and the obsidian refuge are not just described but are active, causal forces that shape the keeper's actions and ultimate dissolution. The river's backward flow is a brilliant, specific detail that reinforces the theme and alters the keeper's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single, decisive intensification: the keeper's entry into the refuge and subsequent dissolution. The dominant stake of enduring to witness is tested and crystallizes into a final, cost-heavy stance. The price of their choice is felt in their blurred edges and the library's patient consumption of them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of meaning found in surrender and silent witness emerges organically from the keeper's specific, dramatized struggle. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the keeper as "a fold in the quiet." It reweights the entire narrative without moralizing, embracing profound ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is exceptionally distinct, with a perceptual signature tuned to decay and silence ("regenerative silence," "crumbling peace"). The prose's rhythmic control is masterful, modulating to match the contemplative, pressurized atmosphere. Purposeful elision (e.g., "Upstairs, if there even was an upstairs anymore") is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative overload in the refuge's description ("walls exhaled dust that reformed into lost languages"), which, while beautiful, slightly risks obscuring immediacy at a peak beat. Otherwise, line-level craft is exemplary and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mystical refuge, origami magic, and a chronicler's dissolution is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable. The concept of "regenerative silence" is a singular, high-risk artistic stance that the story commits to fully, resulting in a memorable and authentic vision. The quiet ending is a bold and successful choice.</comment>
