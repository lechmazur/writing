<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation evolves from passive endurance to active craving for expanded silences, crystallized in micro-choices like swallowing the father's fear-silence. The final choice to abandon the bunker is earned through prior causality of trellis encounters. Internal contradiction visible in "safety was just another word for shrank" versus the expanding silence of the doll.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence flavors accumulate pressure toward the decisive change of unfolding the bunker. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—"You were never the lock. You were the door"—that reweights the premise with cost (abandoning father, destroying home). Orientation is immediate; who/where/when anchored in first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bunker and trellis are micro-settings that actively constrain and enable choices. The doll's porcelain texture and the trellis's "bone-white vines" charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects POV: coppery air, frost-like silence, and tactile "petals of steel" unfold through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity to survival through protagonist's agency—climbing the trellis, taking the bloom, unfolding the bunker. Cost is legible: father's "empty" silence and the bunker's collapse. Pressure coheres under accumulative lens via intensifying silence flavors and inversion events.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of contraction vs. expansion emerges through concrete particulars: shrank lungs versus sprouting tendrils. The ending offers a non-literal answer—tasting "beginning"—that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in images like the doll as "key" and the bunker as "coffin."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control ("safety was just another word for shrank"). Purposeful compression and patterned diction ("sprout," "flavors") are taught early and paid off. POV is stable and voice-consistent, though some figurative density in peak beats slightly strains immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is pattern-taught but occasionally over-dense in high-pressure beats (e.g., "silence that tasted like his fear—sour, metallic"). No loops or artifacts. Sentence-level propulsion varies effectively with scene urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of claustrophobia and metaphysical growth through sensory specificity. The "gilded hush" and "intangibly tangible" sprouting are non-obvious and irreplaceable. Risk-taking in lyric abstraction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise transforms familiar bunker tropes through lived detail.</comment>
