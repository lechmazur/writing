<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The guardian's silent, observational role is consistent and embodied, though her motivation is more implied than dramatized, costing a fraction. The boy's internal conflict is concrete and his micro-choice (discarding the note) is a credible, earned shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of the father and mirror reconfigures the silence between them with a clear, felt cost. Causality is tight and taught through pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, dental mirror, and shutters are not just atmospheric but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is masterfully selective and purposeful, fully integrated into the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift (the weaving intensifies) that reweights the dominant stake (the boy's shame). The cost of his unburdening is legible on the page in his physical release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of silent empathy emerges entirely through image and action, resisting moralizing. The final line refines but does not replace the earned resonance. The concept is fully integrated and complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent, lyrical perceptual signature. Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off. The boy's single line of dialogue feels natural and goal-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic with high information density. One minor artifact: the adverb "spiralingly" feels slightly forced and register-elevated for the voice, but it's a hairline slip that doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a silent guardian using a dental mirror is fresh and specific. The core concept feels organic, not checklist-driven. Slight deduction for the archetypal nature of the "fractured soul" trope, though it is well-executed.</comment>
