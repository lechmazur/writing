<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("calloused thumb tracing the groove") and micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, though the sister's backstory feels slightly less integrated than other names.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable conceptual cost ("letting the weight... pull the world back toward balance"). Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and the persistent constraint of the carved names shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The tidal obsidian ridge and clock tower function as micro-setting, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("sea below gnawing at its roots"), filtered through POV bias to reflect urgency and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the pendulum's altered cadence serving as a meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake. The cost is legible in the council's impending outrage and the splintering rake handle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of incremental absolution emerges organically from events and images, resisting tidy morals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of continued carving, reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure, with purposeful compression and patterned elision (the list of names). POV is stable and voice-consistent, with diction remaining within the character's plausible lexicon throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density and clear propulsion, with figurative language that is pattern-taught and pays off. Minor rhythm issue in the sister's backstory paragraph, but no loops or scaffold. Read-aloud ear test is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of time, guilt, and absolution feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the core concept is fully committed to.</comment>
