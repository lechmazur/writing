<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses act simultaneously (love for garden vs. pragmatic betrayal), embodied emotion ("fingers tracing fractures"), and final renunciation earned by prior causality. Micro-choices under pressure (polishing marbles, leading elders to center) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of brokenness/mending culminates in Conceptual Repricing where garden's agency revalues "unmeasurable" worth. Closure lands with cost ("boots crushing delicate shoots") and persistent constraint (pragmatism) shapes tactics. Orientation clear by line 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Garden maze constrains choices (hiding marbles, directing elders) and charges final image ("vines twining around glass"). Sensory detail purposeful ("cracked marbles gleamed like veins of silver"), filtered through POV bias. Spatial choreography coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency (non-argument, deliberate reveal) under Accumulative lens. Single meaningful deepening (elders witnessing garden's choice) reweights stakes with cost (crushed shoots). Persistent constraint (pragmatism) narrows options until repricing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (marbles, blooms, roots) without moralizing. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer to measurable vs. unmeasurable value. Subtext in gesture ("elders returned with empty hands") and implication. Complexity embraced without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("cracked marbles like stolen luck"), rhythmic control under pressure. POV stable and apt. Diction consistent with character's worldview. Experimental compression (time jumps) taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("shattered promises" slightly decorative) but no coherence issues. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level rhythm supports emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of measurable luck and botanical sentience feels inevitable. Risk-taking (quiet ending, conceptual repricing) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific lived detail (polishing marbles, western wall ivy) avoids template plots.</comment>
