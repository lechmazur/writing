<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The conjurer's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in grief, compelling his high-stakes ritual. His internal conflict is embodied and concrete, particularly in the moment he presses his forehead to the stone, accepting ambiguity. The final endurance is earned by the scene's causality, though a slight abstraction in "the mathematics of emotion" prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure builds through dense, resonant imagery toward a decisive Conceptual Repricing. The closure lands with undeniable cost in the final lines: "some equations weren’t meant to balance." The pattern is taught early and pays off, with the mosaic and eyes constraining the final, resonant image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is indispensable, its decaying state and bioluminescent lichen actively pressuring the conjurer's choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the action, such as the stalactites' "slow, silver pulse" and the mist that curls "cool and questioning" around his wrists.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, using the ritual to intensify the emotional stakes. A single, meaningful cadence shift occurs as the mist forms and dissolves, reweighting the dominant stake of loss with a visible cost—the "damp imprint of his fingers on the air."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges masterfully from image and event, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of loss through the final realization and the title, *"The Algebra of Almost."* The concept of ambiguous loss is explored with profound complexity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a controlled, lyrical rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through the conjurer's precise, mournful perspective. Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Every sentence advances atmosphere and character without scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, as in "the orchestra of a patient earth." Read-aloud rhythm is varied and compelling, sustaining momentum to the final, resonant line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a conjurer, a cavern orchard, and taxidermy eyes into a meditation on grief is profoundly original and organic. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on loss, executed with authentic vision and bold risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
