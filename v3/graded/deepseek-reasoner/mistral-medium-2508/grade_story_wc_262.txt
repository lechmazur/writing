<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her final realization about love waiting is earned through embodied micro-choices. Contradictory impulses act in scene, like her gift/curse tension, and the renunciation carries cost. Slight abstraction in peak beats ("incubate the truth") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the silence and smile. Orientation is immediate; the booth's temporal labyrinth and film strip mechanics cohere. The final image reweights prior material without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Projection booth functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (threading film, spatial navigation) and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (ozone, old paper, rusted reels). The crystal ball and projector are recurring objects with evolving use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding love/letters) escalates through Elara's agency under accumulative lens—discovering letters are in the film grain, not physical. Cost is legible in her gasp and acceptance of silence. One meaningful deepening suffices; pressure coheres through sensory density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images (love as absence, silence as vessel) without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer to "where unused love goes" via the reel-turning metaphor. Subtext operates in gestures (smile, turning off projector) and resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded; voice has distinct perceptual signature ("labyrinth of time," "husked thunder"). Lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; diction remains within Elara's poetic yet grounded lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent ("sleeping beast," "thief of echoes"). No loops or scaffolding; sentence-level propulsion varies with emotional intensity. Minor mixed metaphor ("pooled like honey") doesn't harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of crystal gazing, psychometry, and vintage cinema feels inevitable. Core premise (love stored in film reels) is transformed through specific details (frayed film edges, projector's light). Risk-taking in poetic prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
