<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lena's characterization is concrete and embodied, with her phobia and stunt-double history actively shaping her choices under pressure. Her internal conflict—fear versus a decade of outwitting it—is shown simultaneously, not summarized. The final choice to dive is earned by prior causality (decrypting the cast, using the shell) with visible cost (bleeding onto the shell). The girl applies immediate pressure but is slightly underdeveloped as a secondary character, preventing a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred causal lens holds: betrayal motivates library intrusion; shell whisper and cast message provide therefore linkages to the ledger discovery. Closure is a decisive change (reclaiming proof of identity) with felt cost (blood on shell, foreclosing her erased status). Orientation is clear by line 4 ("rusted library," "Lena"). The ledger discovery changes knowledge and options decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted library and whispering shell are micro-settings that constrain choice (hiding, finding the ledger) and charge the final image (shell warm against skin). Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("rusted shelves sagging like old bones," "shell pulsed against her skin"). The shell's physicality is integral to the climax, constraining the choice to bleed on it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving existence/identity) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens: decrypting the cast message and using the shell as a weapon narrow options and lead to the ledger. Cost is visible (blood on shell) and alters tactics. One meaningful tightening (from hiding to active pursuit) is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme (vulnerability as power, fear as a current to ride) emerges organically from events (decrypting the cast, bleeding on the shell) and the final image, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material ("the very things they called weaknesses were the cracks that let the light in"). No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that reflects Lena's professional mindset ("slipping into the rhythm of old stunt diagrams"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though brief. Prose rhythm is controlled under pressure, with purposeful compression ("No. She wasn’t."). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor artifacts: "like a trapped thing" is a slight cliché, and "the shell now silent" is a near-duplicate of earlier descriptions. However, these do not obscure closure or causality. Figurative language is generally sharp and purposeful ("iron shelves sagging like old bones").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The combination of a stunt double with a phobia of water, a whispering seashell ledger system, and decrypting a child's cast feels fresh and organic. The core premise of contractual erasure is transformed through specific, grounded choices. The final reconfiguration (fear as a current to ride) is inevitable in hindsight and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
