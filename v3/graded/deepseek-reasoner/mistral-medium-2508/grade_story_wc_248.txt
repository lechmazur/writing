<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is complex and deeply rooted, with his past and present selves in clear tension. His final choice to burn the ledger is a credible renunciation, earned by the causal chain of his self-deception and the re-discovery of his true purpose. The cost is visible and felt in the final act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through layered revelations to a decisive Conceptual Repricing. The closure is masterful: the redefinition of the archive from tomb to womb and his final act of burning are legible, inevitable, and carry immense conceptual and emotional cost. Causality is tight and the orientation is immediate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The archive is a character in itself, a micro-setting that palpably pressures every choice. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's expertise and regret. Key objects—the tapestry, the key, the pillar, the ledger—constrain his actions and charge the final, devastating image of the fire.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled immediately with the charred codex and escalate through each discovered clue, culminating in the pillar's message. The dominant stake—the nature of the promise and his role in it—is profoundly reweighted. The final, agential choice to burn the ledger is a powerful, costly tightening driven by the protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the wreckage: the volatility of memory, the mercy of destruction, the burden of preservation. The final, non-literal image of smoke curling into an unasked question is a masterstroke of resonant ambiguity, reweighting every prior action without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly calibrated to the protagonist's analytical yet regretful mind. POV is stable and deeply internal, with a consistent perceptual signature. The prose's rhythmic control under peak emotional pressure is exceptional, particularly in the closing paragraphs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense, poetic, and highly efficient, with virtually no scaffold or loop artifacts. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "volcanic tenderness"), though the effect is largely purposeful and voice-motivated. Rhythm and syntax are expertly controlled to serve the story's accumulating pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of arsonist-archivist, the transformation of vandalism into a map, and the redefinition of destruction as an act of salvation feels fresh, inevitable, and deeply ingenious. The core concept is fully committed to and executed with breathtaking conceptual integrity and emotional risk.</comment>
