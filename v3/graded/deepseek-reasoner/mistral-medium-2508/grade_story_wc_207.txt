<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's contradictory impulses (search for answers vs acceptance of mystery) act simultaneously in scene. His final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("watching the ashes curl into the sky"). Embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure reveal character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with undeniable cost (burning notes, accepting absence). Orientation is clear by paragraph 2. The final image reconfigures meaning without mechanical explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices and charges the final image ("the lagoon still waited"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("water warm where it should have been cold"). Micro-setting (compass, arch) functions as environment that pressures tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens. Cost is legible when water releases him and he burns the notes. Single meaningful tightening (entering lagoon) narrows options and changes knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Ending offers resonant non-literal answer through image of collecting silence. Theme emerges organically from particulars. No moralizing; embraces meaningful ambiguity. The hinge motif transforms from literal to conceptual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature ("silence so thick it settled like dust"). Rhythmic control under pressure. Purposeful compression taught early. POV stable and apt for accumulative design. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold. High information density ("hummed with the memory of industry"). Figurative language consistent and purposeful. Sentence-level propulsion matches scene needs. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of psychometry and industrial decay feels inevitable. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific lived detail transforms familiar tropes. Authentic artistic stance throughout.</comment>
