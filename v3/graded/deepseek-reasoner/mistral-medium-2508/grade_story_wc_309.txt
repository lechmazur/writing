<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marlin's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in his "unremarkable" status and his connection to "lingering luminance." His final choice to walk away from the Conservatory is a credible Earned Stasis, foreclosing the path of institutional approval with the visible cost of their incomprehension. His internal contradiction is shown, not summarized, particularly in the line "I think I always did," which crystallizes his earned realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the roaring flame reweights the premise of automated creation with undeniable cost. The shift at the summit is a decisive cadence change that reconfigures the story's meaning. Orientation is immediate and the pattern of light and creation is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The icebound spire is a masterclass in micro-setting, actively pressuring Marlin's climb with "numb fingers" and "robes stiff with frost." It charges the final image by its stark contrast to the automated city below. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Marlin's struggle, such as the wind "howling like a choir of disapproving mentors."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a density increase of light and creation motifs, culminating in the garden's impossible summer. The dominant stake (finding the sacred) is tested and reweighted with cost. Marlin's agency is clear in his final renunciation, a choice that narrows his options and carries the cost of leaving the keystone behind.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of sacred simplicity emerges organically from the conflict between handmade and automated creation. It is answered non-literally in the final image of the merged, "unruly" lights casting "imperfect, flickering, *alive*" shadows. The piece avoids moralizing; the deans' demand for a "mechanism" is the only thematic statement, and it is effectively dramatized as opposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that notices light "cling[ing] like a memory." The prose has a distinct, rhythmic texture, modulating under pressure. The dialogue with the keeper is natural, goal-driven, and carries significant subtext about creation and forgetting. The line "mastery’s just another kind of forgetting" is a perfect example of voice-driven, thematic dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Most sentences advance multiple elements. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in describing the keeper as "unfinished, her edges smudged," which feels slightly elevated for Marlin's POV in a peak beat, though it remains legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a fantasy climb with a critique of automated art feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "lingering luminance" is specific and deeply integrated, transforming a familiar "magic school" trope. The final image is a bold, singular artistic stance that fully commits to its premise. The risk of a quiet, conceptual ending pays off spectacularly.</comment>
