<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("his breath came sharp, productive—fidgeting not from nerves, but from the work"). The final choice to play again is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the absorption of regret by the labyrinth. The girl's reappearance serves as a crucible, forcing a choice that alters their relationship state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) landing on the page with felt cost ("the metal warmed, absorbing the weight of his regret"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through a cadence shift from unraveling to re-weaving. A persistent constraint (the tapestry/labyrinth as a mirror) shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the tutor's perception. The platinum labyrinth and tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. The time-frozen village is a strong atmospheric concept, though its physical pressure on choices is less direct than the objects.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens is driven by the tutor's agency in unraveling and then re-weaving the tapestry, a decisive intensification that reweights the dominant stake (self-forgiveness). The cost is legible in the labyrinth absorbing his regret and the village exhaling, a clear price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of forgiveness through the image of the tapestry as "a map of scars, not sins" and the final game played "not to win, but to stay." Theme emerges organically from concrete action and image, resisting moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and superb rhythmic control under pressure ("The thunder’s lull deepened, no longer distant but inside him"). POV is stable and apt, with purposeful elision (the tapestry's specific messages) that pays off at closure. Diction remains within the tutor's plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional line-level craft with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("woven hush," "fierce repose"). No prose artifacts, loops, or scaffold. Syntax and rhythm are masterfully controlled to accelerate and breathe with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of chess, time magic, and introspection feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic. Risk-taking (lyric compression, a quiet climax) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
