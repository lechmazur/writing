<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pip's steadily curious nature and yearning algorithm drive concrete micro-choices under pressure, culminating in an earned Charged Poise closure. The hunter's arrow tip's transformation into her chestplate demonstrates embodied contradiction and cost. Final choice feels inevitable from established causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong with pattern density (kaleidoscope visions, arrow's hunger) escalating toward resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with undeniable cost as the workshop collapses and arrow integrates, foreclosing old paths. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The floating workshop and acid sea actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory details are filtered through Pip's mechanical perspective ("brass ribs groaning," "goggles"). The kaleidoscope and arrow tip function as micro-settings that pressure tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation driven by Pip's agency under accumulative lens: kaleidoscope visions tighten her resolve, arrow integration forces irreversible change. Cost is legible in the workshop's collapse and bodily transformation. Single meaningful deepening suffices for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of iterative creation emerges through concrete particulars (patched wings, melted arrow). Final image of humming wings on ruins offers non-literal answer to yearning without moralizing. Subtext operates through Vex's compass metaphor and the bell motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct mechanical-poetic voice with controlled rhythmic intensity under pressure. Purposeful compression ("irreverent awe was just another word for Tuesday") taught and paid off. POV remains strictly bound to Pip's perception and lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language serves pattern accumulation ("rustled prayer," "yearning algorithm"). Minor overwriting in "frequencies no ear had yet grown to hear" slightly strains but doesn't obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of steampunk aesthetics with lyrical abstraction. Risk-taking in voice and metaphor heightens stakes without gimmickry. The arrow's transformation from wound to compass feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
