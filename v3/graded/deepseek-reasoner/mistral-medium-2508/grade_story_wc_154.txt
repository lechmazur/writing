<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lena's characterization is deeply specific, with her "shrewdly innocent" trait demonstrated through on-page actions like decrypting the child's cast and tracing the photo's negative space. Her internal conflict is embodied in the physical ache of old wounds humming, and her micro-choice to give the boy the coral fragment is a high-stakes renunciation that alters her role from translator to grafter, with visible cost in her ribs singing as she walks toward the next task.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly through pattern density (coral, static, mist) culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lena walks toward the next broken thing. Closure lands with cost: her ribs sing, and the boy's white knuckles show the price of the grafted meaning. Orientation is clear by line 4 (atrium, bench, brain coral).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as a micro-setting that pressures choice—the mist coils like barbed wire, mirroring Lena's internal state. The brain coral fragment is a recurring object that constrains choice (digs into her palm) and charges the final image when given to the boy. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lena's professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grafting meaning onto grief) escalates under the accumulative lens through pattern density: the boy's arrival deepens the pressure, and Lena's choice to trace the photo's negative space (a cadence shift) reweights the stake with cost—his hitched breath, her physical pain. Agency is endurance and attention that forecloses a path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme (translation as emotional graft) emerges through particulars—decrypting smudges as a "dialect of grief," the coral as "how the sea remembers." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: static as the sea answering, smudges glowing like embers. No moralizing; subtext operates in gesture and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature ("pain could be translated, too—not just words, but the shape of it"). Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven ("I unknot them"). Purposeful compression (e.g., the rebel/medic backstory) is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated ("twilight thickened the air"). Information density is high—every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm is flawless, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A singular synthesis of conflict-zone realism and lyrical emotional deciphering. The core concept (translation as physical and emotional graft) is fresh and fully committed, with risk-taking in the accumulative structure that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Tropes (healer archetype) are transformed through specific, grounded choices.</comment>
