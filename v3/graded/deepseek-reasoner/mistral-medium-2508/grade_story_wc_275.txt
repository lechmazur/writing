<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Liora's pacifism and devotion to her father's legacy are embodied through concrete actions (carving phrases into bark, sheathing the knife) and internal contradiction (the sandbag's bite "like a reprimand"). Her final choice to endure and "anchor" storms is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost in the fissured glass and the taste of her father's sweat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is an Earned Stasis (refusal to leave) that reconfigures the premise from chasing storms to anchoring them. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through density of image and cadence shift ("The world had fallen. She would weave it back together"). Cost is legible on the page in the cracked pane and the ghost of sweat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The glass dome and roses are not just backdrop; they constrain choice (the fissure pressures her action) and charge the final image (the dome standing against ash). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Liora's expertise ("the roses bloomed in senselessly perceptive silence").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by environmental pressure (the cracking dome) under the Accumulative lens, forcing Liora's stance crystallization. The dominant stake (preserving continuity vs. chaos) tightens through a single meaningful cadence shift ("The tower was dust. The roses were not."). Cost is felt in the physical threat to the dome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of violence (airship wreckage, fallen tower) and cultivation (engraving quiet, sheathing the knife). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of weaving the world back "one thorn at a time," repricing the father's tools from tracking to nurturing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized through a distinct perceptual signature ("senselessly perceptive silence," "tasting salt and rust"). Lyric compression is purposeful and taught early, paying off at closure. The voice modulates under pressure without losing coherence or specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated ("crumbled like a child’s sandcastle under a boot"). One minor paraphrase loop ("quiet" repeated in adjacent sentences) prevents a higher score, but clarity remains untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fusion of post-apocalyptic decay and botanical cultivation feels fresh and inevitable. The pacifist bounty hunter's daughter premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
