<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amal’s motivation is a cold, dense star of grief that compellingly drives her high-stakes choice to pursue a cosmic violation. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, filtered through the geode and the memory of jasmine. The final choice—to give her grief a trajectory—is earned by prior causality and has visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inferred Hybrid lens (Causal/Accumulative) holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing her new target with undeniable cost felt in the "cold, dense star in her chest." Orientation is immediate and purposeful; the countdown structure provides a coherent, tightening pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The observatory is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices through its failing systems. The geode constrains choice and charges the final image, its facets reflecting the coordinates. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, fully filtered through Amal’s urgent, grief-sharpened perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Hybrid lens, pressure coheres and escalates through the countdown of the cooling breakers, forcing a tactical race against time. The dominant stake (finding the reservoir) is narrowed by this live clock, and the cost of her pursuit is legible in the final, charged poise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of stolen potential and cosmic theft emerges organically from the core concept and specific imagery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. A minor deduction for the geode’s symbolism feeling slightly convenient, though it is well-integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that masterfully blends the technical and the poetic. The voice—"a slow, metronomic cooling," "a serene blue lie"—is controlled and purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity without losing coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("deathwatch beetle," "cold, dense star"). One minor artifact: "intricately tangible" is a near-duplicate of the required element "intangibly tangible," causing a slight echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A singular, high-concept synthesis of grief and theoretical physics that feels organic and inevitable. The core premise is fresh and fully committed to, with bold risk-taking in voice and concept that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
