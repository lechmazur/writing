<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in guilt, compelling his high-stakes choice to silence the machine. His interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("his breath catching in his throat"). The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, foreclosing his path of grief with a visible cost—the cessation of his internal hum.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) landing on the page with felt cost ("The hum inside him ceased"). The accumulative/textural lens holds, building density through recurring motifs (amber, constellations) until the final cadence shift. The persistent constraint of his guilt shapes his tactics and the final, peaceful image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The amber and the server's circuitry are micro-settings that constrain Elian's final, crucial choice, charging the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("needle a whisper against skin," "sky the color of a deep bruise"), fully integrated into action and reflecting his professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a single, meaningful deepening as he recognizes Lyra's voice. The cost is unmistakable on the page, legible in the shift from anguish to peace. Pressure coheres and tightens through the density of motifs until the final choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of grief through the final image of the amber as a "golden tombstone." Theme emerges organically from events and images (constellations, sound, preservation), resisting tidy morals and embracing the complexity of loss and peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are maintained under pressure ("meteor hush," "profound quiet"). The POV is stable and apt, with a consistent, voice-motivated lexicon. The single line of dialogue from the technician is natural and goal-driven, advancing the plot without disrupting the narrative voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose is exceptional, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("meteor hush," "star-charts on his clients' skin"). Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. Zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of tattoo artistry, sound archaeology, and grief feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is fresh and fully committed to, with bold risk-taking in the haunted firmware concept that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The combination is organic, not a checklist.</comment>
