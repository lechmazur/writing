<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo's motivation ("to discover what ceilings hide") is clear and consistently drives his actions. His choice to "engage" is a high-stakes micro-choice that reveals his core values. However, his emotional state remains somewhat placid; a more embodied reaction to the ghost's agitation or the vision's jolt would have deepened interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds firmly: the power cut creates the silence that reveals the ghost, whose anxiety directs Leo's observation to the ceiling tile, leading to the discovery. The closure is a decisive change (the ghost's dissolution) with a clear, felt cost—the weight of the story Leo now carries. The final image of the "crack in the veil" being repaired is resonant and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a character, pressuring choices and supplying key clues. The "peeling paint," "phantom smell of popcorn," and "fissures" in the clown smiles are vivid, purposeful details filtered through Leo's perception. The drop ceiling and its dust patterns directly constrain Leo's choice and charge the final discovery, making the setting indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (discovery vs. safety) and escalate through a single, meaningful tightening: the ghost's appearance forces the choice to engage. Leo's agency drives the escalation entirely. The cost is the implicit weight of the story he inherits, though it is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of concept (cracks in the façade), setting, and action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of what is hidden, reweighting the "weightless burden" of Leo's purpose. It avoids moralizing, sitting in complex, earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, slightly melancholic voice that filters the world through Leo's unique perspective. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic quality ("Silence crashed down, thick and absolute"). No head-hopping or register drift. The elision of the vision's details is purposeful and effective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally polished and vivid with strong information density. A minor scaffold artifact exists: "Silence crashed down, thick and absolute, broken only by the drip of water..." slightly paraphrases the common "silence broken only by" template. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of an elevator repairman and a ghost-seer is fresh and organic, not a forced checklist. The concept of "cracks in the façade" is transformed through specific, grounded details in the setting and plot. The story commits fully to its singular vision and premise.</comment>
