<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied contradiction ("wave of vertigo," "trembled as they flew"). Her final choice feels earned by prior causality, though the "blink" metaphor slightly abstracts the decision's immediacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost ("heavier with the weight of what was to come"). The final image of the "blank page" reconfigures the story's meaning, charging the silence with impending consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("frost-rimmed data-vaults," "churning snow"). The setting provides atmosphere but does not fully constrain choices; the terminal is a resource but not a persistent pressure. The "echoing library" motif is strong but not indispensable to tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate through a single, meaningful tightening—the discovery forces a high-cost choice. Protagonist agency drives the escalation under the causal lens, and the cost is legible in the final, heavier silence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between truth and stability. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the "blank page," reweighting the prior material without moralizing. The central question of legacy is inextricable from Elara's arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, archival texture. Diction remains within character ("data-packet," "ghost nodes"). The elision of the Council's reaction is purposeful and paid off by the charged final poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and strong verbs ("swallowed," "churning"). Minor issues: "ghost in the machine" is a slight cliché, and "dizzying quiet" is repeated. No artifacts harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of cryogenic archive and political scandal feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "contraband truths" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. Risk-taking in the quiet, tense climax heightens stakes.</comment>
