<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent, his "calmly inventive" mind shown through his actions under pressure. His internal state ("tremor in his own veins") contradicts his external composure, revealing character. The final choice is earned by prior setup, though the smile feels slightly declarative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly. The closure is a decisive change (silent takeover) with clear on-page cost (the winking lights as a "silent promise"). Orientation is immediate; the "because/therefore" linkage from blackout to opportunity to successful activation is flawless and tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is integral, not ornamental. The luminous fort and its specific details (phosphorescent algae, moss-slicked stone) pressure the action and provide the medium for the revolution. The sundial is a key object that constrains the choice and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens. The dominant stake (control of the fort) is signaled early and tightens through his precise, risky action at the sundial. The cost is the palpable tension of discovery, legible in his "white knuckles" and held breath.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silent revolution emerges organically from the specific action of light-based communication subverting shouted orders. The final image of "new patterns of light" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how change is achieved without violence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, precise voice that matches Kael's character. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic quality ("a vigilant lock sentinel watching a world gone dark"). No dialogue is present, so those criteria are waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, specific diction ("pearlescent light," "ink-black backdrop"). Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on compound adjectives and a single potentially mixed metaphor ("cradle of sparks," though it works conceptually).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core premise of a light-based silent revolution during a blackout is highly original and ingeniously executed. The combination of bioluminescent setting, coded sundial, and quill-key feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight, fully committing to its unique concept.</comment>
