<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her internal conflict is embodied in the climactic weaving of trauma and beauty. The final peace feels earned by prior causality with visible cost. Slight deduction for a minor diagnostic label ("profound peace") at the very end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost in the final image of exhaustion and peace. The pattern of sensory translation tightens coherently, and the cost is legible in the surge of will and subsequent fatigue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The conservatory and the circlet function as micro-settings that directly constrain and enable Elara's choice. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully integrated into action, charging the final image on the winterglass panes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens; the unbidden memory intrusion creates a decisive pressure point. The cost of wrestling with trauma to achieve transformation is unmistakable on the page in the surge of will and the final exhaustion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of translating silence into beauty emerges organically from the core concept and action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the opened flower and the recharged tuning fork case, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a controlled, lyrical voice that modulates with emotional intensity. The perceptual signature is strong, and purposeful elision (the silent world) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. A minor deduction for a slight telling moment in the climax ("With a surge of will...") which abstracts a peak beat that could be more fully embodied, though it does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The core premise of translating silence through emotional heat-mapping is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The combination feels organic and inevitable, with bold risk-taking that heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
