<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (touching the bead, observing the ghost) revealing his values. His final realization is earned through prior causality, though the phrase "mournful elation" verges on diagnostic labeling at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens (causal memory triggers within accumulative atmosphere) holds. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (transference) with clear on-page cost in Lyra's dissolution and Elian's new burden. The bead's discovery and the ghost's appearances form a taught pattern that pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The greenhouse is a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choice, charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elian's professional POV. The "pearlescent bud" and "acid dew" are integral to the stakes and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the ghost's bolder appearances and the orchid's growth, driven by Elian's agency in engaging with the bead. The cost is legible in the toxic beauty of the plants and the final, bittersweet transference. One meaningful tightening is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</theme>The theme of debt, love, and legacy emerges organically from the specific imagery of the venomous nurture and the transference. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of dissolution and the clutched bead, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice that modulates under pressure. Purposeful elision (e.g., the specifics of the war) is taught and pays off. The ghost's silence is a powerful use of indirection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density. Minor rhythm issue in the long sentence beginning "Her love was a poison...". Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A fresh, specific synthesis of ghost story and alchemical romance. The concept of "lovingly venomous" care is original and integral. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coheres perfectly.</comment>
