<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, grounded power. Her solitary nature and focused calm are consistent, and her final act of endurance (Earned Stasis) is earned. However, interior contradiction is minimal; she is supremely competent without genuine struggle or a blind spot that complicates her choice, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a clear, felt cost in the final image of the prophecy's secrets being "asleep." The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through a decisive cadence shift and density increase. The origami wing acts as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, purposeful, and filtered through Elara's POV. The brook and origami wing function as a micro-setting that charges the final image. However, the setting does not actively constrain her choice; it is a supportive haven rather than a source of pressure, which caps the score below the 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens is driven by Elara's agency—her act of mapping and channeling silence. The stakes are clear and the cost of her effort is legible in the final, fragile stillness. A single, meaningful intensification is perfectly sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of quiet versus noise emerges organically from the core concept and specific actions. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of a "fragile blanket" laid over the fire, reweighting the prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with a controlled, consistent POV. Diction and syntax reflect Elara's calm, focused state. The patterned elision of the prophecy's actual words is taught early and pays off, contributing to the accumulative effect without causing disorientation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor artifacting appears in a few dense, figurative clusters (e.g., "tranquil blaze," "placid inferno") which slightly dull the immediacy of peak beats but do not obscure closure. Overall, high information density and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core concept of "mapping silence" is a fresh, ingenious synthesis of cartography and magic. The combination feels organic and singular, fully committed to its premise. The tranquil tone is a bold risk that heightens stakes and coheres perfectly with the closure.</comment>
