<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in family legacy, with embodied emotion and a credible micro-choice to use his unique attribute under pressure. His final renunciation of solving the puzzle in favor of understanding is earned by the dream's revelation. The only minor flaw is that his "heals with words" attribute, while thematically resonant, is more declared than demonstrated as a constraining trait within the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elian reconfigures his quest from decoding to understanding, with cost legible in the trembling hands and the final, calm image. The stellar dream sequence is a masterful pattern break that deepens the stake, and the linkage from the telegram to the stars to the lament is seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The observatory and the cosmic dreamscape are vividly rendered and deeply integrated. The cold copper eyepiece and the daylily-pressed telegram are not just descriptive; they constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered entirely through Elian's professional and emotional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift into the dream vision, which reweights the dominant stake from solving a puzzle to sharing a burden. The cost is the relinquishment of a generational goal, felt on the page in his trembling and the subsequent calm. The escalation is driven by his agency in choosing to witness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of shared sorrow emerges organically from the lament encoded in the stars and is crystallized in the final, non-literal image of the telegram as a promise. It is a profound, earned answer to the central question, avoiding moralizing completely. The thematic echo of the grandfather's words is transformed into a revelation, not a statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates perfectly with emotional intensity, from the weary opening to the ecstatic dream vision to the calm resolution. The POV is stable and deeply internal, with a consistent perceptual signature. The single line of dialogue (the telegram) is seamlessly integrated and charged with meaning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor risk of overwriting in the dream sequence (e.g., "glowing ideograms"), but the figurative language remains coherent and serves the climax. The prose is largely free of loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that obscure sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of astronomy, oneiromancy, and archeology is fresh and feels inevitable. The core concept of a civilization encoding its grief into variable stars is a high-risk, high-reward idea that is executed with conceptual integrity and grounded in specific, lived detail. It transforms familiar tropes of obsession and legacy.</comment>
