<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's dual allegiance and orderly intuition are embodied contradictions that drive his micro-choices, particularly the pivotal decision to use graffiti as a covert ledger. His final endurance is earned by the visible cost of his frantic heart as he watches the inspector, proving his motivation intensifies under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kael holds the foundation stone chip, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. The causal lens holds tightly: his plan (therefore) causes the inspector's confusion, which (therefore) changes the story the Consortium will be told.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The raft city is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices, constraining Kael's tactics to covert artistic rebellion. The foundation stone chip, a recurring object, charges the final image with immense thematic weight, solidifying its indispensability to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens: his method of embedding messages directly triggers the inspector's arrival and her subsequent confusion. The cost is legible in his "frantic drum" of a heart during the climax, a price paid for his gamble.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of survival through covert order emerges organically from the graffiti's transformation into a ledger. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the stone chip, reweighting the struggle without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The POV exhibits a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the carnival through Kael's orderly mind ("navigated its swirling crowds with an orderly calm"). The single line of dialogue is goal-driven and carries significant subtext, advancing the plot decisively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and efficient ("a chaotic symphony of calliope music, sizzling fry-oil"). Rhythm and syntax expertly modulate with the scene's pressure. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle obscure the clarity of the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a floating carnival with corporate gentrification is a fresh, non-obvious angle. The specific method of resistance—encoding economic data in anarchic art—feels inevitable in hindsight and is a bold, highly specific risk that perfectly heightens the stakes.</comment>
