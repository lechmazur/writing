<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alistair's motivation is clear and rooted in his identity as a preserver of culture, intensifying from despair to decisive action. His micro-choice to use the lens to survey the ice reveals character under pressure. The final choice to lead the singing is earned by prior causality, though the internal shift from despair to authority could be more embodied in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly: the frozen waterfall (inciting incident) causes silence/dread, therefore Alistair observes fractures, therefore he recalls ancient texts, therefore he persuades the city to sing. Closure is a decisive change (the thaw) with visible, felt cost (the return of the roar washing away the dread). Orientation is immediate and precise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto city and frozen waterfall are vividly rendered and actively pressure choices, constraining tactics and supplying the key resource (sonic resonance space). The phosphorescent moss and stone oven are purposefully integrated into action. The environment decisively charges the final image of the thaw.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (extinction vs. cultural survival) are signaled early and escalate coherently under the causal lens. Alistair's agency drives the key turn (pleading with the council, then proposing the solution). The cost of inaction is legible, and the resolution is earned by his alteration and the city's collective action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (memory as a tool for survival, not just preservation) emerges organically from the fusion of Alistair's motive and the climactic action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: saving their lives by singing their culture makes the theme concrete. The emerald lens and warm bread 'A' serve as potent, integrated motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filtered through Alistair's historical, observant perspective. Voice is distinct and consistent, with a formal, slightly elegiac tone apt for the character and stakes. The only minor flaw is a slight register elevation in phrases like "rosewater dread," which, while evocative, feels slightly outside his immediate lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is largely lucid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor deductions for moderate figurative density ("rosewater dread," "voice thin as spun glass") that, while effective, slightly slows momentum in early beats. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. The climax is rendered with clear, propulsive syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The core concept of using cultural memory as a literal survival tool is a fresh, ingenious synthesis. The combination of a frozen waterfall, opera glass, and resonant song feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. It transforms familiar tropes (climate disaster, last refuge) through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
