<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elias's characterization is masterful, with contradictory impulses (translator's calm vs. personal anxiety) acting simultaneously. His final choice to translate the child's "lexicon of shared anxieties" is earned by his established motive to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" and reveals his hierarchy of values. The embodied emotion ("lotus-hearted ache") avoids diagnostic speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under a Causal lens, landing with undeniable cost: the General's "stony expression flickered" and he swallows, a visible price for the reconfiguration. The because/therefore linkage is tight: Elias decrypts the symbols, therefore he chooses to translate the father's own heart back to him, which reconfigures the situation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice, isolating the characters and pressuring the intimate encounter. The "glass walls" and "thick mist" contrast the "sterile" inside with the external "humid chaos," mirroring the internal conflict. The brain coral, while less active, still charges the final image of memory and wounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: Elias's choice to lean in and decrypt the symbols is the key tightening, narrowing his options and forcing the final, high-stakes translation for the General. The cost is the General's visible, felt vulnerability, a price that charges the final image of something clearing in the atrium.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of shared humanity emerging from a "lexicon of shared anxieties" is fully integrated, arising from the concrete particulars of the decrypted symbols. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the General's flicker of recognition, reweighting the conflict without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, filtered through Elias's translator's mindset ("unknot meaning," "another dialect"). The prose has a distinct, controlled texture with a perceptive signature. Dialogue is sparse but potent, carrying immense subtext ("Secrets... For Mama"). No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "lotus-hearted ache" risks register drift, feeling slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon in a peak beat. However, it does not obscure closure and is an isolated instance in otherwise flawless line-level work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of a high-stakes mediation and a child's innocent drawings feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. The final reconfiguration is earned and feels both surprising and satisfyingly inevitable, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
