<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, compelling worldview ("to find the beginning in every ending"). Her micro-choices under pressure—defiantly jury-rigging a new method—reveal her values and competence. The final smile and log entry feel earned by her struggle, though the emotional embodiment in the climax leans slightly abstract ("a slow smile") rather than viscerally costed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens is Causal, held perfectly. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she achieves a new state of listening, with cost felt in the preceding system overload. The "because/therefore" linkage is tight: her discarded assumptions directly cause the successful method. The final image of the waiting city reconfigures the initial abandoned feeling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choice (the perilous perch, the rotting cables) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Elara's professional POV ("serenely electric," "ghost-whispers"). The radio tower and gorge are not just backdrop but active participants in the scene's pressure and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens. The dominant stake (finding the shard) is signaled early and tightens as the lunar perigee peaks, threatening to overwhelm her system. Her series of deliberate choices (discarding assumptions, inverting the gain) narrow her options and lead directly to the climax. The cost of potential failure is a palpable, on-page pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of finding meaning in silence emerges organically from the specific events and imagery, never stated outright. The core concept (shard of hush) is the literal and thematic prize, and its discovery offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's motivation. The ending reweights the entire narrative, transforming the abandoned city into a place of potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by her profession. The prose has a controlled, lyrical rhythm that modulates with the rising pressure. A minor register drift occurs in the climax with phrases like "coiled spring of reality," which slightly elevates diction beyond the established voice, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and varied sentence structures. Information is efficiently layered. A brief instance of figurative overload occurs in the climax ("void so pure and absolute it had substance," "coiled spring of reality"), creating a minor muddle in an otherwise clear and propulsive peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cosmic signal interpreter seeking a "shard of hush" via a Hollywood star fragment is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is fully committed to and followed through with specific, grounded choices in character and method. The risk-taking with the speculative concept pays off with coherence and meaning.</comment>
