<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("mournfully eager," spectral fingers as "more memory than matter"). The final choice to macerate the leaves is a micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values—noisy care over silence—with visible cost in the wife's tear. His motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling higher-stakes choices. The emotional progression is realistic, with his eager sorrow fueling the engine's start.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens dominates, building density through sensory and emotional patterns. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the wife's fragile smile, a decisive change with felt cost. Causality is tight: his three pulls on the cord escalate effort, and the resulting sound directly triggers the family's response. The final image reweights the premise of haunting as care.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel and leaf blower are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (dust motes, cold engine, whipped hair). The environment is integrated into action, shaping tactics—the hallway amplifies his communication. Spatial choreography is coherent from garage to hallway.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring emotional connection) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: each pull on the cord deepens effort, culminating in the engine's scream. Cost is legible in the wife's tear and smile, a trade-off between grief and memory. The maceration action forecloses stagnation with visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief and communication emerges through particulars—the leaf blower as conduit, maceration as destruction of neglect. Subtext operates in the humming beneath the mechanical noise, a ghost of memory. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: healing begins through noisy care, not silence. Avoids moralizing; the wife's smile is a complex emotional counterpoint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature ("silence so dense it felt like a physical weight"). Lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, from dense silence to roaring symphony. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>High information density with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("leaf blower symphony conductor," "ghost of a tune"). Syntax accelerates with the engine's start, creating propulsion. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and natural, supporting the emotional cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis: ghost as leaf blower conductor transforms haunting into an act of care. The concept feels inevitable in hindsight, grounded in specific detail (two-stroke engine, pull cord). Risk-taking with tone (blending mechanical rage and lullaby) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth avoids generic templates.</comment>
