<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in embodied grief, with micro-choices (placing the eyes, channeling focus) revealing his values. His final peace is earned through the ritual's causality, with visible cost in the lattice's depiction of pain and memory. Contradictory impulses—raw pain versus cherished moments—act simultaneously in the projected light, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory and emotional density, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the light lattice articulates his heart. Closure lands on-page with cost ("vast, dark polygon of the void"). Orientation is immediate; who, where, and when are anchored by line 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cavern orchard and mosaic stone are indispensable, constraining choice (kneeling at the heart, placing eyes in depressions) and charging the final image (light projected on the wall). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("scent of wet limestone," "damp earth").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elian's agency under the Accumulative lens: his ritual intensifies emotional density, leading to a decisive cadence shift (the hum, the glowing lattice). Cost is legible in the lattice's "jagged edges" and "dark polygon," reweighting the stake of ambiguous loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the mathematics-of-emotion concept, avoiding direct statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to loss through the shifting lattice of light and shadow. No moralizing; complexity embraces pain and memory without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with lyrical, precise diction ("ghost-pale apple trees," "resonant frequencies"). POV is stable and deeply internal, filtering everything through Elian's grief. No dialogue, but internal voice is coherent and specific under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exquisite line-level craft with high information density and rhythmic control. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Prose is propulsive and vivid ("luminous ghost-pale," "shimmering lattice"). Sentence variety supports emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of magic and mathematics to explore grief. The core premise feels inevitable and risk-taking, with specific, grounded choices (glass eyes as lenses, mosaic as algorithm). No derivative echoes; authenticity of vision is singular.</comment>
