<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear, rooted in academic passion transformed into urgent rescue, compelling higher-stakes choices. Her careful resourcefulness is embodied in her methodical search for gaps, a credible micro-choice. The final step into the library is a decisive change earned by her argument, with the weight of futures a felt cost. Minor deduction for a slight diagnostic label ("Being carefully resourceful") introducing her method.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through pattern recognition (gaps, moss, vine) culminating in a resonant reconfiguration (the mountain's acceptance). Closure lands on-page with cost (the weight on her shoulders) and the path opening is a decisive change. The botanical pattern is a persistent constraint that shapes tactics. Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The Scriptorium is a vivid, purposeful setting that pressures choices and supplies resources (the diary, the catalogs). The environment actively constrains her path, ending at the wall of silent rock. The final image of the staircase of roots and pages is charged by the setting. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her scholarly POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (save the future) and escalate through her discovery of the map, forcing the terrifying renegotiation. The final choice to step down is a decisive act driven by her agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the "weight of all possible futures." A single meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge hoarded versus shared emerges organically from the core concept and Elara's argument to the Curators. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this question. Subtext operates in the botanical coding and the silent melody of gaps. The piece resists tidy morals, embracing the complexity of preservation versus application.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a scholarly, perceptive voice that modulates under pressure ("the frantic beat of her own heart"). The prose has a distinct texture and rhythmic control. The "unheard symphony" motif is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and dense, with strong momentum. Figurative language ("unheard symphony," "smoke made of scripture") is consistent and purposeful. A minor instance of potential scaffold exists in the phrase "Being carefully resourceful," which tells a trait shown immediately after. Rhythm and sentence variety support the accumulative build effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise synthesizes familiar elements (library, time traveler) into a fresh, specific whole through the botanical cryptology and the concept of unlearned lessons. The resolution feels earned and inevitable. The choice to use a non-linguistic code (plants) is a specific, non-obvious inflection that heightens stakes.</comment>
