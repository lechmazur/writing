<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kenji's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a hierarchy of values. His final renunciation is earned by prior causality, diffusing grief through a credible, character-specific ritual. The emotional progression is realistic, avoiding tidy resolution. A slight over-reach in the "cerulean regret" metaphor is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a felt cost on the page ("the regret had transmuted into simple, quiet contemplation"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with a cadence shift reweighting the dominant stake. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length. The climax is slightly summarized versus fully dramatized, a minor flaw.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Kenji's POV. The islet and compass function as micro-settings that charge the final image. However, the environment does not actively constrain a choice; it primarily mirrors internal states. This prevents a 9+ score under the quick test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with the turning tide serving as a coherent pressure that forces stance crystallization. The cost of his transformed grief is legible on the page. A single meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of grief and reconciliation emerges organically from events and images, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of shaping silence. The lace pattern and compass are particulars that charge the thematic closure without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose's texture—lyric yet precise—reflects Kenji's mind state. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language is consistently purposeful. A single minor artifact ("cerulean regret" slightly strains the established voice) is a hairline slip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief-work, nautical mythology, and coded lace feels organic and non-obvious. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The risk-taking with a quiet, internal climax heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
