<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation evolves credibly from suspicion to stewardship, with micro-choices like organizing the youths and declaring the garden plan revealing her hierarchy of values. Her final choice to let the donor's identity remain unknown is an Earned Stasis that feels rooted in her developing wisdom.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot escalates through pattern breaks (anonymous gifts, the bell's appearance, the seed offering) that reweight the dominant stake of hope. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the community's stance crystallizes into active rebuilding, with cost felt in the final image of hard labor replacing passive receipt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Elara's perception of want (e.g., "monochrome of want," "amplified quiet"). The terra-cotta arbor and silver bell are charged objects, though the arbor's constraining pressure on choice is slightly less defined than the bell's symbolic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake of survival escalates to one of legacy through Elara's declaration, a decisive act of agency that redefines the community's relationship to the donations. The cost is legible in the shift from consuming gifts to the labor of building a future, a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between consuming charity and building a legacy. The final image of the community planting offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to endure, reweighting the prior donations as a catalyst for intergenerational renewal rather than passive sustenance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's perception, with a distinct perceptual signature ("every stomach growl like a judgment"). The prose rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity, and the single declarative paragraph of her speech is a purposeful, voice-motivated structural choice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is concise and highly evocative, with strong information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously ("The quiet was still there, but it was no longer amplified by fear"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle detract from clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sanctions backdrop with a mystery benefactor and a community's rebirth feels organic and specific. The transformation of the arbor from a "place of ghosts" to a site of future harvest is a fresh, earned inflection. The concept is strong, though the anonymous donation trope is familiar, if well-executed.</comment>
