<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kavi’s frugality is a consistent, embodied trait that drives his meticulous actions and his final, quiet triumph. His motivation to "seal a covenant with the unknown" is dramatized through his precise, costly ritual, and his final choice of renunciation (keeping the secret) is earned by his prior characterization. The emotional cost of his solitude is felt, but his endurance is credible and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural drive lens holds perfectly, building pressure through the meticulous, ritualistic description of the schematic until the resonant reconfiguration at closure. The final image of the star-cloud is a decisive change in Kavi's knowledge, landing with a profound and quiet cost—his eternal, solitary possession of the secret. Causality is tight and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ziggurat observatory and the schematic diagram are not just vivid backdrops but active, constraining elements of the plot. The setting pressures Kavi's choices, and the obsidian dust and chalk lines are tools he must use with frugal precision. The final image is charged by the specific, tactile details of the environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through the increasing density of sensory and procedural detail, tightening the focus to the final, pivotal act of placing the tile. The dominant stake—Kavi's quest for transcendent knowledge—is tested and fulfilled with a clear, on-page cost: the permanent, solitary burden of his revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from the central conflict between empirical rigor and mystical faith, culminating in the "empirically ironic" miracle. The final image of the star-cloud is a perfect, non-literal answer to Kavi's quest, reweighting the value of knowledge versus material wealth without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, elevated, and precise perceptual signature that perfectly reflects Kavi's scholarly and devoted mind. The voice is consistent and controlled, with a rhythmic cadence that modulates to heighten the ritualistic tension of the climax without ever becoming obscure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional. The prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive, with every sentence serving multiple functions of character, atmosphere, and plot. There are no artifacts, loops, or scaffold; the figurative language is coherent and powerful, particularly in the climax ("the universe breathing in").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of ancient astronomy, mathematical mysticism, and a deeply personal character study feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "encrypted devotion" is transformed from a trope into a specific, lived reality through Kavi's meticulous actions and the story's unwavering commitment to its premise.</comment>
