<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, consistent trait ("functionally creative"). Her internal state is shown through concrete action and perception, avoiding diagnostic labels. The final realization feels earned by her on-page struggle, though the transition from vague philosophical search to tangible problem could be slightly more embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal drive lens is clear and holds. The sextant discovery triggers a because/therefore chain of investigation and action. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the star chart's resurrection reconfigures her understanding of hope with a clear, felt cost of isolation and wonder.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the plot, constraining and enabling Elara's choices. The spaceport terminal and carnival debris are not just backdrop but supply crucial resources (generators, cables). The final image of the star chart casting light on the trash charges the closure perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly under the causal lens from a personal search to a tangible engineering problem. Her agency drives every turn, from finding the sextant to rerouting power. The cost is the immense effort and the solitary wonder of the payoff, which is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the specific action of resurrecting a hidden purpose from decay. The final realization that hope is a "current to be rerouted" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial question, perfectly integrated into the climax and avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and filtered through Elara's engineering mindset. The prose has a distinct, precise texture. The only minor deduction is for a slightly mixed metaphor in the opening line ("ghosted overnight, leaving behind the ghost of a ghost"), though it is voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally concise and vivid with strong momentum. A minor artifact: the phrase "diesel-fueled electricity" creates a slight register clash with the otherwise precise technical lexicon. This is a hairline slip that does not significantly harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a spaceport, a carnival, and a civil engineer's quest is fresh and specific. The core concept of a "maze of intentions" is transformed from a abstract idea into the literal mechanism of the plot. The ending feels both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
