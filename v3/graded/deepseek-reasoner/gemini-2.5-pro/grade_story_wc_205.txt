<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear, rooted in consistent traits, and intensifies under the storm's pressure. His final choice—to wage a "quiet war of interpretation"—is earned by the shard's revelation. The micro-choice to leave the shard uncovered is a perfect, character-specific action that reveals his values. A slight deduction for a moment of diagnostic self-awareness ("He was a poetically inclined man") that feels slightly external.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the shard's vision reweights the premise of the entire civilization with undeniable cost. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, as pressure builds through the storm's sensory density and the shard's coalescing light. The cost is legible in the final image of Kaelen holding the "cornerstone of a lost people's dignity" and feeling the "old fire."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is not just decorative; it pressures choice through the need to cover mirrors, a constraint that directly enables the shard's revelation. The environment is vividly rendered through selective, POV-filtered detail ("chiseled spires," "gilded filigree"). The shard itself functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the temporal squall, a coherent external pressure that forces a stance crystallization. The dominant stake—the truth of a civilization's soul—is signaled early and meaningfully deepens as the shard absorbs the storm's energy. The cost is the protagonist's renewed commitment to a difficult, personal battle, felt in his "sad, determined smile."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of art versus sterile data emerges organically from the conflict and is crystallized in the shard's silent poetry. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reimagining baroque excess as a "dam of art against the coming tide of oblivion." It embraces complexity, resisting a tidy moral in favor of a powerful, earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice has a distinct, poetically inclined texture that remains consistent under pressure. The prose is characterized by a controlled, elevated diction that fits the POV character's worldview. Purposeful compression is used effectively, and the single POV is stable throughout. A minor, almost imperceptible register drift in the "poetically inclined" line prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is highly polished, with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("a sliver of frozen light," "sound of burnished sorrow"). A very slight risk of overwriting exists in the density of metaphors in the storm description, but it does not obscure clarity or harm the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a baroque asteroid city, temporal squalls, and an archaeological dispute feels fresh and organic. The core concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, poignant conclusion. The choice to make the climactic revelation a quiet, visual one is a specific and ingenious inflection that heightens the stakes.</comment>
