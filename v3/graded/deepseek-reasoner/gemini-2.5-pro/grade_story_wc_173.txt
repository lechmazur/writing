<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; her internal contradiction (chaste courtesan wielding power through withheld intimacy) is dramatized through embodied micro-choices like the ritual dance. The final renunciation of her harvested burden is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the "deep, resonant sigh."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: echoes accumulate toward a decisive reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost via the "colorless light" wave and Elara's smile, reweighting the city's consciousness. Orientation is immediate; the prism's function is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (e.g., "silver courtyard," "frigid air"), filtered through Elara's perception. The prism sanctuary constrains choice as the ritual's focal point, though the courtyard itself is more atmospheric than tactically pressuring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in unwinding each echo, tightening toward the judge's keystone thread. Cost is legible in the "immense burden" released and the wave of light that reweights the city's stakes. One meaningful deepening suffices under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the "harvest of echoes" concept and the final image of seeded rebellion. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to conformity via whispered change, avoiding moralizing. Subtext operates in gestures like the "silent scream" danced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a poetic perceptual signature ("a ghost in white silk"). Diction remains within Elara's lexicon; syntax modulates with ritual intensity. No dialogue, but internal voice is coherent and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and dense, though minor overwriting occurs in peak beats (e.g., "psychic weight of a decade’s harvest" verges on abstraction). Rhythm accelerates with the dance, and closure clarity is unharmed. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Premise is strikingly original: a courtesan’s chastity as weaponized mystique and emotional echo-harvesting as rebellion. Synthesis feels inevitable; specific details (e.g., "prism sanctuary of salvaged starlight") avoid tropes. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
