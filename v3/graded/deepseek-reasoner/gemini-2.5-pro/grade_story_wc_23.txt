<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is deeply rooted in the loss of his daughter, compelling his high-stakes choice to build the lighthouse. His internal conflict is embodied through concrete actions like clutching the censer foot, and his final, tearful endurance forecloses a path with a visible, felt cost. The emotional progression is realistic and avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through the precise assembly of the antenna. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the signal activates, offering a stark solace with clear cost felt in Elias's tears. The cryptic calls provide coherent, non-coincidental guidance that tightens the narrative toward its climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The starlit signal station and the patina bronze censer foot function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's professional and personal bias, such as the obsidian sky and the dish's metal latticework thrumming with energy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the density of instructions and the final, precise placement of the censer foot. The dominant stake of providing a path home for the lost is tested and deepened, with the cost legible in Elias's tearful realization that he has built a road for others, not his daughter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of reverse migration and the specific image of the censer foot, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to navigating loss through the silent song of the signal, reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptual signature that reflects Elias's worldview. The single line of dialogue from the phone call is layered with static and purpose, advancing the plot. The prose's rhythmic control under pressure supports the accumulative drive without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic without artifice, achieving high information density and rhythmic propulsion. Figurative language ("geography of loss," "ocean of regret") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift obscure the climax's clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a reverse migration and a metaphysical lighthouse is a fresh, non-obvious angle on post-apocalyptic material. The concept is fully committed to and followed to its logical, emotional conclusion, with risk-taking in the quiet, resonant ending that heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
