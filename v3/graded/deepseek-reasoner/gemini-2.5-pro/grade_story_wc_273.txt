<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear, rooted in a specific trauma and a "holy rage." His internal state is rendered through concrete, embodied perception ("chalk-pale skin," "red eyes narrowing"). The final choice to disappear is a high-stakes micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values, foreclosing the path of community aid with a visible cost. The single note of "serene anger" approaches diagnostic label-speak but is quickly anchored in physical sensation ("cold and clean as the stone"), avoiding a major deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds firmly. The inciting incident (eclipse, rockslide, time-stretch) motivates the protagonist's goal, which leads directly to his decisive action. Closure is a clear Decisive Change (disappearing) that is earned by prior causality and carries a felt cost (abandoning his kin). The orientation is immediate and precise, and the plot mechanics are tight and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly specific and deeply integrated into the action and theme. The "wind-carved encampment" and sandstone environment are not merely backdrop; the basin "worn smooth by the gales" is the essential canvas for the disappearing ink, thus constraining the key choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, escalation is driven by Kael's agency. The dominant stake (discovering the source of the time anomaly) is signaled early. Pressure tightens meaningfully as he chooses to pursue the drone over aiding his kin, a choice that narrows his options and forecloses a path with a clear, on-page cost. The final beat is a decisive action, not a coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between the "consciously wild" and the technological "blasphemy." The core concept of time dilation in crisis is explored through specific, dramatized experience rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of Kael hunting "the ghost in the machine," reweighting the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct, controlled, and rhythmic texture that perfectly matches the protagonist's "predator's fluid grace" and "cold" purpose. The POV is stable and deeply embedded in Kael's perception. The voice is confident and specific, with a perceptual signature that avoids exposition or filter-verb clutter. Elision (the mechanics of the ink) is purposeful and taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional. Sentences are propulsive and dense, doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. There is no scaffolding, synonym churn, or repetitive phrasing. Figurative language is sharp and coherent ("light flooded... with a blade's sharp edge"). The read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful, accelerating with the action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sci-fi drone with a quasi-mystical tracker in a post-wild world is fresh and specific. The core concept of using "disappearing ink" as a literal gateway is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its premise, and the choices in voice, setting, and character cohere into a singular, authentic vision without gimmickry.</comment>
