<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's ambition and sensory sensitivity are embodied through concrete micro-choices, particularly her decision to anchor on the seed's scent during the sensory assault. Her final shift to a "quiet partnership" is earned by prior causality, with the cost of endured pain made legible. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the crisis beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final drawing crystallizes her internal shift. Cost is visible in the endured pain and the reconfiguration of her ambition. The pattern of sensory accumulation leads decisively to the still point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The treetop village and the terracotta pot function as micro-settings that actively pressure Elara's choices and focus. The environment's sensory cacophony directly constrains her action, forcing the pivotal internal choice. The final image of the drawing is charged by the specific sensory details of the wind.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: the sensory overload forces a deliberate act of focused endurance. The cost is unmistakable ("Pain bloomed behind her eyes"). The stake—cultivating serenity—is tested and deepened through this coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of finding stillness within motion emerges organically from the specific conflict and is resolved through the non-literal final image of the drawing. The ending offers a resonant reweighting of "serenity" and "ambition" without moralizing, achieving profound emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elara's olfactory perception, creating a distinct perceptual signature. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the emotional pressure of the sensory assault. The lyric compression of the final paragraph is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and sensory density. A minor deduction for a slight repetitive stem in describing scents ("nutty, earthy aroma," "nutty fragrance") which creates a subtle template cadence, though it does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a treetop village, a corpse flower, and hyperosmia feels fresh and inevitable. The central concept of "listening" to non-verbal patterns is executed with high specificity and authenticity, avoiding cliché. The risk of a quiet, internal climax pays off.</comment>
