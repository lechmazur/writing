<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyel's motivation is clear and rooted in consistent traits of feral guardianship and profound homesickness. His internal conflict between duty and desire is embodied in concrete actions, such as his wary handling of the pendant and the final choice to reject the portal. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, with the visible cost of enduring his ache. A minor deduction for a slight abstraction in "dimensional homesickness," but it is quickly anchored in sensory detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure builds through sensory density and Lyel's internal longing until the portal's appearance forces a stance crystallization. Closure is an Earned Stasis—his refusal to leap forecloses a path with the felt cost of continued waiting. The orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and causality remains intact, with the pendant's energy directly enabling the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The frozen garden and mist are not merely atmospheric but function as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Lyel uses the mist's essence to seal the rift, making the environment tactically essential. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting his feral perception and emotional state. The library's "sleeping stones" provide a concrete counterpoint to the portal's violence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lyel's desire for home versus his duty—is signaled early and escalates through the pendant's temptation and the portal's violent opening. Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening reweights the stake, forcing his final agential choice to smother the rift. The cost is legible on the page: he retains his ache but redefines his waiting. No coincidental resolution; pressure coheres to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through events and images—the frozen roses, the pendant's corruption, the sealed rift—rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to homesickness and duty through Lyel's acceptance of the fog. Subtext operates in gestures, like his low growl and the pendant's cold weight. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a feral, perceptive voice that filters the world through Lyel's senses and longing. Diction and syntax reflect his state, such as "interiorizing exteriors" and the rhythmic pulse of the portal's description. Purposeful elision of his past is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures that accelerate during the charge and breathe in reflective moments. Figurative language is precise and voice-motivated, like "a feral thing of sharp senses." No loops, scaffold, or artifactual phrasing. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs, such as the pendant embodying temptation and corruption.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a feral guardian, dimensional homesickness, and a corrupted object feels fresh and inevitable. Tropes are transformed through specific, grounded choices, like using longing as a weapon rather than a passive state. The quiet climax is a bold risk that heightens stakes through emotional complexity rather than spectacle. The core premise commits fully to its implications.</comment>
