<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear, embodied, and intensifies under pressure; his micro-choice with the coins reveals character. The final renunciation of his original goal for a new purpose is earned by prior causality with visible cost ("slumped into his chair... awe").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Kael's purpose shifts from seeking the new universe's vibration to curating the old one's echoes, with cost legible in his awe and the final image of listening. The late prophecy text slightly weakens causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck and the coin collection are vivid, purposeful details that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory selection reflects urgency and POV bias, woven through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens: the risky signal distillation narrows options and deepens knowledge. Cost is felt in the stomach-tightening failure before the breakthrough, though the prophecy's late introduction slightly softens the peak choice's inevitability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of purpose through the conceptual repricing of "uncoin the void." Avoids moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure; POV is stable and voice-apt. Purposeful elision (e.g., the prophecy's late reveal) is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional line-level craft with high information density, varied rhythm, and clear propulsion. Figurative language ("symphony of everything happening at once") is pattern-taught and pays off. Zero loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of cosmic collapse and curation; risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight, with high conceptual integrity.</comment>
