<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and rooted in his role, compelling his choices. His persistent curiosity is shown, not told, through his focused action. Leo's embodied emotion ("face crumpled," "swallow a stone") is specific and credible. The final choice to assure is a micro-choice revealing his values, though the trait "persistently curious" is more demonstrated in setup than tested under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong causal lens: Elias's actions (tuning, tracking, approaching) directly lead to the closure. Orientation is immediate and clear. Closure is a decisive change (Leo's emotional shift) with felt cost (the signal fading signifies a completed, costly transaction). The constraint of the hearing aid's signal shapes his tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is a vivid, pressure-filled environment that isolates the characters and amplifies sound and silence. The hearing aid functions as a crucial micro-setting, its specific properties constraining Elias's method and choices. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting the POV's professional focus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (protecting vulnerable voices) and escalate through Elias's agency in tracking the signal and initiating the confrontation. The cost is legible in the fading of the signal and the emotional weight of the exchange. One meaningful tightening (locating Leo) is sufficient and well-executed under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of connection and peace beyond death emerges organically from the specific premise and action, avoiding direct statement. The final image of the quiet reunion offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The concept of "incidental heroism" is integrated through the character's stance and the story's quiet resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embedded in Elias's professional, technical perception. The voice is distinct, with a controlled, rhythmic prose that modulates effectively with the emotional pressure of the scene. The sparse dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously ("a moth fluttering against a windowpane"). The final line is a masterful, resonant summary that avoids summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise of a "contact tracer for hearts" is a fresh, ingenious synthesis of the supernatural and the technical. It is fully committed to and explored through its specific, grounded particulars (the hearing aid, the method). The emotional truth and specificity avoid genre cliché, feeling both original and inevitable.</comment>
