<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation ("to map empathy onto action") is specific, compelling, and drives his pivotal choice to seek the truth. His internal process is concrete and embodied, particularly when he becomes an "empty vessel" to receive the visions. The final choice to reveal the truth is earned by the causality of his discovery. A slight deduction for the slightly elevated "courageous anomaly" descriptor, which feels more like a narrative label than pure POV thought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred causal lens holds strongly. The closure is a decisive change (DC) from accusation to shared understanding, landing with clear, felt cost in Mara's "weary understanding" and the group's "shuddering sigh." The vision sequence provides a tight because/therefore linkage that cleanly resolves the central conflict. The orientation is immediate and clear within the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated, pressuring the characters' choices and charging the final image. The "lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes" is not just backdrop but a source of constant, tangible danger. The "frost-rimmed apple boughs" and "frozen air" create a cohesive, chilling atmosphere. The micro-setting of the mirror is the key tool that constrains and enables the central action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the causal lens. The stake (community fracture vs. cohesion) is signaled immediately. The pressure tightens meaningfully through Kael's investigative action, which narrows options and changes knowledge decisively. The cost is legible in the emotional release of the final sigh, though the price paid is primarily relational and less concretely tangible beyond that moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the reconciliation of truth and empathy, resisting moralizing. The final image of the "shuddering sigh" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how community endures. The concept of "mapping empathy onto action" is fully dramatized. A minor deduction for the phrase "courageous anomaly," which lightly echoes a thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, measured narrative voice that modulates effectively under pressure ("a force he never questioned"). The prose has a distinct texture and rhythmic control, particularly in the vision sequence. The elision of the exact mechanics of the mirror is purposeful and taught, paid off by the clarity of the visions received.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly crafted, vivid, and propulsive with strong information density. Minor artifacts include a slight repetition of the "weighted breath" motif and the phrase "calmly intuitive," which feels slightly tell-y. The sentence-level rhythm is excellent, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a peacekeeper using a psychic object in a frozen, precarious setting feels fresh and specific. The core concept is well-executed, though the trope of a truth-seeker resolving a dispute is familiar. The story's strength lies in its emotional specificity and execution rather than high-concept premise innovation. The setting and method provide the most distinctive originality.</comment>
