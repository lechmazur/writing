<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("voice a dry rasp"). The final renunciation is earned by the memory trigger, with visible cost in the ghost's dissolving arrogance. A hairline deduction for the brief diagnostic label "chronological confusion" in the opening summary, though it is quickly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through layered memory and object discovery. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Kael integrates his past self, with cost legible in the ghost's "shared, profound sorrow." The camera wheel is the taught pattern that pays off, transforming his purpose from bargaining to bearing witness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and Precipice Platform are vividly rendered and pressure choices. The camera wheel, a micro-setting object, crucially constrains the final choice by triggering the pivotal memory. A minor deduction for the slightly generic "roiling clouds," though it serves the tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification via the discovered object, which deepens knowledge and reweights the dominant stake of regret. The cost is felt in the protagonist's verbal admission of fault. The pressure is coherent, though the escalation is more internal than external, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of ambition's cost emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the camera wheel and the ghost. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "curator of this magnificent failure," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Excellent integration of concept and character arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and controlled, rhythmic prose under pressure ("sound congealed like amber"). POV is stable and deeply internal, with elision (temporal confusion) taught early and paid off at closure with chronological settling. Voice is consistent and highly effective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deduction for a slight density of figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "regret was not a weight anymore, but a release") which, while effective, borders on ornamentation. No loops or scaffolding issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a kinetic carousel world, a ghost, and a disposable camera wheel is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of eroded ambitions is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world, committing fully to its implications. A fresh, memorable perspective.</comment>
