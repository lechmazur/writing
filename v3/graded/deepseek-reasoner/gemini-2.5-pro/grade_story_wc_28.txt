<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, contradictory worldview ("quiet rebellion," "cold, clean peace"). His internal conflict is dramatized through his embodied empathy ("hollow ache of a ghost’s departure") contrasted with his clinical methodology. The final choice to continue his work is earned by the prior causality of his own retrocognitive pain, though his internal state remains slightly abstract compared to the visceral suffering he treats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds. The closure is a decisive change (Joric to Ren) with a resonant reconfiguration of Kaelen's purpose, landing with undeniable cost ("his work was not done"). The mosaic interface is taught early and its mechanics pay off causally. Orientation is immediate and precise ("ancient plaza," "web of crystalline fractures").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is a character that pressures and enables the central action. The "mosaic stepping stone" and "minaret mosaic tessera" are not just described but are essential tools that constrain the choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Kaelen's perception ("air tasting of static and old ash").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Causal lens, pressure escalates through a single, meaningful tightening: the act of renaming, which forecloses Joric's past with a visible cost (his empty calm). The dominant stake (mercy vs. identity) is signaled early and the protagonist's agency drives the resolution, though the escalation is contained within one prolonged action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of mercy as erasure emerges powerfully from the central action and final image, resisting a tidy moral. The core concept ("aberrant mercy") is integrated through specific events, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "Ren" and Kaelen's continued, sad mission.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a controlled, melancholic rhythm ("his voice a study in warm coldness"). The prose effectively reflects Kaelen's state. Minor prose artifacts (e.g., "study in warm coldness" leans slightly abstract) prevent a higher score, but the perceptual signature is strong and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and propulsive with high information density. A minor deduction for a prose artifact: the phrase "a study in warm coldness" is a slightly abstract, telling summary of voice in a key beat. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere with clarity and rhythmic control, and the closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of sci-fi (retrocognition, interface) with a deeply human, philosophical concept (mercy as identity-erasure) feels fresh and inevitable. The core action of "renaming" is a specific, non-obvious angle that transforms familiar tropes of memory and trauma. The story commits fully to its bleak premise.</comment>
