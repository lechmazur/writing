<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is exceptional, with embodied contradiction ("desperate need" vs. "polished emptiness") and micro-choices under pressure (reaching for the pool, pulling back). Her final renunciation is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost ("cold, terrifying clarity").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant Earned Stasis with clear cost ("duty was not to escape... but to stand guard"). Minor deduction for slight orientation delay in first paragraph; anchors solidify by "We leave at dusk."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and functionally essential. The cobalt grotto and bleeding starlight actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, reflecting POV urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly under causal lens from prophetic warning to tangible peril. The grotto's offer forces a decisive choice with clear cost. Agency is demonstrated through Elara's active renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between escape and duty. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the grotto's "beautiful, mindless tapestry."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct with a perceptive, lyrical quality ("stars wept liquid light"). Diction remains within character register even under peak stress. Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deduction for one potential paraphrase loop ("gilded cage" / "polished emptiness") though it serves thematic reinforcement. No artifacts harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Premise feels fresh through specific execution. The bleeding starlight concept is ingeniously realized as both temptation and threat. Transformation of the "disenchanted ruler" trope through grounded, costly choice.</comment>
