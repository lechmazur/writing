<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Finn's characterization is strong, with his resiliently positive nature and deckhand competence driving his choices. His motivation to merge timelines crystallizes from observation, feeling earned. However, the final beat of "permanent transient" feels slightly more thematic than a fully embodied emotional cost from his specific struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive, on-page change (DC) with a clear cost: Finn's newfound, isolating knowledge. The causal lens holds firmly from inciting incident through his active radio manipulation to resolution. The final image of the restored hourglass and his reconfigured purpose provides resonant, felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The spectral grotto is not just backdrop; its crystalline walls, alien starlight, and temporal distortions are the primary source of pressure and the key to the solution. The empty hourglass and erratic clocks are micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from survival to a higher-purpose goal of healing reality. Finn's agency is central, driving the climax through his pattern-matching on the radio. The cost—his altered perception of reality—is legible and poignant, though the final pressure point resolves a bit swiftly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully from the integration of concept and character, exploring the fragility of reality and the cost of awareness. The final image of Finn as a sailor "between the fragile seams" is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Finn's professional, observant perspective. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates effectively with the weirdness of the setting. A minor deduction for a slight register elevation in phrases like "profound silence," but it remains largely voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("like a bead of water skittering off a waxed leaf") is precise and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts obscure causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The concept of a commuter ferry slipping between timelines is brilliantly fresh and executed with full commitment. The synthesis of a mundane setting with high-concept weirdness feels organic and inevitable, transformed through specific, grounded details and Finn's particular worldview.</comment>
