<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, rooted in a legacy of disbelief, and intensifies credibly. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("a name that tasted like a lie"). The final choice to break the seal is a micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values, earning a renunciation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that lands on the page with felt cost ("the hush is mine now"). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density and a cadence shift. A persistent constraint (the legacy of disbelief) shapes the final, charged image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison is a masterclass in micro-setting, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("copperlight repose," "jagged reef"). The environment is inextricable from the plot and theme, a character in itself.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by the protagonist's agency in pursuing the "hush," culminating in the decisive choice to open the door. The cost is legible on the page in the final paragraphs, reweighting the dominant stake of finding a true story.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pursuit of truth versus inherited falsehood. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the suspended men and the protagonist's claimed ownership of the "hush," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with a perceptive, lyrical signature. POV is stable and effectively filters the world. Minor deduction for a slight register elevation in the climax ("trinity of deceit") that, while voice-motivated, slightly clashes with the established lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. A minor figurative muddle occurs in the peak beat ("a sound so terrible it had been stricken from time itself"), which slightly obscures clarity. Otherwise, information density is high and propulsion is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a gothic setting, a psychological character study, and a metaphysical concept feels fresh and inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in voice and world-building, resulting in a singular and memorable piece.</comment>
