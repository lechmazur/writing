<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The poet's motivation is clear and embodied, with micro-choices (taking the feather, weaving the poem) revealing a hierarchy of values. However, the emotional state remains largely serene, lacking the contradictory impulses or internal conflict under pressure that would elevate the characterization to the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost (the snapped kite string symbolizes transience, reconfiguring the poet's understanding). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory density and a cadence shift. A slight deduction for the kite string's late introduction as the primary cost-bearer.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon and the drake's feather function as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply integrated into the POV's perception, creating a palpable atmosphere that is essential to the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive cadence shift (the kite string snap) that reweights the dominant stake of discovering beauty. The cost of transience is legible. Agency is more observational than actively driving the pressure, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of finding harmony in transience emerges organically from the poet's actions and the final image of the feather. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The "woven dawns" concept is integrated effectively as a thematic anchor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the lyrical voice has a distinct perceptual signature, effectively filtering the world through the poet's sensibility. The prose is controlled, though a slight uniformity in the sentence rhythm during reflective passages prevents a top-tier score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight over-reliance on visual description and a few near-synonyms ("burnished hush," "soothing melody") create a subtle decorative loop in the opening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a quiet, reflective moment with the concept of "woven dawns" feels organic and specific. While the premise of an artist finding inspiration is familiar, the execution through particular, grounded details and a cohesive tone provides a fresh angle.</comment>
