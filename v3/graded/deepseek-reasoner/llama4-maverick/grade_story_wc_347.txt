<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The caretaker's motivation is clear and rooted in a mix of duty and empathy, compelling higher-stakes choices as pressure from the labyrinth and mechanical birds rises. Embodied emotion is strong (e.g., "weight... heavy on her shoulders," "shiver run down her spine"), and her final choice is earned by prior causality. A minor deduction for a slight tell in the final paragraph ("sense of pride and satisfaction") which abstracts a state best shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly; the nut triggers the blueprint memory, leading to interpretation and reactivation. Closure is a decisive change (labyrinth reactivated) with cost legible in the urgency to beat the night frost. The orientation is clear within the first 100 words. One hairline slip: the mechanical birds' change of heart is slightly abrupt but does not break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and purposefully constrains choice; the labyrinth's design directly dictates the caretaker's actions, and the night frost is a tangible deadline. Sensory details are selective and filtered through the POV (e.g., "air was thick with dust," "smell of old books"). The cliffside labyrinth and mechanical birds are indispensable, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens: finding the blueprint and enacting its instructions. The dominant stake (guiding travelers) is tested by the mechanical birds and the impending frost, forcing a trade-off of safety for urgency. Cost is legible in the final, successful activation. A minor deduction as the external pressure from the birds could be more actively antagonistic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of transformation from neglect to guidance emerges organically through the reactivation of the labyrinth, resisting a tidy moral. The final image of the beacon of hope is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of purpose. The small nut's gentle glow subtly reweights prior material without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on texture and atmosphere. The voice remains coherent under pressure. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in "offhandedly exact," which feels slightly academic for the POV's internal voice, though it is a required element.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor template cadence emerges in a few sentences starting with "The caretaker..." or "She...", and a slight paraphrase loop occurs with "sense of connection" and "sense of determination." These are minor artifacts that do not touch the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The combination of a cursed orchard, mechanical birds, and a cliffside labyrinth feels fresh and specific. The core concept of a forgotten blueprint as a literal map is a non-obvious angle that transforms a familiar "restoration" trope. The story commits fully to its premise, and the final reconfiguration feels earned.</comment>
