<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Emilia's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her obsession with dust's narrative properties. Her interiority is concrete and particular, shown through her focused actions. However, her characterization is slightly passive; her success feels more like a received revelation than an active, hard-won struggle, which caps the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres through a cadence shift from searching to finding, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the dust animates. The cost is legible in the "expectant" silence and the reconfiguration of the alcove into a portal. The lens holds, though the inciting incident's causality is slightly soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ember alcove and radio dial function as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables the protagonist's choice, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, fully integrated into action and filtered through Emilia's professional and personal priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (teaching dust to tell stories) is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a single, decisive intensification via the broadcast's arrival and the dust's animation. However, the pressure feels largely external (the broadcast arrives conveniently), slightly diminishing the role of protagonist agency in driving the escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges coherently from the integration of music, dust, and narrative, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the swirling, story-telling dust. A minor deduction for the slightly abstract concept of "teaching dust," which leans toward thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature in the prose's lyrical, mist-shrouded texture. The voice modulates effectively with the scene's rising pressure. Purposeful elision (e.g., the song's specific lyrics) is taught and pays off, supporting the accumulative mode without breaking clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor artifact: the phrase "thistled calm" is repeated, creating a slight template cadence. However, this is a purposeful lyric reprise that supports the tone and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The core premise—a copyist using pirate radio broadcasts to teach dust to tell stories—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The combination feels organic and commits fully to its singular vision. The specificity of the ember alcove and the magical properties of dust anchor the concept in lived detail.</comment>
