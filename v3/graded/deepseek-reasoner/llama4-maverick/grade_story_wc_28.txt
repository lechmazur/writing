<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in her gentle radicalism. Her embodied emotion ("felt an unexpected surge of hope") and micro-choice to rename the plaza reveal character under pressure. The final endurance is earned, though interior contradiction could be more pronounced in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural drive lens is clear, with pressure building through sensory and emotional density. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the plaza is conceptually repriced with a "warm coldness," landing with cost. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and purposefully selective, filtered through Aria's perception. The "minaret mosaic tessera" and "chipped patterns" are micro-settings that constrain her choice (to rename) and decisively charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift from observation to declaration. The dominant stake (reclaiming hope) tightens through Aria's agency in renaming, forcing a stance crystallization. The cost is legible in the "warm coldness" that reweights the space.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between past joy and present devastation. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer through "aberrant mercy" and "warm coldness," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Avoids tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice. Diction and rhythm are controlled under pressure ("a coldness that was not quite cold"). Purposeful elision in the retrocognitive vision is taught and pays off, enhancing the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences ("a sense of purpose that drove her forward, even in the face of overwhelming devastation"), but it does not obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-apocalyptic setting with a focus on empathy and reclamation feels fresh. The specific angle on "aberrant mercy" and the "warm coldness" tone are non-obvious and integrated, though the core premise is a familiar archetype transformed by execution.</comment>
