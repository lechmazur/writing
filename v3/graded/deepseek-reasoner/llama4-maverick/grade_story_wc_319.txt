<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The guardian's dimensional homesickness and desire to "make friends with uncertainty" provide clear, compelling motivation that intensifies under pressure. Her internal conflict is dramatized through concrete actions like interiorizing the mist, and her final peace feels earned. However, some emotional states are described with abstract labels ("melancholy mood") rather than fully embodied sensation, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds pressure through dense sensory layering and a cadence shift into reverie, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with clear cost: her peace is paid for by accepting her role. The closure lands on the page with the serene statues and lifted weight, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The frozen garden is indispensable, actively pressuring the guardian's choices and charging the final image. The mist constrains her movement and becomes the medium for her transformation. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the action and thematic concerns, making the setting a primary engine of the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding peace with her duty) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by the guardian's agency in choosing to "interiorize exteriors," a meaningful deepening that changes her knowledge and options under the Accumulative lens. The cost of her transformation—accepting perpetual guardianship—is legible in the final serene image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The theme of embracing uncertainty emerges organically from the guardian's struggle and the library's nature. The final image of the serene statues offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this central question, reweighting the garden from a place of "death and decay" to a "threshold." The pendant's recontextualization from trophy to key deepens the thematic resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture suited to the mystical tone. The voice effectively modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in the reverie sequence. However, a tendency towards slightly elevated, abstract diction ("dimensional harmonics," "foggy lucidity") creates minor register drift that prevents a top score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally lush and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally veers into overwriting, with some synonymous phrasing ("shrouded in a perpetual mist," "foggy lucidity") and a cluster of abstract nouns in peak beats ("dimensional harmonics," "conceptual repricing"). These minor artifacts slightly dull the immediacy of the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core concept of a "feral library guardian" in a mystical, sentient garden is a fresh and specific synthesis. The combination of gothic atmosphere with a philosophical internal conflict feels organic and singular. The story fully commits to its premise, and the resolution feels earned and inevitable, not derivative.</comment>
