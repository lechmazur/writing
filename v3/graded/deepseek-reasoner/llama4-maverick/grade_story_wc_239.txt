<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent desire for cosmic unification. However, interiority lacks concrete, character-particular contradiction; her emotional state is summarized rather than embodied under pressure, leaning on diagnostic language like "her journey inward and outward complete." The final endurance is credible but the internal struggle is told, not shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred, with pressure building through sensory density and cadence shifts. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Aria achieves a charged poise, with cost legible in the "visible or felt cost" of her transformation. The lens holds, though the concept of "spiral arbitration" functions more as thematic echo than causal engine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The temple library and dictionary are vividly rendered and purposefully constrain choice—the dictionary provides the lexicon for deciphering reality. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Aria's urgency, with the environment actively mirroring her internal state. The object charges the final image when returned to the shelf as a sentinel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift into the "resounding hush," reweighting the dominant stake of unification with a felt cost of solitude and transformation. Agency is endurance and attention, foreclosing other paths. Pressure coheres through sensory density rather than causal turns, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of cosmic balance and personal journey, avoiding direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the spiral arbitration as a "journey without end." Subtext operates in silence and implication, though the term "spiral arbitration" itself borders on thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively poetic, with a controlled, rhythmic prose that modulates with emotional intensity. Diction remains within the POV's lexicon, and elision (e.g., the mechanics of "spiral arbitration") is purposeful and taught. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are waived.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally purposeful, but suffers from minor scaffold in adjacent sentences ("In the resounding hush that remained, she knew..." followed by "The witness had done her work...") and a tendency toward abstract nominalizations ("understanding," "balance"). Figurative language is consistent and legible, though dense, without muddling peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic and internal journey feels fresh, and the ancient library setting is grounded in specific, lived detail. The core concept of "spiral arbitration" is intriguing but under-transformed, leaning on thematic resonance rather than fully integrated world logic. Aria's specific perspective is memorable, but the concept's execution lacks risk-taking.</comment>
