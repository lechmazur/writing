<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Emilia's motivation is clear and her curiosity drives the investigation, but the reclusive writer lacks interiority and feels more like a device to deliver exposition. Emilia's final choice to display the locket is a resonant micro-choice, though her internal conflict is understated. The writer's emotional state is summarized rather than embodied in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal drive lens holds: Emilia's inquiry logically leads to the revelation. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the locket's display reconfiguring the courtyard's narrative. Cost is legible in the writer's revealed loss. The only minor slip is the slightly convenient way clues are gathered from residents.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The courtyard and locket are vividly described and serve as anchors. The locket charges the final image, but the setting itself does not actively constrain choices or apply pressure; it remains a largely passive backdrop. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Emilia's perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake (solving the mystery) is clear and escalates through Emilia's agency. The final cost is the emotional weight of the writer's loss, made legible. However, the escalation is gentle and lacks a significant, on-page tightening of options or a dramatic reversal that tests her commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of listening healing emerges organically from the plot and is reinforced by the locket's final display. However, the final paragraph's note ("To those who listen, stories unfold") borders on thematic statement, slightly undermining the earned, implicit resonance. The concept is integrated but could be more complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, observant texture. Dialogue is natural and purposeful when present. The narrative confidently handles elision, such as the days spent reading, without losing clarity. The voice remains consistent and effectively filters the world through Emilia's curator sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive with strong rhythmic control. Information density is high, efficiently advancing character and plot. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "sandstorm calm" is a slightly strained metaphor that doesn't fully cohere with the established tone, but it's a isolated slip.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination of a thrift store curator and a reclusive writer feels fresh, and the locked mailbox is an engaging hook. However, the beats of the investigation and the ultimate reveal of an anonymous admirer are competent but predictable, lacking a truly unexpected or ingenious turn that transforms the premise.</comment>
