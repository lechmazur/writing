<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to seek solace and defy conformity is clear and intensifies under pressure. Internal conflict is shown through the tangible act of untangling threads, and the final change feels earned. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "bodily poetic form" descriptor, which leans toward label-speak without immediate embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory and symbolic density. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as her stance crystallizes. Cost is conceptually legible but lacks a single, visceral on-page moment to anchor the felt price, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The silver courtyard and snowfall create a coherent, pressurized atmosphere. The prism sanctuary functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, though the phrase "alarming serenity" creates a minor tonal contradiction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake (defying conformity) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency in untangling threads, a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. The cost of shedding her past is legible, though its conceptual nature slightly mutes the visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of self-discovery emerges organically through the concrete action of unravelling threads and the prism's transformation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The "harvest of echoes" concept is integrated well, though it borders on thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinctively lyrical. However, register drift occurs in peak beats with phrases like "bodily poetic" and "alarming serenity," which feel slightly elevated beyond the character's immediate perceptual lexicon, creating a minor artifactual effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally elegant and propulsive, but suffers from minor overwriting. The mixed metaphor in "alarming serenity" and the somewhat forced "harvest of echoes" create coherence issues. Figurative language is dense in high-pressure beats without a fully taught pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a courtesan in a snowy courtyard with a prism sanctuary feels fresh and specific. The central metaphor of untangling threads is transformed through grounded action. Risk-taking with a lyrical, accumulative structure mostly pays off, though a few phrases echo common literary templates.</comment>
