<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The curator's curiosity and professional demeanor are consistent, compelling the investigation. However, interiority relies on abstract states ("disquiet," "understanding") rather than specific, embodied emotion under pressure. The final choice to pursue knowledge is motivated but lacks a visible, felt cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory and conceptual density toward a Conceptual Repricing closure. The final realization about nonlinear knowledge reweights the premise with clear cost—the curator's worldview is fundamentally altered. Orientation is clear within the first 100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The astral orchard is vividly rendered and the bathroom's contrasting atmosphere is purposeful. However, the setting primarily functions as atmosphere; it does not tangibly constrain choices or supply resources that alter tactics, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through the curator's active inquiry, culminating in the philosophical breakthrough. The cost is conceptual (a shattered worldview) rather than a visible, felt price, which limits the score under the accumulative lens. Agency is clear but the trade-off is abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of nonlinear knowledge emerges organically from the encounter and the final realization. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing. The pistachio shell serves as a tangible motif that charges the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, slightly formal texture appropriate for a curator. The voice modulates effectively under pressure, maintaining its perceptual signature. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are not evaluated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences describing the curator's state ("brightened disquiet," "sense of purpose"), but it does not obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of an astral setting with a philosophical conceit feels fresh and specific. The core concept of nonlinear inheritance is transformed through the curator's grounded, sensory experience. The risk-taking with the bathroom epiphany pays off and heightens stakes.</comment>
