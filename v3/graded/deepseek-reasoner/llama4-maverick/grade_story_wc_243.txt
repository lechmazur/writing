<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The archivist's interiority is concrete and particular, with a clear, consistent motivation rooted in her professional and emotional connection to the past. Her micro-choices (studying the photo, placing it safely in her bag) reveal her values, though her agency is more observational than decisional, preventing a higher score. The final renunciation/endurance is credible and earned, with a felt cost of melancholic connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure coheres beautifully, building pressure through layered sensory detail and reflection to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the end. The closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—the weight of preserved moments—and the lens holds firmly. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the archivist's perception, creating a rich, melancholic atmosphere. The blooming jetty and twilight glow are purposeful and evocative. However, the environment functions more as a reflective backdrop than a constraint that actively alters her choices or tactics, preventing a top-tier score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (preserving moments) and escalation is achieved through a deepening emotional and thematic intensity under the Accumulative lens, not causal turns. The cost of melancholic connection is legible. The archivist's agency is one of endurance and attention rather than decisive action, which is valid but limits the score's ceiling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges masterfully from the integration of concrete particulars—the locket, the covenant, the act of documentation—without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer on the power of preservation and love's endurance. The final image of the jetty continuing to bloom perfectly encapsulates the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, characterized by a gently thorough, melancholic, and observant quality. The prose rhythm is controlled and supports the reflective tone. There is a slight tendency towards summary in the reflective passages ("she felt a sense of connection"), but it remains character-consistent and does not harm clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor artifacts are present, including a tendency for synonym churn ("haunted euphoria" is repeated) and some slightly decorative phrasing ("walnut-ink archivist"). These do not obscure causality but slightly dilute the line-level precision needed for the highest band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a meticulous archivist, a rediscovered love story, and the theme of preserving small moments feels fresh, specific, and inevitable. The core concept is organic, not a checklist, and the perspective is memorable. The risk of a quiet, reflective narrative pays off with a potent and original closure.</comment>
