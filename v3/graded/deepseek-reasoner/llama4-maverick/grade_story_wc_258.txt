<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cartomancer's motivation ("steadily curious") is clear and consistent, driving her meticulous work. However, interiority lacks embodied contradiction under pressure; her emotional state is described rather than felt through specific, concrete physicality. The final earned stasis (quiet satisfaction) is credible but the cost of her all-night labor is more told than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through density of observation and reflection, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as dawn arrives. The cost of her dedicated study is legible in the final image of her notes as a "map to a hidden treasure," though the felt exhaustion is somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is a vividly rendered, purposeful setting that evolves with the weather and time of day, charging the final image. However, while it provides atmosphere, it does not actively constrain her choices or supply resources that alter her tactics, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's accumulating focus and insight, consistent with the accumulative lens. The dominant stake (understanding hidden patterns) is clear and deepens, but the pressure remains internal and intellectual; a more visceral, felt cost to her pursuit would elevate the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of ancient craft and modern collapse, resisting direct statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting "reverse engineering" as uncovering human narratives. Avoids moralizing, though the thematic connection between cartomancy and crypto crashes could be more deeply dramatized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, analytical voice that filters the world. The prose rhythm is controlled and varies effectively with the contemplative mood. No dialogue is present, so those criteria are waived. The voice successfully carries the accumulative, reflective mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally purposeful, though it occasionally trends toward overwriting ("inherited mystery of the craft was palpable"). Minor synonym churn ("steadily curious," "driven by a desire") and a reliance on abstract nouns slightly dull the texture. The closure image, however, remains clear and effective.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartomancy and post-crypto crash analysis is fresh and specific. The concept feels organic to the character's purpose, not a forced combination. It commits fully to its premise, though the execution leans slightly more on atmosphere than on the full transformative potential of the premise.</comment>
