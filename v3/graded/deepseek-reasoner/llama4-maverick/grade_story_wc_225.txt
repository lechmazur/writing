<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tutor's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in a specific, haunting failure. His "productive fidgeting" is a strong micro-choice that reveals character under pressure. The final renunciation of guilt is earned by the on-page decoding work, though the transition from decoding to instant peace inside the labyrinth feels slightly swift, costing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the tutor finds peace. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, driven by pattern-breaking in the tapestry. Causality is strong until the labyrinth's entrance, where the mechanism for his instantaneous forgiveness is more told than shown, creating a minor but noticeable ellipsis in the most pivotal beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is a masterclass in atmosphere, with sensory details like "scent of wet earth and ozone" creating a palpable, purposeful mood. The tapestry itself functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice and directly charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test with exceptional integration of environment and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (forgiveness) and escalate through the urgent decoding of the tapestry, a meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens. The cost of his past failure is felt, though the pressure momentarily dips upon entering the labyrinth, where the resolution of his internal conflict is achieved with slightly less visible struggle than the setup promised.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete action of decoding, avoiding moralizing. The final image of the village returning to its rhythm while the labyrinth remains is a potent, non-literal answer to the central question of redemption, reweighting the entire narrative with resonant ambiguity about the nature of forgiveness and secrets.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates effectively with the tutor's intense focus. The voice is consistent, though there is a minor register drift into slightly elevated diction in phrases like "winnow the truth," which, while purposeful, slightly distances the reader from the raw immediacy of the character's experience at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is highly evocative and generally concise, with strong rhythmic control. However, a tendency toward dense, figurative language creates minor momentum drag in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a woven hush that wrapped around the tutor like a shroud" followed by more layered description). This artifact slightly obscures the causal clarity of the inciting decoding action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a chess tutor's analytical mind with a tactile, textual mystery is fresh and inevitable. The concept of a "woven hush" and a "platinum labyrinth" transforming a personal quest for forgiveness into a tangible journey is executed with high conceptual integrity and avoids cliché, feeling both original and wholly organic to the story's logic.</comment>
