<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("felt a surge of determination"). The final renunciation of the identity crisis is earned by the on-page meditation. However, the backstory of the ego death and custody battle is summarized rather than fully dramatized, slightly distancing the reader from the core struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a clear before/after change and a felt cost of the journey. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through meditative density. The clone custody battle concept is a potent catalyst but remains largely in the past, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is a vivid, purpose-driven setting that isolates the character and supports the tone. The brain in the jar is a potent recurring object. However, the setting primarily functions as atmosphere; it does not actively constrain choices or supply resources that alter tactics, preventing a top-tier score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, building internal pressure through the practice of complementary opposites. The cost of overcoming emotional numbness is legible and the final peace feels earned. The external stake of the rewriting history complicates but does not fully integrate with the internal conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict of identity versus duplicate. The final image of the brain fading into the background offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of selfhood. The concept is integrated with specific events, though the clone custody battle is more recounted than fully enacted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, meditative texture with controlled rhythm. The narrative certainty matches the focalizer's knowledge. Some minor register drift occurs ("vivify his true self"), but the internal voice remains coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("a sense of peace settle over him, a sense of being fully alive") and a tendency toward abstract nouns ("determination," "clarity"). These do not significantly obscure closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sci-fi clone premise with a meditative, internal journey is fresh and non-obvious. The combination feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. The specific, grounded choice of the brain in a jar as a symbol elevates the concept beyond a simple trope.</comment>
