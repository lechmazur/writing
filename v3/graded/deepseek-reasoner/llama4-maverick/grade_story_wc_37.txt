<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The memory keeper's motivation is clear and consistent, driving her actions. However, her interiority lacks specific contradiction and her final choice is more a passive reception of hope than an active, earned renunciation or change with visible cost, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is clearly held, with pressure building through sensory and thematic density. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the final image of hope is charged by the prior accumulation, though the felt cost of her duty is somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered and deeply integrated. The mica window is a key micro-setting object that actively constrains the protagonist's choice and directly charges the final, hopeful image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency (humming, touching the window) under the accumulative lens, increasing the textual and sensory density. The cost—her continued, never-ending duty—is legible but could be more viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of connection and renewal emerges organically from the imagery and action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of a healing realm, avoiding moralizing. The metaphor "woven dawns" is slightly over-relied upon but remains effective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and effectively filtered through the keeper's perception. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with the emotional intensity of the scene. No head-hopping or clarity issues are present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory detail. Minor issues include a tendency towards slightly abstract language (e.g., "ethereal energy") and the repetitive use of "woven dawns" which, while thematic, edges towards a template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The concept of a memory keeper in a dying mirror world is fresh and compelling. The combination of alchemical, horticultural, and mnemonic elements feels organic and specific, executed with a consistent and authentic vision.</comment>
