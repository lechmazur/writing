<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is clear and rooted in her role, though her internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized. The final choice to create installations feels earned, but the emotional journey lacks the granular, embodied struggle under pressure that would elevate it to the highest tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds, building a resonant reconfiguration of the harbor from loss to hope. Closure lands on the page with a clear, felt cost of collective healing. The structure is coherent, though the final transition to "years later" slightly softens the impact of the immediate closure beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, creating a strong, melancholic atmosphere. The ivory harbor and relics are well-integrated, but they function more as evocative backdrop than as elements that actively constrain the archivist's choices or charge the final image with tangible pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the archivist's agency under the accumulative lens, moving from individual acquisition to public installation. The cost of communal absence is legible and the stake in rebuilding identity is clear. The escalation is more thematic than tactical, foregoing a moment of high-stakes choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully from the integration of fragments into a whole, resisting moralizing. The final image of the harbor as a "beacon" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of loss and remembrance, reweighting the narrative without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and effectively filtered through the archivist's perceptive, slightly poetic consciousness. The voice is distinct and controlled, though it occasionally leans toward a summary tone ("she felt a spark of recognition") that slightly distances the reader from immediate experience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is largely polished and evocative with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a tendency toward abstract summary in key beats (e.g., "she sensed a flicker of understanding") and a few near-synonym phrases ("sense of renewal," "overwhelming urge") that slightly dilute momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The core concept of navigating absences through collected fragments feels organic and specific. The combination is fresh, synthesizing the archivist's role with community healing. It avoids cliché, though the overall arc of post-exile renewal is a familiar template executed with skill rather than transformed.</comment>
