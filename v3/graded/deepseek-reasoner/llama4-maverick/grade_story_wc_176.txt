<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Akira's motivation to preserve forgotten names is clear and consistently drives her actions. Her "technically gentle" trait is embodied in her meticulous work, and her emotional progression from self-forgiveness to purpose feels earned. However, the final emotional state ("peace and accomplishment") is stated with a slight diagnostic clarity that prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds strongly, building through sensory and emotional density to a resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands on the page with clear cost: the transformation of the atmosphere and Akira's palpable satisfaction. The persistent constraint of the rope and card shapes the entire narrative and the final, charged image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and aurora are not merely decorative; they actively pressure Akira's work and infuse the scene with an otherworldly energy that charges the final transformation. The ceremonial rope and punched card function as micro-settings, constraining her choices and becoming essential to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Akira's agency under the accumulative lens, through the increasing density of her focus and the rising energy of the aurora. The cost is legible in the palpable anticipation and the final, satisfying hum that transforms the sanctum. A single, meaningful intensification is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of preserving memory emerges organically from Akira's specific actions and the reconfigured rope's haunting hum. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the transformed atmosphere and sense of connection, avoiding direct statement or moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the prose possesses a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that reflects Akira's focused state. The controlled use of figurative language ("snowmelt ardor") is generally voice-motivated, though it occasionally flirts with register drift, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. However, a few phrases, notably "snowmelt ardor," feel slightly overwrought and introduce a minor register drift that slightly dulls the clarity of the peak beat, though closure remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a lost wax caster, a ceremonial rope, and a punched card to preserve sound is a specific, non-obvious, and highly original concept. The risk-taking with a quiet, accumulative structure pays off, feeling inevitable in hindsight and heightening the thematic stakes.</comment>
