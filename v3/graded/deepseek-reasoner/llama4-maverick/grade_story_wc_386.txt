<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aria's motivation is clear and consistent, compelling higher-stakes choices as pressure rises. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though some emotional specificity could be deeper. The final choice to step out feels earned by prior causality, but the cost of her mission is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the snow globe's pattern holding a hidden message, reconfiguring options with a sense of hope. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with a pattern break (the settled particles) that reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the weight of her task and the promise of connections, though it leans conceptual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The candle-lit ice shrine and melted snow globe are not merely vivid but essential, constraining choice and charging the final image. The snow globe is handled and its evolving state directly shapes the climax. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and fully integrated into action, reflecting the POV's priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aria's agency under the accumulative lens, progressing through the vision to a decisive intensification. The stake to salvage truth is clear, and the cost is legible in the "weight of her mission." A single meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length, though the pressure could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particular image of windows of connection and the wreckage, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the quest for truth. Subtext operates powerfully in the final image of the snow globe's pattern. It embraces complexity without moralizing, though the concept is occasionally echoed in dialogue-like narration ("windows of connection").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and effective, with a distinct perceptual signature and controlled rhythmic prose. The voice is consistent and modulates with emotional intensity. Minor filter verbs ("she sensed," "she felt") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats, but the overall control is strong.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. A slight template cadence emerges in a few consecutive sentences starting with "Aria's..." or "The...", but this is a minor artifact that does not harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diver and ghost-whisperer tropes feels fresh and organic, grounded in specific lived detail. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on connection, and the story commits fully to its implications. The final image feels inevitable and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
