<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The custodian's motivation ("desire to prove that coincidences have meaning") is clear and consistent, driving their actions. The final choice to rekindle the orrery is a credible endurance, though the internal contradiction between their awe and determination could be more embodied in the peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the pavilion sings "a new tune," reconfiguring meaning with a felt cost of immense responsibility. The shard's retrocognitive blessing is a convenient coincidence that complicates but does not resolve, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The pavilion is masterfully rendered as a micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Its vibrations and light actively shape the custodian's path and the climax. Sensory details like the "sweet scent of thistle" are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single decisive cadence shift: touching the orrery reweights the dominant stake (rekindling knowledge) with a visible cost (the surge of light and responsibility). The pressure coheres, though the shard's discovery is more happenstance than agency-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of finding meaning in chaos emerges organically from the custodian's quest and the pavilion's transformation. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—a "world reborn" through hope—that reweights the prior stillness without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical voice. The prose has a strong rhythmic control, though the phrase "thistle-blown optimism" risks register drift into a slightly elevated, poetic diction that feels slightly detached from the custodian's immediate perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, but some overwriting is present. The phrase "a shard of hush fell into their hand" is a mixed metaphor (hush cannot be a shard) that slightly muddles clarity at a key beat. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The combination of a glass humming pavilion, a retrocognitive shard, and star-path tracking feels fresh and organic. The premise offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis of post-apocalyptic renewal and cosmic inquiry, committed fully to its lyrical, hopeful tone.</comment>
