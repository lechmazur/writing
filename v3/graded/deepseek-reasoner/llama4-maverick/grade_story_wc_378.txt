<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to resolve her "inner static" is clear and drives the narrative, with her actions during the burn demonstrating agency. However, emotional states are occasionally summarized with diagnostic labels like "inner static" rather than fully embodied in peak moments, slightly diminishing the rawness of her struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Aria finds "fragmented wholeness" after containing the burn, with the cost legible in the transformed landscape. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, though the "magnetic north" catalyst feels slightly coincidental and under-integrated into the causal fabric.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm is vividly rendered and actively pressures the climax, as the dome amplifies the fire's intensity, constraining Aria's choices. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven through action to heighten tension and charge the final image of renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the controlled burn, which forces Aria to act under the Accumulative lens, narrowing her options and testing her resolve. The cost is visible in the aftermath and her altered emotional state, though the stakes are primarily internal, limiting external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the juxtaposition of the box (fear) and the burn (renewal), culminating in a non-literal resolution of "fragmented wholeness." The ending avoids moralizing, offering a resonant answer through image and action rather than statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical quality that suits Aria's reflective nature. However, minor repetition in phrases like "inner static" and a occasionally elevated register ("miniaturize the chaos") create slight voice leakage under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but suffers from minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "miniaturize the chaos" feels conceptually strained). A few synonym loops ("fragmented wholeness" repeated) and a clunky metaphor slightly obscure clarity at key moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The android caretaker in a glass-domed desert farm is a fresh, specific synthesis. The controlled burn as metaphor for internal catharsis is transformed through character-specific detail, and the story fully commits to its premise without retreating to safety.</comment>
