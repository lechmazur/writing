<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and emotionally embodied, with micro-choices under pressure. However, the "logically emotional" trait is more stated than shown through contradictory impulses acting in scene, limiting the peak of earned resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost on the page ("deep sense of satisfaction"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building density through sensory patterns. Orientation is clear early, and the artifact's safety is a decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered and actively constrains choice (ice creaking underfoot) while charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fully integrated with action and mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with pressure tightening through vibrational matching. The cost is legible in the achieved harmony and foreclosed paths. Stakes are clear and consistently tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of sonic absolution emerges organically from events and images, resisting moralizing. However, the concept leans slightly abstract, and the final answer, while resonant, could be more sharply reweighted by prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature biased toward sonic and tactile detail. No dialogue, but internal voice remains coherent. Minor register drift in "fleshly ethereal" slightly jars the tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally lucid with strong rhythm and sensory density. However, "fleshly ethereal atmosphere" is a mixed metaphor that muddles clarity at a peak beat. Otherwise, minimal scaffolding or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of sonic engineering and sacred artifact protection feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking with ethereal tone pays off, and the core premise is transformed through specific, grounded details.</comment>
