<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gardener's wistfully pragmatic nature is established but remains more observational than active. Interiority is poetic yet risks abstraction, with the lockmaster's backstory feeling more told than dramatized through a micro-choice. The final endurance is credible but the motivation to "reflect light" is more thematic assertion than a choice forged under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred, with closure achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The final image of the pruned rosebush reconfigures the gardener's purpose with a felt cost of quiet endurance. Causality is associative rather than linear, but the pattern of images (flowers, boat, tooth) coheres to land the ending effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The luminous harbor and fire escape function as a potent micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the gardener's reverent perception. The recurring rosebush constrains the initial action (pruning) and symbolizes the closure, though the harbor's pressure on choice is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Escalation is subtle, driven by a cadence shift from wistfulness to purposeful action, reweighting the stake of nurturing hidden beauty. The dominant stake is clear, but the pressure remains internal and ambient rather than concretely tested. The cost is legible as a quiet renunciation of a past life for a present purpose, fitting the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of light/dark, growth/decay, and secrecy/openness. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of nurturing beauty in hidden places. The lockmaster's tooth introduces a counterpoint theme of unlocking secrets, though its integration is slightly less developed than the horticultural metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythm. The voice modulates effectively with the contemplative mood. The single character's perceptual signature is strong, with a consistent, reverent idiom that filters the world through a lens of care and symbolism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. Minor instances of near-paraphrase occur (e.g., "sense of peace" / "sense of purpose"), but they do not significantly impede momentum or clarity. The closure image remains sharp and unburdened by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of gardener and lockmaster motifs is fresh and intriguing, offering a non-obvious angle on urban pastoral themes. The wistfully pragmatic tone feels specific and earned. The concept is slightly limited by the passive observation in the middle beats, preventing a higher score for ingenuity under pressure.</comment>
