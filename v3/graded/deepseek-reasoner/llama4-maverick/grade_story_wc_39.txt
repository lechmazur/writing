<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("joints creaking in protest"). The final choice to write is earned by the preceding reflective beat and the tactile interaction with the jars. A slight deduction for the abstract phrasing "patchwork of lost opportunities," which summarizes rather than dramatizes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is clearly held, with pressure building through sensory details and reflective density. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the poet finds purpose, with cost felt in the "lonesome splendor" of his role. The final image of the dunes reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The feral loft and its contents (music box, glass jars) are not merely described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The poet's interaction with these objects is the engine of the narrative. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully filtered through his melancholic POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from passive reflection to active engagement with his artifacts. The dominant stake (finding purpose/redemption) is meaningfully deepened through his interaction with the jars, leading to the decisive act of writing. Cost is legible in the "lonesome splendor" of his guardianship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the poet's actions with the jars and the music box, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of preserving beauty and memory. A minor deduction for the phrase "gleaned redemption," which edges toward thematic labeling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that reflects the poet's mindset. The perceptual signature is strong, with a consistent, wistful filter. There is a slight risk of overwriting in the density of figurative language, but it remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, a minor deduction for a pattern of stacked modifiers and slightly overripe metaphors ("like a hesitant lover") that, while beautiful, occasionally verge on decorative rather than propulsive. The closure beat remains clear and unaffected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The core concept of a poet capturing sounds is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The combination of specific, grounded details (glass jars, music box) with a universal theme creates a singular artistic stance. The risk-taking in the lyric mode pays off with coherence.</comment>
