<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The peacekeeper's motivation ("to map empathy onto action") is clear and consistently drives her choices, though her internal conflict could be more contradictory and embodied in the moment of discovery. Her calmly intuitive nature is shown through action, but the final choice feels slightly more earned by the process than by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural drive lens is clearly established and held. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands on the page with cost ("the burden of her role as guardian") and is earned through the meditative process of piecing together reflections.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and purposeful, with the lighthouse mirrors and crystal actively constraining and enabling the protagonist's choice. The lighthouse orchard and ice floes provide a strong atmospheric pressure, though the environment's physical impact on tactics is more suggested than fully leveraged.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive cadence shift and density increase as the protagonist pieces together the crystal's pattern. The dominant stake of maintaining balance is reweighted by the successful reconstitution, with a clear cost in the burden of her role felt at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of mapping empathy onto action emerges organically from the protagonist's goal and the central act of reconstitution. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the pulsing crystal, reweighting the prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with a strong perceptual signature. The voice modulates effectively with the meditative pace, and any elision feels purposeful and taught. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and sensory density. Minor issues include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some beats ("whispers of the frozen sea") and a near-paraphrase loop between "mapping empathy onto action" and "shifting landscapes of the heart," but these do not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The combination of a "shadow-laced peacekeeper" and a "lighthouse orchard" above "shifting ice floes" creates a fresh, memorable synthesis. The core concept of a "courageous anomaly" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in the character's goal and the world's logic.</comment>
