<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sentinel's "calmly inventive" trait is a consistent anchor, and her micro-choices under pressure (deciphering the code, activating the mechanism) are credible. However, her motivation to "spark a silent revolution" is more told than felt, and the immediate camaraderie with the revealed conspirator lacks the friction or embodied contradiction that would elevate this to a higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The causal lens holds strongly from the blackout inciting incident to the sentinel's decisive action. Closure is a clear Decisive Change (activating the cradle) that reconfigures the fort's state with a visible cost—the glow reveals the conspirator and begins the revolution. The only minor slip is the overly smooth, frictionless alliance formed at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "luminous fort at twilight" and the "cradle of sparks" are vivid, purposeful details that charge the final image. The blackout effectively pressures choices. However, the setting occasionally slips into generic description ("ancient stones," "otherworldly glow") rather than consistently filtering through the POV's specific, professional perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation is coherent and driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: the blackout creates pressure, the coded message presents a puzzle, and her decision to activate the cradle is the key turn that narrows options and sparks the revolution. The cost—committing to a dangerous rebellion—is legible, though its personal weight could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of revolution against stagnation emerges organically through the artifact and the conspirator's actions, not direct statement. The final image of the glowing cradle as a "beacon of hope" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. It is slightly weakened by the label "silent revolution" being used explicitly within the narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable and effectively close to the sentinel's perception. The prose has a distinct, slightly elevated texture fitting the setting. Some phrases, however, verge on cliché ("spreading like wildfire," "set the revolution ablaze"), creating minor voice convergence at emotional peaks and preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose is generally clear and functional but is hampered by repetitive phrasing and synonym churn (e.g., "silent revolution" appears three times, "calmly inventive" is repeated). This creates a template cadence that dulls momentum and slightly obscures the closure image, though the core causality remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The combination of a guarded artifact, a coded message, and a blackout in a ancient fort feels organic. The core concept is a fresh synthesis, though the execution leans on familiar archetypes (the watchful guardian, the mysterious ally). The lack of a bold, specific risk in the protagonist's final choice limits the score.</comment>
