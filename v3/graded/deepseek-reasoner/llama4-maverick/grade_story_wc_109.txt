<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The oracle's obsession is well-embodied and her motivation to map the night is clear, driving the narrative. However, the final choice to step into the darkness, while thematically resonant, lacks a visible, on-page internal conflict or micro-choice that demonstrates a credible struggle or cost at the moment of decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres through a decisive cadence shift into profound silence, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The cost, however, is conceptual and felt rather than concretely visible on the page in a single sentence, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory detail is exceptionally vivid, selective, and purposeful, perfectly woven into the POV's perception. The ridge fort and storm function as a micro-setting that pressures the initial choice to begin the narrative, and the final transformed darkness charges the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the oracle's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from listening to speaking to stepping out, with a clear cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. The cost is felt and conceptual, though its legibility is slightly attenuated by the lyrical prose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The theme of mapping the ineffable emerges organically through concrete action and image, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. The final image of a rearranged world offers a profound conceptual repricing without moralizing, though the "ambered hush" motif is slightly over-relied upon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a controlled, lyrical rhythm that modulates perfectly with the rising pressure. The purposeful elision of standard causality is taught early and paid off at closure, creating a coherent and powerful perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "words dripped like honey"), which, while beautiful, creates a mild density drag without a clear pattern payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mystical oracle and a cosmic, almost scientific cartography of silence feels fresh and specific. The lyric mode is a bold risk that largely coheres, though the concept hews closely to familiar mystical tropes, preventing a top-tier score for originality.</comment>
