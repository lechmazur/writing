<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character is vividly drawn with specific micro-choices and a clear, evolving motivation. The final choice to arrange treasures and withdraw is earned, though the internal contradiction between their reclusive nature and desire to be seen could be more sharply dramatized under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the dweller's renewed purpose and the patrons' dawning awareness create a before/after shift. The cost of their continued isolation is felt in the final image of them melting away.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory detail is exquisite and purposeful, deeply filtered through the dweller's POV. The library is a character, though it does not decisively constrain a pivotal choice, preventing a higher score. The "sapphire hush" is a particularly effective tonal image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes of visibility are clear. Escalation is driven by the memory trigger, a textural deepening that reweights the dweller's purpose and urgency. The cost of their hidden labor is legible, though the pressure could feel more immediate and constricting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory and visibility emerges organically from the tape fragment's discovery and its consequences. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of hidden treasures and whispered rumors, perfectly avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is exceptionally stable and distinct, with a perceptive, methodical voice that modulates beautifully under emotional pressure. The prose is consistently filtered through the dweller's specific lexicon and perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and rhythmic with high information density. A minor instance of scaffold phrasing ("kindly methodical soul") appears twice, and the simile "like stars" is slightly generic. Otherwise, line-level craft is exemplary and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The combination of a hidden caretaker and sense memory as a plot trigger feels fresh and specific. The concept is executed with integrity, though the core premise of a library dweller is a familiar trote, albeit transformed here through particularity.</comment>
