<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The undertaker's motivation is clear and rooted in his profession and weariness. His internal conflict and embodied emotion are effectively shown, particularly in his "inexplicable pull" and the peace he finds. His final choice to remain as guardian feels earned by the causality of his journey and actions. The trait "inadvertently stubborn" is mentioned but not deeply integrated into his on-page micro-choices under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal lens holds strongly from the inciting incident (receiving the package) through the climax (reactivating the signal). The closure is a clear and resonant Earned Stasis, with the cost of his commitment to remain as guardian felt in the final paragraphs. The orientation is immediate and clear, and the structure of a single, continuous journey is well-executed for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a major strength. The underwater library is vividly rendered and actively pressures the protagonist's choices, from navigating its corridors to the central act of repairing the transmitter. The broken lighthouse lens is a key object that constrains and enables the central action, charging the final image of the pulsing signal. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, enhancing the eerie atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds effectively through the preparation and descent, culminating in the decisive act of repairing the device. The dominant stake (finding rest/peace) is clearly signaled and meaningfully deepens. The cost is legible in his commitment to remain, forever altering his life. The escalation is driven by his agency, though the middle journey feels slightly efficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully from the integration of character, setting, and action. The concepts of rest, stillness, and sanctuary are explored through concrete particulars rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the library from a "tomb" to a "beacon" and a "resting place not just for the dead, but for the living as well."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person POV is stable and effectively filtered through the undertaker's perception. The voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical, melancholic tone suited to the subject matter. The prose successfully maintains this voice under pressure. There is a minor tendency toward slightly abstract phrasing (e.g., "occupying the impossible spaces") that very slightly distances the reader from pure immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is generally strong, with good rhythm and purposeful description. However, minor line-level artifacts prevent a higher score. There is some synonym churn ("weary," "worn down," "relentless") and a reliance on filter verbs like "felt" and "seemed" in key beats (e.g., "The undertaker felt a sense of peace"). These small choices slightly dull the immediacy of the high-pressure closure moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of an undertaker, a lighthouse lens, and an underwater library is highly original and feels organic, not checklist-driven. The core concept of a distress signal for a library is a fresh, non-obvious angle. The story commits fully to its premise, and the emotional truth of seeking stillness resonates powerfully. The combination is memorable and specific.</comment>
