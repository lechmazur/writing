<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Characterization is strong with clear motivation rooted in transformative hope. Aria's interiority is concrete and embodied, though her internal conflict is more reflective than actively contradictory in-scene. The final choice (completing the tapestry) is earned, but the cost of her labor is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the tapestry glows at dawn, reconfiguring the labyrinth's meaning. Cost is legible in the "weight of her task" and the transformation of space. One tightening occurs as her weaving takes on a life of its own, narrowing her focus to completion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth is indispensable, constraining Aria's existence and charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and filtered through her POV. The environment functions as a micro-setting that pressures her choices and mirrors her inner world, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through the increasing density and luminous intensity of the weaving process, which reweights the stake of transformation. Protagonist agency drives the escalation, and the cost is the tangible burden of creation. A single meaningful deepening is sufficient and well-executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the weaving act and the final image, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to repairing a broken world. Subtext is rich in the tapestry's glow representing distilled essence. The ending avoids moralizing, though the concept of "reverence" edges toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, poetic, and consistent. The lyrical compression is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping. The perceptual signature is strong, though the register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("orchid solace") that slightly distances the reader from immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with good rhythm and variety. However, minor artifacts appear: a synonym loop ("weave" / "sew" / "craft") and occasional register drift into abstract nouns ("precedents," "reverence") that slightly dull the tactile immediacy of the weaving process, though closure remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a weaver in a labyrinth transforming ruin is fresh and specific. The concept feels organic, not checklist-driven. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyrical mode pays off with a coherent closure. The high score reflects the singular vision, though it doesn't quite reach the highest band of inevitability.</comment>
