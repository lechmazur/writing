<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aria's characterization is strong, with her pacifism and perceptive nature embodied through concrete action (tending roses, rejecting the sword). Her motivation to "weave continuity through chaos" is clear and drives her choices. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on summary for her internal conflict, though her final stance feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Earned Stasis, legible as Aria reaffirms her path with visible cost (the sword as a relic). The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory detail and reflection. The orientation is clear within the first paragraph, establishing who, where, and when effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glass-domed farm is a vivid, purpose-driven setting that pressures Aria's choices by defining her sanctuary. Sensory details are selective and filtered through her POV. The sandbag planter and the sword on the wall are key objects that charge the final image, constraining her choices and symbolizing her path.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (creating a sanctuary) are signaled early. Escalation under the accumulative lens is a gradual deepening of Aria's conviction rather than a causal tightening. The cost of her renunciation (the path not taken) is felt, though the pressure could be more acute to reach a higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of the violent past (sword, ruined city) and the cultivated present (roses, quiet). The final image of the "tranquil blaze" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to build peace from chaos, without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Aria's perceptive, serene consciousness. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with the calm atmosphere. A minor deduction for occasional repetitive sentence structures ("Aria moved...", "Aria would welcome...") that slightly dull the voice's distinctness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally lush and purposeful, but suffers from some repetition and synonym churn (e.g., "serene dedication," "serene world," "tranquil blaze," "soothing presence"). This creates a slight looping effect that, while thematically appropriate, marginally reduces momentum and clarity, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-apocalyptic setting with a pacifist plant-cultivator is a fresh, non-obvious angle. The core concept of "engraved quiet" is integrated thoughtfully rather than as a gimmick. The story commits fully to its serene, accumulative vision, taking a bold risk that largely pays off.</comment>
