<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fisher's cool-headedness is a consistent, embodied trait that motivates her focused search, and her final act of "voicing silence" is an earned, character-specific choice. However, the interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, leaning more toward a singular, focused determination without internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, achieved through the pattern-breaking of the constellations and the fisher's final, decisive act. The cost is legible in the "spent" energies of the garden and the fisher's "renewed" spirit, a tangible exchange. The lens is taught early and held consistently through accumulating sensory details and pattern shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is not merely a backdrop but an active, pressure-exerting participant that constrains and enables the fisher's goal. Its unique properties are the direct mechanism for the climax ("voicing silence") and its "otherworldly energy" charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's goal-oriented action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the fisher's agency under the Accumulative lens, as her deliberate actions (zigzag walking, transliterating, voicing silence) intensify the garden's response and narrow her path to the climax. The cost is the garden's "spent" energy, a visible price for the connection achieved. A single, meaningful tightening from search to receptive stillness is sufficient and well-executed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of seeking connection in silence emerges organically from the specific, concrete particulars of the garden and the fisher's methods. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the lingering "feral lullaby," reweighting the initial search without moralizing. It embraces complexity, suggesting the pursuit is ongoing and the cost of connection is real.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with a controlled rhythm that modulates with the rising pressure. The voice is consistent, though the perceptual signature, while strong, occasionally verges on a slightly over-uniform poetic register ("sleepwalking constellations," "feral lullaby") that slightly flattens the character's individuality at peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. There is a minor tendency toward decorative phrasing ("sleepwalking constellations," "feral lullaby") that, while beautiful, creates a slight textural density in peak beats without adding causal pressure. The sentence-level propulsion, however, remains clear and advances the story effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a "sound wave garden" and a "cool-headed fisher" seeking a goddess through silence is a fresh, specific, and organic concept. The risk-taking in the accumulative, almost lyric structure pays off with a coherent and legible closure. The concept commits fully to its implications without retreat, resulting in a singular artistic stance.</comment>
