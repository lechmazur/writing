<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("tension in her shoulders ease"). Motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling higher-stakes choices. The final endurance is earned, though the lack of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a single scene prevents a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is taught and held. Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing, landing with clear cost in the final paragraph's "auroral sorrow" and the reconfiguration of truth as "provisional and ephemeral." Orientation is immediate and the pattern of accumulating notes pays off decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and supplies resources (data, logbook). The botanical illustration is a recurring object that charges the final image, constraining Aria's focus and symbolizing her journey, qualifying for the 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Aria's agency under the Accumulative lens—her act of "smudging" the logbook and collaborative research deepens the stakes. A single, meaningful cadence shift occurs as the "weight of the swallowed truth" begins to reveal itself, reweighting the dominant stake with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of provisional truth emerges organically from events and the central image of the illustration. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. The "auroral sorrow" is an earned emotional aftereffect, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, controlled texture. The perceptual signature is strong, filtered through Aria's specific way of noticing. A minor register drift occurs with the slightly decorative phrase "auroral sorrow," preventing a higher score, but the voice remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor artifact is the phrase "auroral sorrow," which feels slightly elevated and decorative for the POV's lexicon in the peak beat, applying a small deduction. Otherwise, clarity and momentum are excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of an oracle in a scientific setting feels fresh and organic. The core concept of "swaying certainties" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The bold risk of a quiet, conceptual closure pays off with coherence and meaning.</comment>
