<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Luna's motivation is clear and rooted in her dual identity as artist-scientist, compelling higher-stakes choices as she explores the geode. Her internal conflict is shown through somatic markers and affectionate skepticism, though her emotional state occasionally veers into summary ("willowglass hope") rather than fully embodied contradiction under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—Luna's newfound clarity and hope are earned through the static shock and somatic markers. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory density. However, the telepathy pill recall concept is underutilized, creating a minor causality break as it is mentioned but doesn't actively shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The light painting studio and muscovite geode sliver are masterfully integrated, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details (linseed oil, turpentine) are selective, purposeful, and filtered through Luna's POV, creating a cohesive atmosphere that mirrors her internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Luna's agency under the Accumulative lens, using somatic markers and the geode to deepen her exploration. The static shock serves as a meaningful tightening, recalibrating her perception with visible cost. However, the stakes remain somewhat internalized, lacking external pressure to test her resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the geode's fractally precise structure and Luna's somatic markers, exploring connections between art, science, and consciousness. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, and the recurring image of the geode shifts meaning to charge the closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Luna's artistic-scientific mindset. However, some sentences are overly complex, and occasional filter verbs ("Luna felt") dilute immediacy. The prose remains legible and purposeful, supporting the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and generally concise, with strong sensory detail and varied syntax. Minor issues include repetitive stems ("Luna's somatic markers...") and a slight overuse of figurative language in peak beats ("sea of mental images"), but clarity and momentum are maintained, and closure is unaffected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of artistic and scientific exploration feels fresh and inevitable, with the geode serving as a unique catalyst. Risk-taking in blending internal somatic markers with external light painting heightens stakes, though the telepathy pill recall element is less transformed and feels somewhat derivative.</comment>
