<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lena's characterization is strong, with her decisively kind touch and professional focus embodied in her actions. Her motivation to "execute a flawless goodbye" is clear and drives the narrative. However, her internal conflict is somewhat summarized rather than dramatized with contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory and emotional density. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Emma's peaceful passing) with a clear, felt cost on the page ("a soft smile on her lips"). The structure is coherent, though the inciting incident (blood work results) is reported rather than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful. The "radiant haven" and its sensory details (scent of flowers, hum of choirs, candlelight) are filtered through Lena's POV and actively contribute to the atmosphere of peace. The broken vinyl record functions as a micro-setting, charging the final image with new significance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake (achieving a peaceful transition) is clear. Escalation is driven by the blood work revelation, narrowing Lena's options and focusing her tactics. The cost is legible in Emma's slowing breath and final smile, a trade-off of life for peace earned through Lena's agency in weaving the soundscape.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of music's transcendent power emerges organically from the specific action of "hymning the mundane." The final image of the shining vinyl shard offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The concept of "scent of hope" is slightly overt but is effectively integrated into the sensory landscape.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filtered through Lena's professional, compassionate perspective. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture appropriate to the tone. Some sentence stems are slightly repetitive ("soft" is overused), but the voice remains coherent and controlled under emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with vivid, purposeful description. Minor issues include a slight overuse of the word "soft" and some near-paraphrase loops (e.g., "gentle touch," "gentle choirs," "gentle cadence"). However, these do not significantly obscure clarity or momentum, and the closure beat remains clean and powerful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of hospice care, music therapy, and a "radiant haven" is a fresh, organic synthesis that avoids cliché. The execution is grounded in specific, lived detail. While the core concept is strong, the resolution is emotionally predictable, lacking a truly unexpected inflection that would elevate it to the highest band.</comment>
