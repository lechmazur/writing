<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation ("morbid curiosity") is clear and intensifies, but interiority relies on summary rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The final change is felt, but the whispering advisor's influence blunts the protagonist's agency, making the final endurance feel slightly less earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred, building pressure through sensory density. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a felt cost ("forever marked"). However, the whispering advisor's voice acts as a deus ex machina, breaking causality by providing unearned knowledge and guidance, particularly at the climax ("Look closely, and you shall see").</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The funhouse setting is vividly rendered and permeates the narrative with a strong, consistent atmosphere of decay. It successfully pressures the protagonist's choices. While it charges the final image, it does not quite constrain a pivotal choice to cross the 9.0 threshold.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven effectively by the protagonist's curiosity under the accumulative lens, building to a clear climax. The cost of the experience is legible on the page ("feeling changed, forever marked"). The score is capped due to the causality break from the external advisor, which undermines the purity of the protagonist's agency in driving the escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of repulsive allure and confronting fear emerges organically through the imagery and events, resisting a tidy moral. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final, haunting image of the model and the whispered warning, successfully reweighting the narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, atmospheric texture with a controlled rhythm. The whispering advisor's dialogue is the sole weak point, feeling slightly more like a narrative device than a naturalistic voice, but this is a minor flaw in an otherwise strong vocal performance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, but suffers from minor overwriting and a template cadence in places (e.g., "The whispering advisor's voice..." is a repetitive stem). These artifacts are present but do not critically obscure the closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The combination of a cursed photograph and a haunted funhouse feels fresh and is executed with specificity. The core concept is committed to and followed through to its chilling conclusion, resulting in a memorable and effective synthesis.</comment>
