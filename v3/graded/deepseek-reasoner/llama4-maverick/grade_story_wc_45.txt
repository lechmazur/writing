<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emilia's characterization is strong, with clear motivation rooted in her "forgiving skeptic" nature. Her internal conflict between nostalgia and innovation is embodied and drives the final choice. The final renunciation of doubt is earned by the tooth's discovery and subsequent reflection, though the epiphany leans slightly toward summary near the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens fits best, with pressure building through reflective density and a final cadence shift. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she crystallizes her purpose. The cost is legible in her foreclosed path of doubt, though the final image's conceptual cost is slightly abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The secret garden is vividly rendered and serves as a catalyst, but it functions more as atmosphere than a constraint that actively pressures choices. The tooth is a stronger micro-setting element, charging the final image but not decisively altering tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from curiosity to a crystallized sense of purpose. The dominant stake (making sense of past events) tightens through reflective deepening. A visible cost is paid in the renunciation of her skeptical doubt, charging the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of transforming mistakes into beauty emerges organically from the tooth's symbolism and the bone setting metaphor. It offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image successfully reweights prior material, though the thematic statement "turn mistakes into constellations" is slightly explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature. The prose effectively modulates between wonder and shrewd observation. The reflective passages are well-integrated, anchored in the present by the tooth, and tilt her stance. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight paraphrase loop ("sense of purpose begin to take shape" / "sense of purpose and direction") and some elevated diction ("groundbreaking") that feels slightly out of step with the voice. No major obscurities.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The combination of a changeling's tooth and bone setting art feels fresh and specific. The synthesis is organic and inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of a "cleft in certainty" is transformed through grounded, character-specific choice rather than remaining abstract.</comment>
