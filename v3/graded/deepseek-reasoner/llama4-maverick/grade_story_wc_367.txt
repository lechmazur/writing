<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The herald's motivation is clear and her interiority is concrete and particular, rooted in ancient tradition. Her joy and sense of purpose are embodied, and her final, shadowed elation is a credible emotional state. The final choice to continue the cycle is an Earned Stasis, foreclosing a path with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing the herald's purpose and the cyclical nature of her work with a felt cost of responsibility. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through density and cadence shifts. The final image of the lighthouse as a sentinel reweights the prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and glass lantern function as a micro-setting that directly constrains and enables the herald's crucial choice to bend the light. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, filtered through her joyful, ritualistic POV. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout the ascent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the herald's agency under the Accumulative lens, building through the careful adjustments of the lantern to a final, decisive gesture. The cost of her responsibility is legible on the page, charging the final image. The dominant stake of steering the dawn is clear and tightens meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of preserving tradition in a digital age emerges organically from the herald's actions and the world's state. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the cyclical, never-ending dance of light and shadow. It avoids moralizing, though the concept is occasionally echoed as theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the herald's movements and the building energy. There is no head-hopping, and the controlled elision of the world's details serves the focused narrative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly controlled with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor issues include a slight over-reliance on light/shadow imagery in some beats and a few near-synonym phrases ("coalescing into a new reality"). However, these do not obscure causality or dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The core concept of an "Otherworldly routine" steering the dawn is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of tradition and magic. The combination feels organic and specific to this voice and setting. The risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative mode pays off with coherence and meaning.</comment>
