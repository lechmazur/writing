<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The artist's internal conflict is embodied through the mandala's creation, and her final resolution feels earned. However, her "socially perceptive" trait is told rather than shown, and her agency is more reactive than proactive, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pressure building through sensory and pattern density. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a clear cost in the lingering "lilac unease." The tile flake's arrival is a minor coincidence but complicates rather than resolves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto and mist are exquisitely rendered and function as a micro-setting that actively pressures the protagonist's perception and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and deeply integrated with the POV's state of mind.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (discovering meaning) and escalation is driven by the accumulative pressure of the environment and the mandala's emerging patterns. The cost is legible in the final, uneasy peace. A single meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the artist's struggle. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of finding meaning. The repetition of "lilac unease" slightly edges toward thematic echo but avoids outright moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates effectively with the emotional intensity. The perceptual signature is strong, though a slight over-reliance on similar sentence structures for description ("The mist...", "The sand mandala...") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but suffers from minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "The sand mandala was a reflection..." is nearly repeated) and a tendency toward decorative phrasing ("lilac unease") that slightly muddles clarity in peak beats without fully obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The combination of a sand mandala in a whispering grotto feels fresh and specific. The core concept of "emergent hush" is integrated well, transforming a familiar internal journey into a singular, atmospheric artistic stance. The risk-taking with tone is effective.</comment>
