<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong embodiment of emotion and a clear, consistent motivation. However, the characterization lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene that would elevate it to the highest band; her eccentricity is stated but not shown through internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a felt cost of solitude and effort. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through density and cadence shifts. A minor deduction for a slight lens ambiguity; the causal link between her calculations and the stories' reawakening is more asserted than shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully woven into the POV's perception, creating a rich atmosphere. The setting is integral to the concept. Score is capped below 9.0 as the environment, while evocative, does not concretely constrain a choice or decisively charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, with urgency increasing through her work. The cost of her solitary effort is legible. The stake—reawakening stories—is clear, though its test remains internal and the tangible pressure from the external world (patrons) is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme of stories as living entities emerges organically from the librarian's specific actions and the library's nature. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of pulsing analog memories, reweighting the prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that fits the character and concept. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "observed solitude" is repeated, creating a slight template cadence that slightly dulls the effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory density. A minor deduction for a paraphrase loop: "countless hours she'd spent" appears twice in close proximity, creating a small scaffold artifact that slightly reduces momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The core premise—a librarian using hyperbolic geometry to map narrative spaces—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of ideas. The combination feels organic and committed, resulting in a singular artistic stance that avoids cliché.</comment>
