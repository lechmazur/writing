<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with micro-choices like opening the safe revealing character. Interiority is concrete, though emotion could be more embodied in peak beats. The final endurance feels earned, but a slight diagnostic tone in "kinship with ancient scholars" prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, building pattern density toward a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The cost is legible in the "fleeting instant of beauty" and the artist's departure. Linkage between the coin's message and the artist's action is slightly implied rather than fully causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tree trunk library constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory detail purposefully filtered through the artist's perception. The setting pressures the narrative through its imminent demolition, and the "dappled shadows" and "indigo sky" are integrated into action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing beauty against time) escalates through the live clock of demolition, narrowing options. Agency is demonstrated through the artist's focused craft despite external pressure. Cost is felt in the "poignant reminder" of loss, though the external threat remains passive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transience vs. permanence emerges organically through the coin's message and the library's fate. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the mirrored sky. Subtext operates in the artist's quiet reverence and the coin's topography.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature, though some diction ("fractally precise," "quixotic") feels slightly elevated for the character. Rhythm controls pressure well, and elision (e.g., the subject's identity) is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful, but minor overwriting occurs (e.g., "fractally precise renderings" risks ornamentation). Figurative language ("mirror the sky") is coherent and supports closure. No significant loops or artifacts harm momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The combination of face-blind artist and tree trunk library is fresh and organic. The core concept of discovering limits through tactile coin reading is innovative. The closure's charged poise feels earned and heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
