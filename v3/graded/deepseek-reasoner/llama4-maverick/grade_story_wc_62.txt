<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The carver's meditative focus and embodied grief are concrete and compelling, particularly in how her hands move with precision despite inner turmoil. Her final realization about collective grief feels earned through the spectral interaction and sensory details. However, the motivation to "discover the shape of collective grief" is stated rather than fully dramatized in her choices, preventing a higher score. The spectral mentor provides effective secondary pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the carver's insight reconfigures her understanding of grief, landing with cost in the final image of butterflies. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building through sensory and symbolic density. A minor deduction for the ghost's appearance, which, while thematically rich, lacks a clear causal trigger within the scene's established logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse is a masterful micro-setting, actively constraining and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the carver's POV—the misty veil, scent of flowers, and lunar glow all contribute to atmosphere and theme. The environment evolves with the fading light, and the headstones are integrated into the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates effectively through a cadence shift and density increase, culminating in the ghost's appearance and the unspooling of the ribbon. The dominant stake (understanding grief) is reweighted with a visible cost—the weight of her grief begins to shift. The ghost complicates the situation, and the carver's recitation is an act of agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of death (gravestones), life (butterflies), and memory (ribbon, poem). The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of collective grief without moralizing. The spectral mentorship concept is fully integrated into the thematic exploration rather than existing as a prompt label.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through the carver's perceptual signature—her professional and personal priorities shape what she notices. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in phrases like "fiercely meditative," which feels slightly external to her immediate internal state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("The sun's final rays dissolved into the ancient greenhouse's misty veil"). Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful. One minor paraphrase loop exists ("a sense of peace" is used twice near the ghost's appearance), but it does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and butterfly migration is fresh and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is committed to fully and executed with high emotional specificity, avoiding generic templates. It earns a within-band bonus (+0.2) for risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though the ghost element slightly echoes a familiar trope.</comment>
