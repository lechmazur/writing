<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The poet's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied contradiction ("furiously tranquil"). However, the final choice to read the letter feels more like a foregone conclusion than a high-stakes decision earned by escalating pressure; the agency is passive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the poet's understanding is reconfigured. The cost is legible in the final image of navigating darkness. Orientation is immediate and the pattern of internal/external turbulence is taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vividly rendered and atmospherically potent, mirroring the internal state. However, it functions more as a mirror than a constraint; it doesn't actively pressure choices or supply resources that alter the protagonist's tactics, limiting its functional impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through the storm's density. The escalation is driven more by atmospheric accumulation than protagonist agency, and the cost, while felt, is not sharply articulated through a decisive, agential trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central concept of mapping internal scars. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this quest for understanding, reweighting the darkness from oppressive to navigable without moralizing. The cartography motif is fully integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a strong perceptual signature ("storm-kissed wonder"). The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the emotional intensity of the storm. Purposeful elision (the letter's contents) is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor deductions for occasional dense figurative clusters ("maddening vortex of sound and sense") that slightly slow momentum in high-pressure beats, but clarity and propulsion are largely maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a censored poet, a stormlit vigil, and internal cartography feels fresh and organic. The core concept is specific and fully committed to, though the execution of some elements (like "rarefy") leans slightly toward the decorative rather than the indispensable.</comment>
