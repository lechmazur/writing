<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The janitor's interiority is concrete and reverent, with a clear, consistent motivation rooted in spiritual curiosity. However, the characterization lacks significant internal contradiction or a hierarchy of values revealed under pressure; the emotional state is one of consistent, unwavering awe.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the lantern glass is reweighted. The closure lands with a felt cost of quiet endurance and newfound purpose. The "overlooked era" timeframe is a vague anchor, slightly weakening the initial orientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the janitor's POV, creating a strong atmosphere. The station and the lantern glass function effectively as micro-settings, with the glass charging the final image. However, the station itself does not actively constrain choices or supply resources that alter tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a cadence shift towards meditative stillness, reweighting the dominant stake of finding purpose. The cost of this quiet endurance is legible. However, the escalation is gentle and lacks a significant, agency-driven tightening or a foreclosed live option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of character, setting, and object, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of strength in vulnerability. The final image of the talisman successfully reweights prior material without moralizing, though the phrase "primal elegance" edges towards thematic statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, meditative texture with controlled rhythm. The janitor's perceptual signature is strong and consistent. Some minor register drift occurs with phrases like "primal elegance" and "flourishing stillness," which feel slightly elevated for the character's lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is largely clear and purposeful, with good rhythmic control. However, it suffers from a repetitive cadence and some conceptual redundancy (e.g., multiple iterations of "flourishing stillness"). These artifacts, while not fatal, create a slight drag on momentum and prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cosmic janitor and spiritual curiosity feels fresh and specific. The core concept is integrated organically, though the execution relies on a familiar contemplative trope. The risk-taking is moderate, resulting in a strong but not groundbreaking piece.</comment>
