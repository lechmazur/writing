<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amira's trauma and motivation are clear and embodied, particularly in the opening scene. Her shift to determined hunter is credible, though the transition lacks a deeply contradictory internal struggle. Dr. Patel is functional but serves primarily as a plot device, lacking distinct interiority or a status dynamic that pressures Amira's choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal lens holds, with the drone strike motivating the search for answers. Closure is a decisive change—Amira's newfound purpose—with a felt cost from her trauma. However, the convenient discovery of the Floating Observatory flyer and the under-explained application of perturbation theory introduce minor causality breaks that prevent a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, from the "scent of smoke and blood" to the observatory's "gentle hum." The geode crystal functions effectively as a micro-setting, constraining choices and charging the final image. The floating observatory is well-integrated, though its specific mechanics are lightly sketched.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (processing trauma/uncovering truth) is clear and escalates under the causal lens through data analysis. Amira's agency drives the hunt, and the cost of her loss is felt. The revelation that potential is a catalyst, however, is delivered via summary rather than a dramatized, causal turn, slightly softening the escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of trauma and potential emerge organically from the narrative. The geode crystal is a strong, recurring image that accrues meaning. Some thematic phrasing, like "unfiltered awakening," leans toward explicit statement rather than pure subtext, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable and effectively filters the world through Amira's trauma. The prose has a consistent, reflective texture. Minor repetition of phrases like "intangibly tangible" creates a slight rhythmic loop, and Dr. Patel's dialogue is functional but lacks distinct idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong sensory detail. The phrase "intangibly tangible" is repeated, creating a minor synonym loop. A few clunky phrases ("an intangibly tangible essence") slightly disrupt the rhythm, but these artifacts do not materially harm closure or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The core concept of a drone strike survivor using a mysterious crystal and perturbation theory to hunt for answers is a fresh, specific synthesis. The geode crystal is a particularly original and indispensable element. The concept is fully committed to, though the scientific method's integration feels slightly convenient.</comment>
