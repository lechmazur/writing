<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ava's motivation is clear and rooted in her profession and dual allegiance, compelling higher-stakes choices. Her orderly intuitive nature is shown through her methodical graffiti campaign, though the trait could be more embodied under pressure. The final stance of determined resistance is earned, with a visible cost in the risk she undertakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A causal lens holds: Ava's actions (because of gentrification) therefore lead to organized resistance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the community stands united on the brink of action; the cost of potential loss is felt. The structure is a clean, single-POV mosaic of the campaign's progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The raft city is vividly rendered with sensory detail that supports the carnival atmosphere and stakes. The foundation stone chip evolves from a message component to a potent symbol of resistance, actively charging the final image and constraining the narrative's meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving the city's essence) is signaled early and escalates through Ava's agency. Her graffiti campaign is a meaningful tightening that progressively narrows options for the community, moving from covert messages to a direct, united front, with the cost of discovery legible throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between community and privatization, resisting moralizing. The final image of the "perpetual carnival" as a "beacon of hope" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of what is worth preserving, reweighting the opening description.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filtered through Ava's professional, intuitive lens. The prose has a distinct, slightly elevated texture that suits the thematic weight, though occasional phrases like "hopeful desperation" verge on thematic statement. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful, advancing the narrative with good momentum. Minor artifacts include a tendency toward abstract thematic language (e.g., "essence," "spirit") and some repetitive sentence structures in descriptive passages, though clarity is never harmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The combination of a culture shock absorber in a floating carnival city resisting gentrification through graffiti is a fresh, specific synthesis. The core concept feels organic and inevitable, with the chosen elements heightening the stakes and coherence of the narrative without gimmickry.</comment>
