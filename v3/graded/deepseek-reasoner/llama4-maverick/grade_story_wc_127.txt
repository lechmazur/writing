<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Character's interiority is concrete and emotionally detached, but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Professional competence is clear, but emotional flatness limits peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds with atmospheric pressure building toward Charged Poise closure. Cost is felt in the dealer's departure and grotto's whisper, though tightening is subtle rather than dramatic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Amber grotto actively constrains focus and charges the final image through luminescent stones that dim and flicker. Sensory details are purposefully selective and woven through action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of artificial vs. genuine emotion emerges organically through the petal motif and dealer's craft. Final image of grotto holding memory offers resonant, non-moralizing closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature favoring sensory and professional lexicon. Voice remains consistent under pressure, though some phrases verge on decorative abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise of emotion-dealing is fresh, executed with specific detail. Synthesis of craft and empathy feels organic, though the concept of artificial emotions isn't radically transformed.</comment>
