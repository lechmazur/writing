<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a professional trait ("conspiracy debunker") that intensifies under pressure. However, interiority relies on summary ("Aria felt a sense of wonder and awe") rather than contradictory, embodied emotion in the peak beat. The final stance (Charged Poise) is earned by prior causality but lacks a visible, specific cost tied to her character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly; the investigation proceeds via because/therefore linkages (finding paper, reassembling letters, going to location). Closure is a valid Charged Poise, landing on the page with conceptual cost ("poised on the threshold of a new reality"). Minor deduction for the vague "liquidation" backstory which remains an unclear anchor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is a vivid, pressure-filled environment that constrains choice ("dust storms howled and buffeted her") and charges the final image ("sickly yellow glow," "pulsating glow"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV's urgent, investigative priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (uncover truth) and escalate through Aria's active choices (following the trail, reassembling letters, proceeding to the heart). A single meaningful tightening occurs as the letters reveal the liquidation's true nature, narrowing her options and raising the cost. The final charge into the storm shows earned agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. comfortable lies) emerges organically from the narrative and is resolved through the final, resonant image of the stillpoint—a non-literal answer that reweights the premise. However, the theme is occasionally stated directly ("excavate the truth from comfortable lies"), slightly reducing its subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptive, analytical texture. However, some sentences are purely functional and lack a strong rhythmic signature ("Aria set off towards the location, her heart pounding with excitement"). No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive, with good information density. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences ("Aria's curiosity was piqued, and she became more determined than ever to find the diamond" – a slight paraphrase loop). Figurative language is consistent and does not muddy clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a conspiracy debunker in a radioactive wasteland hunting a metaphysical artifact feels fresh and specific. The core concept (stillpoint) is integrated into the plot mechanics, not just theme. It avoids being derivative, though the "cursed object" trope is familiar.</comment>
