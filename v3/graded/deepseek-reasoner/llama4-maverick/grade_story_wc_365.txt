<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in professional curiosity and a deeper quest for truth. Interiority is concrete ("fingers twitched with the urge to chart") and emotions are embodied. However, the final revelation lacks a specific, dramatized cost; the change is summarized rather than shown through a difficult micro-choice, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through sensory and conceptual density. Closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing, reweighting her understanding of the multiverse. The cost, while implied, is not sharply legible in a single on-page image. The initial doorway activation via the shard feels slightly convenient, a minor causality slip.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through the POV's professional lens ("complex topography of the spaceport's neglect"). The setting successfully charges the final image upon her return. However, the spaceport itself does not actively constrain her choices during the journey, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through increasing density of worlds and patterns, reweighting the dominant stake of discovery. The protagonist's agency is maintained through her active seeking. The cost of this revelation is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page, limiting the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the journey and the final reconfiguration of understanding. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the quest for truth. It avoids moralizing, though the final realization could be more deeply anchored in a specific, concrete image to achieve greater potency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filtered through the map maker's perceptual signature. The prose has a distinct, textured rhythm. Some sentences verge on summary ("she moved through a succession of worlds") rather than sustained immersion, but the voice remains coherent and compelling throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong rhythmic control. Minor instances of scaffold phrasing appear ("her senses reeling," used twice), creating slight repetition. The figurative language is mostly effective, though a few phrases ("kaleidoscope of images") edge toward the generic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The core concept of a sensory cartographer navigating the multiverse is a fresh, specific synthesis. The execution feels organic and committed to its premise. The green glass shard as a talisman is a particularly ingenious and irreplaceable element that avoids cliché.</comment>
