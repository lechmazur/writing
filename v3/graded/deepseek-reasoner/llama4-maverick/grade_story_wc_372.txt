<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies, driving her choices. Interiority is specific, though some emotions ("thrill of excitement") could be more embodied. The final realization feels earned by her meticulous work, with cost in the race against time.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern recognition through sampling frequencies deepens stakes. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara realizes the vows are a living entity, with cost in the weight of preservation. Orientation is clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and atmospheric, with sensory detail purposefully woven. The library and lantern slide charge the final image, but the environment does not actively constrain choices, capping the score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: preserving meaning from oblivion. Escalation is driven by Elara's agency in sampling frequencies, leading to a pattern discovery that deepens knowledge. Cost is felt in the temporal pressure and the weight of her role as guardian.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interaction of character, object, and setting. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about the past shaping the present, reweighting the archive's significance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyrical, precise perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and patterned elision (e.g., "quartz hush") is taught and pays off at closure. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally strong with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting in some figurative clusters (e.g., "whispers of a forgotten lullaby") slightly dulls momentum but does not harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The combination of a frozen library, magic lantern slide, and luminous vows feels fresh and organic. The core premise offers a non-obvious angle on preservation and memory, executed with specificity and emotional truth.</comment>
