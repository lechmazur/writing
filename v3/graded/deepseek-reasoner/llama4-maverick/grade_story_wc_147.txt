<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling higher-stakes choices. Her internal conflict and embodied emotion are concrete, particularly the "melancholy and longing" felt at closure. However, the final renunciation is slightly diminished by a reliance on summary ("she knew that she would never forget") rather than a fully dramatized micro-choice with visible cost in the moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with pressure escalating through sensory density and cadence shifts. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with a felt cost of "melancholy and longing" legible on the page. The lens holds, though the final beat's summary phrasing slightly softens the cost's impact, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful, filtered through Kael's perception. The "crumbling stone," "salt and decay," and "great crystal orifice" are not just descriptive but actively pressure her choices and charge the final image of "unsettling stillness." The temple itself functions as a crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive intensification of sensory and emotional density, reweighting the dominant stake of preservation. The cost of "lonesome splendor" and "melancholy" is legible. Agency is clear, though the final harnessing is slightly swift, relying on "frenzied intensity" rather than a more granular tactical choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between preservation and loss, avoiding direct statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "bittersweet reminder" of the perfume vial. The integration is nearly flawless, with the core concept and specific particulars seamlessly supporting the thematic weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates effectively with emotional intensity. The perceptual signature is strong. A minor deduction for occasional summary phrasing in peak beats (e.g., "she knew that she would never forget") which slightly flattens the voice's immediacy at the crucial closure moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally concise and vivid with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on "gathered hush" and "lonesome splendor," which feel slightly repetitive and thematic-echo-like. The closure beat is clear, but the phrasing could be more embodied to avoid summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The combination of an underwater temple, a memory-touching perfume, and a solitary mission feels fresh and specific. The core premise is transformed through grounded, sensory detail and a consistent tone of melancholy wonder. It avoids cliché, though the concept of preserving fading memories is a familiar one, executed here with high skill.</comment>
