<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kaito's interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in his interaction with the compass and the lace-making. His emotional progression from sorrow to peace is realistic and earned through the ritual. However, a minor reliance on told emotion ("feeling a sense of peace") slightly abstracts the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Earned Stasis, a resonant reconfiguration where Kaito's renunciation (releasing the compass) forecloses his path of sorrow with a visible cost—the lingering "cerulean regret." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through sensory and emotional density. A minor deduction for the compass's late first appearance (~40% mark) slightly weakens its causal setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The islet setting is vividly rendered through selective, purposeful sensory detail ("scent of wet earth," "gentle waves") that reflects Kaito's POV. Crucially, the environment and the key object (compass) directly constrain his choice to sit and weave the lace, charging the final image of its release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift—the act of weaving the lace—which reweights the dominant stake of regret and forces a tangible choice. The cost is legible in the "cerulean regret" that remains, a price paid for closure. Agency is clear in Kaito's decision to enact his grandmother's method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the ritual, with the lace's "deep blue hue" serving as a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of unspoken apologies. The integration is subtle, avoiding moralizing, and the final image reweights prior sorrow with a sense of earned peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice distinct, with a slow, deliberate rhythm that mirrors Kaito's character. The prose possesses a strong perceptual signature, filtering the world through his calm, sorrowful lens. A minor instance of repetitive sentence stems ("Kaito felt...") slightly dulls immediacy at one point.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally elegant and purposeful, with high information density. However, a template cadence emerges in a cluster of sentences starting with "He" or "Kaito" in the middle third, and the phrase "rhythmically placid" is repeated, creating a minor text artifact that slightly disrupts momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bonsai tutor, a ghost ship's compass, and a lace-weaving ritual is fresh and organic, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The specific, grounded choices in character and method elevate a familiar theme of regret into a singular, memorable perspective. The risk-taking in the quiet, ritualistic plot heightens stakes.</comment>
