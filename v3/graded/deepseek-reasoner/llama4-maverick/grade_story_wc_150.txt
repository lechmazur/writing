<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent desire for connection, compelling her higher-stakes choices. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, though it could show more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final sense of belonging is earned, but the emotional progression is somewhat tidy, lacking the irrational self-deception that would heighten realism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands with a felt cost, crystallizing Maya's renewed faith and connection. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through the density of discoveries. A minor deduction for a slight loss of causal urgency in the middle beats, though the final image is potent and reconfigures meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is masterfully integrated, functioning as a crucible that pressures choices and charges the final image. The catacomb orchard and the sundial base are not just described but are active participants in the narrative, constraining Maya's actions and shaping her discoveries. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through her POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under the Accumulative lens, with each discovery deepening the stakes and her commitment. The cost of her labor and the weight of responsibility are legible, though the external pressure could be more viscerally felt to heighten the tension further. The final reconfiguration of her faith is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of excavation and reconnection, resisting direct statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of heritage and faith. Subtext operates effectively in the handling of artifacts and the sundial, though the theme of "interrupted journeys" is slightly more stated than fully integrated into the on-page action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a consistent, meditative texture appropriate to the character's introspection. The perceptual signature is clear, though the voice could possess a more distinct idiom to further separate it from a generic literary third-person. There is no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is well-controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with good rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a tendency towards slightly abstract summary in places (e.g., "purposeful wandering," "cautious enchantment") and a few repetitive stems that slightly dull momentum. The closure image, however, remains clear and potent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The combination of an archaeological dig and a spiritual quest feels organic and fresh. The specific setting of a catacomb orchard is a strong, memorable inflection. The execution is confident, though the concept hews closely to a known archetype (the seeker rediscovering roots), preventing a higher score for groundbreaking originality.</comment>
