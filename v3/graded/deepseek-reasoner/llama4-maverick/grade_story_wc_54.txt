<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a "functionally creative" trait. Her embodied emotions ("fingers itched," "stoic wonder") and micro-choices under pressure (envisioning pipe rerouting) reveal character. However, her competence is slightly overbalanced, lacking a genuine struggle or a costly mistake that compounds before resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inferred Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the terminal is reconfigured with new meaning and hope. The cost is legible in the final image: the terminal's rebirth required her effort and focus, foreclosing other paths. Linkage is pattern-based (maze, sextant, equations) rather than causal, which fits the lens. The ending lands with clear cost and reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Maya's professional perspective ("ancient pipes, their rusting valves and gauges"). The setting supplies resources but does not consistently pressure choices or constrain tactics; the maze is more thematic than a physical obstacle. The terminal is a evocative postcard that enriches atmosphere but lacks the necessary pressure on choices to score higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase and cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake (hope). Pressure coheres as Maya's vision intensifies. However, the escalation is largely internal and declarative ("she realized," "she began to envision"); the stakes lack a visceral, on-page test that would force a more difficult trade-off or demonstrate a clearer cost to her pursuit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges beautifully from events and images—abandonment, hope, rebirth—without direct statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting the maze and the sextant as symbols of possibility. The epiphany is earned through her specific struggle and tactile work, avoiding sentimentality or moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and effectively filtered through Maya's engineer mindset. The prose has a distinct, controlled texture. A minor register drift occurs in peak beats with slightly elevated diction ("ethereal light," "monument to the power of hope") that feels a step removed from her established voice, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in a run of sentences starting with "Maya" or "The" and a paraphrase loop near the end ("a sense of wonder, a sense of awe"). These do not obscure closure but slightly dull the final image's impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The combination of a civil engineer in a spaceport solving a symbolic maze with a sextant is a fresh, specific synthesis. The concept feels organic to character and conflict. While the execution is strong, the premise doesn't feel fully transformative of its components or carry a significant bold risk that would push it into the highest band.</comment>
