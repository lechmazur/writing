<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character is consistent and her motivation is clear, though more told than dramatized. The final sense of purpose is earned through her actions, but interiority lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, keeping it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a felt cost of transience. The orientation is clear, and the pattern of building and leaving signals provides a coherent through-line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful, fully immersing the reader. The grotto functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image, though it does not actively constrain a choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and the accumulative pressure builds to a meaningful cadence shift. However, escalation is more observational than driven by active, difficult choices, limiting the visceral feel of the cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges coherently from concrete particulars and the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer. A slight tendency toward explicit thematic statement ("a testament to the transience of life") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture. The prose effectively modulates with emotional intensity, and the patterned elision (e.g., the interrupted cadence motif) is taught and pays off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and rhythmic but risks overwriting in places (e.g., "atmosphere of blushing stillness"). A few synonym loops ("fragile, ephemeral, and beautiful") and a register drift slightly dull momentum, though clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination of an esoteric realist in a mystical natural setting feels fresh. The core concept is executed with specificity, though the premise itself is not radically transformative of its genre conventions.</comment>
