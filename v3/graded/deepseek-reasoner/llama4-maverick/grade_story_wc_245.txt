<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mapmaker's core motivation (navigating emotional depths) is clear and consistently drives the journey. The unique traits (blindness, skin absorption) are integrated into action and perception, though the emotional depth feels slightly summarized at the climax rather than fully embodied in a micro-choice under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the stillpoint with a clear, felt cost of self-understanding. The trail of musical notes provides a coherent pattern that escalates through sensory density, culminating in a decisive convergence of energy and insight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is a vivid, active participant that pressures the journey through its sonic and sensory properties. Key elements (compass ring, tattoos) constrain and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and filtered through the mapmaker's unique perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (emotional navigation) are signaled early and escalate through the intensifying melody and sensory convergence. Protagonist agency is demonstrated in the active pursuit and interpretation of clues. A single meaningful tightening occurs as the notes grow louder and the ring glows, foreclosing other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (inner navigation and harmony) emerges organically from the journey and the mapmaker's unique traits. The final image at the stillpoint offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of self-understanding without moralizing. Subtext operates through the forest's whispers and the shifting tattoos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by the mapmaker's blindness and sensory absorption. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the rising tension. Some minor register drift occurs in peak beats ("quiet blaze" appears twice, slightly elevated).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and highly sensory, with strong rhythmic control. However, slight overwriting and repetitive phrasing ("quiet blaze" x2, "symphony of sounds") create minor density issues in high-pressure beats. The closure image remains clear and impactful despite this.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a blind mapmaker in an ultrasonic forest is highly original and feels inevitable. The core concept (stillpoint) and unique traits (skin absorption) are transformed through specific, grounded choices that are indispensable to the narrative logic and emotional arc.</comment>
