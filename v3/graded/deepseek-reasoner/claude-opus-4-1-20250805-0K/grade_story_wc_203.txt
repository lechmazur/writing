<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marcus's characterization is deeply integrated with his ghost-seeing ability, rooted in past trauma. His "skillfully observant" trait drives concrete actions like dust pattern analysis. The final choice to gather evidence feels earned by his established motivation and grandmother's legacy. Embodied emotion avoids diagnostic labeling, particularly in the ghost's flickering transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly: Marcus's investigation progresses through because/therefore linkages. Closure is a decisive change (gathering evidence) with clear cost (ghosts fading). Orientation is immediate with concrete sensory details. The mainspring barrel's warmth provides a perfect causal payoff that reconfigures the story's meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices throughout - the dust patterns direct investigation, the ceiling tiles hide evidence. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("dust motes spiral through the last shaft of evening light"). The abandoned circus office functions as both atmosphere and crucible, with spatial choreography that tracks cleanly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through Marcus's discoveries, each narrowing options toward the climax. The dust analysis beat represents a meaningful tightening that forces the ceiling investigation. Cost is legible when ghosts fade after evidence is found. Agency remains with Marcus throughout, with no coincidental resolutions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the "cracks in the façade" concept, integrated into plot and character. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about fixing broken systems. Subtext operates powerfully in the ghost's counting ritual and the mainspring barrel's significance. Avoids moralizing while delivering profound emotional impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with professional specificity ("analyzing dust accumulation patterns"). POV remains strictly bound to Marcus's knowledge. Figurative language is voice-motivated and consistent ("cables singing," "dying wasp trapped in glass"). Syntax varies effectively between observational and emotional beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional line-level craft with high information density and rhythmic control. Metaphors are consistent and purposeful. No scaffolding or repetitive phrasing. The final paragraph demonstrates masterful cadence control with "every broken thing could still be fixed" serving as both thematic summation and character resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ghost story and systemic corruption themes. The elevator technician/ghost-seer premise feels fresh and inevitable. Risk-taking with accumulative design pays off in powerful closure. Specific details (horologist's mainspring barrel, dust analysis) create irreplaceable specificity.</comment>
