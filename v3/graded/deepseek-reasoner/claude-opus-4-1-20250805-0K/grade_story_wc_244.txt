<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sadie's characterization is precise and layered, with her "desperately jocular" edge and professional ghost persona creating immediate contradiction. Her micro-choice to drop the mask and reveal her true motive ("The cure for loneliness isn't company... It's purpose") is earned by the prior causality of her backstory. Marcus's transformation from lonely to catalyzed is legible and motivated, his flaw driving the central transaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds tightly; the meeting is a direct result of Sadie's rumor chain. Closure is a decisive change for Marcus, catalyzed into the "economy of human need," with cost felt in his solitary stance on the platform. The final image of the station "waiting for the next transaction" reconfigures the space's purpose, charging the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The ivy-choked station is no mere backdrop; it functions as a "green cathedral" that constrains the meeting to this isolated, liminal space and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV (e.g., Sadie smelling the "metallic otherness" of the moon rock). The setting's history of connection subtly mirrors the story's thematic core.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the start: a transaction of rare objects. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency as Sadie reveals the true, more complex stakes of curing loneliness through purpose. The cost is Marcus's relinquishment of a cherished heirloom for an uncertain future, a trade-off that narrows his options and reweights the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity vs. charity emerges organically from the transaction and Sadie's explanation, resisting moralizing. The final image of the station offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of human connection. The concept of "polite anarchy" is fully integrated into the story's logic and outcome without being stated until the final, earned line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with Sadie's voice sharp and particular ("professional ghost," "grin sharp enough to cut glass"). Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries significant subtext in the negotiation. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture that modulates with the emotional weight of the revelation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. One minor register drift occurs in the final line ("Polite anarchy... The only government worth having") which leans slightly toward declarative theme statement, though it is earned by the preceding action. This is a hairline slip that does not touch closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a high-concept disaster relief operative, a moon rock MacGuffin, and a theme of transactional human connection is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is executed with full commitment to its implications, transforming potential tropes into a singular and memorable narrative stance. Risk-taking heightens coherence.</comment>
