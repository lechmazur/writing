<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marina's characterization is concrete and deeply motivated; her fifteen-year journey from treasure hunter to "salvage artist of impossible things" provides a credible foundation for her final choice. Her micro-choices, like pressing the globe to her chest and transcribing the formula, reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final renunciation of a simple life for a greater purpose is earned by prior causality, though the cost of this endurance is felt more conceptually than viscerally on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through layered revelations that culminate in a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands with cost: Marina's understanding of her purpose is decisively altered, foreclosing her old life. The final image of her "carrying borrowed starlight" reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost, and the persistent constraint of the ghosts' need shapes her tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is a masterclass in micro-setting, intensely atmospheric and purpose-driven. It actively constrains choice and charges the final image, serving as the literal and figurative window between worlds. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Marina's professional POV, with the candlelight and ice walls becoming active participants in the revelation. The setting's evolution from a place of communion to a mapped constellation is causally integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive intensification: the shift from retrieving a single artifact to the revelation of twelve more globes. This meaningful cadence shift reweights the dominant stake of salvaging truth, fundamentally altering Marina's options and purpose. The cost is legible in her acceptance of a lifelong, global mission, though the immediate physical or emotional price of this choice is slightly oblique.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central image of "windows where others saw walls," exploring the salvaging of purity from wreckage. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "borrowed starlight," reweighting prior material without moralizing. The complexity of communicating through dreams and enduring loss is embraced without false equivalence or tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Marina's specific perceptual signature as a diver and listener. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with emotional intensity, particularly in phrases like "windows of connection" and "borrowed starlight." The single line of ghost dialogue is tonally consistent and serves a clear plot purpose, though its wind-through-ice-caves simile slightly risks ornamentation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences consistently advance multiple layers of story, character, and atmosphere without scaffold or loops. Figurative language, such as "candles reflected off the glacier ceiling, creating constellations," is purposeful and coherent, teaching a pattern that pays off at closure. No artifacts obscure cause/effect or dull the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck-diving, ghost communication, and dream analysis feels fresh, inevitable, and wholly integrated. The core concept of "windows of connection" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic, avoiding genre clichés. The story commits fully to its premise, and the final reconfiguration carries authentic risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
