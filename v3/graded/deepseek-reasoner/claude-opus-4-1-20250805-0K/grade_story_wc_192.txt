<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Keeper's characterization is precise and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure (handling the encroaching shadow) revealing her hierarchy of values. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality, though the backstory block slightly exceeds the 20% allowance, causing a minor deduction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of the keeper readying for the next shadow reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is clear by line 4.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary is not merely descriptive but actively constrains and enables the keeper's choices, charging the final image. The charcoal pillars and starlight are tactile, purpose-driven details filtered through a specific POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the shadow's encroachment, a coherent pressure that forces the keeper's stance crystallization and teaching method. The cost of her necessary endings is legible on the page, though the escalation is more intensification than a traditional turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of necessary emptiness emerges organically from concrete action and image (e.g., "breathing requires emptiness first"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the concept of thresholds and bridges.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure are exceptional. The voice is consistent, purposefully compressed, and the patterned elision (e.g., "loaded emptiness") is taught and paid off at closure without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion with zero loops or scaffold. Minor register drift in "surgical precision" is a hairline slip, but figurative language is coherent and supports pressure without muddling closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of healing and severance feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative, lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, committing fully to its singular artistic stance.</comment>
