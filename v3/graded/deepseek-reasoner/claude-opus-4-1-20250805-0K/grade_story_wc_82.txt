<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mei's characterization is deeply embodied through craft-focused micro-choices and a credible emotional arc from raw grief to transformative acceptance. Her final realization feels earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the polished gems and reconfigured love. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on thematic statement in Master Shen's dialogue, though it remains character-appropriate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through layered imagery and emotional density rather than causal turns. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mei's understanding of love transforms, with cost legible in the final image of lanterns casting living shadows. The structure is taught early and pays off impeccably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, with the floating tea garden and glass basilica constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mei's professional lens. The environment actively shapes her tactics and the story's emotional logic, with the basilica looming as a constant spatial and emotional anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mei's agency under the accumulative lens, with a decisive intensification at the discovery of Lin's possible future. The dominant stake (transforming grief) tightens meaningfully, and cost is felt in the agonizing creation of each dream-gem. Pressure coheres until the final reconfiguration of love's form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars—lanterns, gems, cranes—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to grief through the image of light guiding others. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like polishing and folding, and the emotional aftereffect is earned through specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Mei's craft. Diction remains within her lexicon, and rhythmic control supports emotional pressure. Minor deduction for occasional ornate phrasing that slightly disrupts voice consistency in high-pressure beats, but overall legibility and purpose are excellent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. However, minor figurative overloading occurs in phrases like "luminous torment" and "ascending descent," creating slight register drift in peak beats. No loops or scaffold issues, and closure clarity remains untouched.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief, craft, and light feels fresh and inevitable. Specificity in world-building (dream-gems, floating isles) avoids tropiness, and emotional truth grounds the fantastical elements. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
