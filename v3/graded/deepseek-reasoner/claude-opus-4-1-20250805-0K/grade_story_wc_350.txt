<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marta's characterization is deeply integrated with her role and actions; her empathetic decisiveness is demonstrated through her intuitive conducting of the elevators, and her micro-choice to attach the clock weight reveals her values. Interiority is concrete and embodied, particularly in lines like "her chest cavity vibrate." The final endurance—listening among her neighbors—is earned by her prior causality and struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in the transformation of isolation into community. The lens holds perfectly as density of sound and language builds to a cadence shift. Orientation is immediate and purposeful, with no causality breaks. The final image of the swinging weight charges the closure with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower and grain elevators are indispensable, constraining choice (the resonance chamber rig) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Marta's expertise (e.g., "frequencies only she seemed to hear"). Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting evolves causally with the symphony.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the Accumulative lens is driven by Marta's agency, with pressure building through the addition of elevator voices, narrowing options toward community action. The dominant stake (rehabilitation) is signaled early and deepens through acoustic bridges. Cost is legible in the on-page gathering and sharing among farmers, foreclosing isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—elevators as silos, languages as bridges—without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of harmony healing division. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., farmers remembering ancestral languages) and the final card's message feels earned, not stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Marta's expertise ("acoustic bridges"). Prose rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating with the choir's growth. Lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains within her plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propelled, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "their steel shells resonating with frequencies only she seemed to hear" establishes character, concept, and conflict). Rhythm varies naturally, and there are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. Read-aloud quality is high, with clarity maintained even in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise—grain elevators singing in response to linguistic frequencies—is brilliantly original and fully committed. Synthesis of elements (clock tower, librarian, languages) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyrical accumulation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept transforms familiar tropes through grounded, specific detail.</comment>
