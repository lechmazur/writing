<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's dual allegiance is a clear, consistent motivator that compels her high-stakes choice. Her internal conflict is dramatized through her handling of the stone chip, a concrete, character-particular anchor. The final choice to reorganize is a credible endurance/renunciation, though its motivation leans slightly more on summary than on-scene contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the community incorporates to preserve its culture, a decisive change with clear cost (the need to navigate with laws). The inferred Causal lens holds: the graffiti warning triggers her investigation and plan. A persistent constraint (the threat of privatization) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The raft city setting is a masterclass in micro-setting, vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the plot. It actively pressures choices and supplies key resources (the graffiti system, the lighthouse). The foundation stone chip, a recurring object, constrains Maya's choice and charges the final image when placed in the cornerstone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: the developers' arrival forces Maya's hand. The dominant stake (community survival) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. The cost is legible in the community's need to legally incorporate, fundamentally altering their ungovernable identity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (preservation through adaptation) emerges organically from the central conflict and is crystallized in the final image of the legally protected carnival. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of survival, reweighting prior material (the graffiti, the stone) without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, controlled texture with a strong perceptual signature ("black water like scattered prayers"). The voice modulates effectively with the emotional intensity of the crisis. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is high, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "hopeful desperation that infected them all"), but clarity is never harmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core premise—using cultural heritage as a legal shield against gentrification—is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The specific, grounded world of the raft city and its unique communication system (graffiti) transform a familiar conflict into a singular, memorable vision.</comment>
