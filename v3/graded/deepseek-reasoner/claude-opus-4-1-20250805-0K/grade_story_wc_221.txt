<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kira's motivation is deeply rooted in familial legacy and personal revelation, with embodied emotion ("feeling its warmth pulse") and a micro-choice to sketch a new constellation that earns her transformation from pariah to guide. Her internal conflict—seeing her "curse" as a compass—is dramatized in scene, not summarized. The final endurance as a fixed point carries cost on the page ("continued sketching") and is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds tightly: Kira's touch enables glimpses, which inform her sketching, which activates the compass to guide others. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as she becomes "home for others," with cost legible in her solitary, enduring role. Orientation is clear within 120 words (who, where, when), and the final image reconfigures isolation into purpose with undeniable pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The observation deck and compass rose are micro-settings that constrain and enable choice—the compass is handled, its heat felt, and it directly charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("crystalline walls reflecting nothing but the void"), filtered through Kira's navigator bias. The deck's spatial reality pressures her choice to remain and act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kira's agency under the causal lens: her decision to sketch the station as a constellation narrows options and enables the climax. The dominant stake (guiding lost souls) tightens through her irreversible act, with cost visible in her accepted isolation. No coincidence; resolution earned through character choice and tool use.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—true north as a fixed point is embodied in Kira's transformation, not stated. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of her becoming a lighthouse. Subtext operates in the reweighting of "blessed pariah" and "confusion into exploration," avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, precise perceptual signature ("temporally stretched like taffy"). Purposeful compression (e.g., "shutdown" backstory) is taught early and pays off. No head-hopping; diction remains within Kira's navigator lexicon, and syntax varies to match emotional intensity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density ("starlight remembered in gold, navigation encoded in beauty"). No loops or scaffolding; figurative language is consistent and clarity is maintained even in peak beats. Rhythm supports the story's contemplative yet urgent tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of time dilation, navigation, and familial legacy feels fresh and inevitable. The compass rose and sketching custom are transformed through specific, grounded choices that heighten stakes. Risk-taking in lyrical compression pays off without obscuring clarity, and the core premise commits fully to its implications.</comment>
