<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is exceptional, with clear motivation rooted in her expertise. Her final choice to transform the library rather than take from it is earned by prior causality and reveals a hierarchy of values. The cost is felt in the release of the seekers, demonstrating a credible endurance. Interiority is concrete and embodied, avoiding diagnostic language.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (the mountain's transformation) with clear cost (the released seekers). The drive lens is accumulative/textural, with pressure escalating through pattern breaks (the circular room) and a cadence shift (the negotiation). The lens holds, and the final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in specificity and function. The labyrinthine bookstore actively constrains choices (the circular room trap) and charges the final image (the amber-preserved seekers). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Mira's professional bias. The mountain itself is a character that shapes the entire narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the accumulative lens, from solving the circular room to the final negotiation. The dominant stake (access to wisdom) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. The cost is legible on the page in the frozen seekers and their subsequent release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of transforming preserved knowledge into living wisdom emerges organically from the core concept and Mira's final choice. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of seeds being planted. It avoids moralizing and embraces complexity, with the final reconfiguration charging all prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, scholarly voice that modulates under pressure. The prose has a distinct texture and rhythmic control. Purposeful elision (the exact password, the traveler's warnings) is taught early and pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deductions for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "unheard symphony") but it remains coherent and legible. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts that obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise is extraordinarily fresh and executed with full commitment. The synthesis of a sentient mountain bookstore, a library of unlearned lessons, and a botanical map feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, resulting in a singular artistic vision.</comment>
