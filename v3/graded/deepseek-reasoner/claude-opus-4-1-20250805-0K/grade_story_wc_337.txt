<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied through her "scarred fingers" and the "lucid unrest" of her craft. Her motivation is clear and intensifies, compelling her to higher-stakes choices as she unravels the net and communes with the dead. A minor deduction for a slight diagnostic tone in "moving through dream logic," but her final endurance is earned and her internal contradiction is shown, not summarized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural drive lens is taught early and held. Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the spirits settle, their gratitude felt "between heartbeats." The cost is legible in Mira's acceptance of her endless, weighty inheritance. The pattern of unknotting and stitching provides a coherent, escalating structure that deepens to a cadence shift at dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The Prism Sanctuary is indispensable, its crystal walls actively focusing starlight to complete the ritual. The tapestry needle and the net are not described but used, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the action, with the environment evolving from starlight to sunrise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a masterful density increase and cadence shift. The dominant stake (freeing the spirits) is signaled early and tightens through the accumulating mask fragments and the sanctuary's humming intensification. The cost is the tangible weight of the "interlaced hush" and Mira's resigned acceptance of her cyclical duty.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of mending and remembrance, resisting moralizing. The core concept of the "interlaced hush" is the thematic engine, explored through the weaving of silence and sound, death and life. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to heal the past.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply embedded in Mira's perception, with a distinct, lyrical texture. The voice is confident and consistent, modulating with the emotional intensity of the visions. Purposeful compression ("Hours dissolved into the work") and patterned diction serve the accumulative design and closure effect perfectly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("coiled like a sleeping serpent"), without muddle or artifact. The final paragraph is a masterclass in concision and resonant image-making.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a mask restorer, a haunted net, and a prism sanctuary is wholly original and feels inevitable. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in world logic and a non-obvious moral calculus of duty. The story commits fully to its singular vision without safety-hedging.</comment>
