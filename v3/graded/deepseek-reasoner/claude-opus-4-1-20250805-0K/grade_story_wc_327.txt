<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The storyteller's motivation is clear, rooted in a specific, high-stakes goal. Her actions are consistent and reveal character under pressure, particularly in her patient observation of the starlings and her final, physical translation work. A slight deduction for a lack of overt internal contradiction or a visible micro-choice that reveals a hierarchy of values; her competence is pronounced, though her final transformation carries a clear cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural drive lens is clearly established and held. Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the storyteller's physical transformation into the canyon itself reconfigures the premise of preservation from translation to integration. The cost is legible on the page in the image of her "veins finally cooled" and her body becoming a "tower of bone." The structure is masterful for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is not merely described but is the active crucible of the story. The bone towers and canyon are indispensable, constraining choice (the need to use them as instruments) and decisively charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the protagonist's goal-directed action, creating a deeply immersive and purposeful atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive cadence shift and pattern break: the realization of the diamond's flaw matching the starlings' formation. This reweights the dominant stake, narrowing her method and enabling the climax. The cost of her ultimate physical dissolution is the unmistakable price paid for this agency-driven success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of preserving loss through transformation emerges organically from the specific events and the stunning final image. It offers a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question, avoiding moralizing entirely. The transformation of the curse into a "translator of impossible things" provides profound thematic closure that reweights all prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, controlled, and perfectly matched to the Accumulative/Textural mode. The prose has a distinct texture and rhythmic control, with a perceptional signature that filters the world through the protagonist's unique, metallic senses. Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off brilliantly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and precise, with high information density and clear propulsion. There is a minor instance of potential register drift or dense figurative language in the phrase "consonants softening like worn stone," which, while beautiful, slightly abstracts a key piece of information. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story synthesizes its elements into a profoundly original and singular vision. The core concept of a language of texture and a tunnel of echoes is fresh and fully committed to, with every choice in character, object, and method feeling organic and inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking in the closure image pays off magnificently.</comment>
