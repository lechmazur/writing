<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's frugality and devotion are concrete, character-particular motives that intensify under pressure, compelling her high-stakes choice to activate the beacon. Her final smile shows earned wisdom through struggle, with visible cost in years of isolation. Embodied emotion ("trembling fingers") and micro-choices (aligning charts) reveal character under pressure without diagnostic speak. The renunciation of worldly wealth feels inevitable given prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: knowledge builds through patterned layers (blueprints, charts, tiles) until closure reweights meaning. Orientation is immediate ("abandoned palace's lower chambers"). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the awakened palace becomes a "meeting place between minds," with cost legible in Mara's frugal years purchasing this moment. The final image reconfigures the palace's purpose with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable: the palace's architectural encryption constrains Mara's choices and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("starlight filtered through calculated gaps," "phosphorescent minerals"). The magic square tile functions as micro-setting, evolving from mathematical curiosity to communicative key. Spatial choreography is coherent as Mara navigates the chamber and arranges charts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering communication method) escalates through accumulative density of clues until the tile's warmth signals turning point. Agency is clear: Mara's alignment of charts and spoken numbers drive the climax. Cost is legible in her years of devotion and the palace's resonant awakening. Pressure coheres under the textural lens without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme (devotion as bridge to cosmic understanding) emerges organically through concrete particulars: frugality, tile manipulation, and resonant harmony. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the image of "minds united by mathematical truth," reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in shifting cuneiform and hummed frequencies. Complexity embraces both empirical irony and spiritual fulfillment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct with a perceptive signature ("calculated gaps," "empirically ironic"). Diction remains within Mara's scholarly lexicon while achieving lyrical intensity ("dusky harmony"). Purposeful compression (backstory in paragraph 2) increases density without loss. No head-hopping; free indirect style cleanly renders her realization ("She understood now why...").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance multiple layers ("empirically ironic truth" carries thematic weight). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is pattern-taught ("communication through numerical patterns"). Minor deduction (-0.1) for "empirically ironic" repeating as label rather than fully dramatized, though it partially pays off.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of astronomy, cryptography, and ontological mystery feels inevitable in hindsight. The Babylonian setting is transformed through specific architectural encryption rather than exotic backdrop. Risk-taking in conceptual repricing (palace as beacon, not dwelling) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth anchors the cosmic scope.</comment>
