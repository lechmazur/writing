The final choice to seek the owner feels inevitable based on his established role as a preserver.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a decisive change (DC) achieved through a clear causal chain: finding the box leads to playing it, which compels the search for Elena, culminating in his new purpose. The drive lens is Causal, with strong because/therefore linkages. Cost is legible in the final image of his transformed solitude.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The feral loft, music box, and jars are not just descriptive but actively constrain and enable choices, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Marcus's professional priorities. The setting evolves from a forgotten space to a visited archive, mirroring his internal shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the Causal lens: his decision to find the owner tightens the stakes from personal preservation to intergenerational connection. The cost is the emotional risk and effort of his search, which pays off by fundamentally altering his role and purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars of captured sounds and the music box's journey, resisting moralizing.

<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance multiple elements of story and atmosphere simultaneously.
