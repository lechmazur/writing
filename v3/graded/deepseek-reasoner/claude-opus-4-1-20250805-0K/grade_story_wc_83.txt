<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amira's motivation is clear, rooted in specific trauma, and intensifies under pressure. Her "bleak exhilaration" and micro-choices (adjusting the scanner, pressing the geode) reveal a complex, driven character. Dr. Chen, however, functions more as a reactive secondary pressure source; his hesitation and subsequent help are credible but lack deep interior contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly: Amira's plan (because of her grief and knowledge) leads her to exploit the power outage (therefore) to access the scanner, which successfully proves her theory. Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the final image of Earth's scars hiding "pools of trapped potential" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost and hope. The cost is legible in the transmitted data and the security's arrival.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The floating observatory is vividly rendered ("suspended three kilometers above Earth's surface") and the geode is a potent micro-setting object, its crystalline interior "catching the observatory's sterile light." However, while the setting atmospherically supports the concept, it does not actively constrain a choice or decisively charge the final image; it is a stage rather than a crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens: the forty-minute time constraint tightens options, forcing Amira to act and recruit Chen. The dominant stake (proving the existence of severed futures) is meaningfully deepened by the discovery, and the cost is felt in the security's arrival and the irreversible transmission of data.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully from the integration of quantum theory and grief, resisting simple morals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the potential is to be returned, not harnessed, reweighting the premise from exploitation to restoration. The geode transforms from a relic of trauma to a vessel of hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, scientific, and grief-tinted voice. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though brief. The prose has a distinct texture, though the phrase "bleak exhilaration" slightly edges toward diagnostic label-speak. Elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally concise and vivid with strong rhythm and information density. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "intangibly tangible presence" is a near-contradictory metaphor that slightly muddles sense in a peak beat. Otherwise, sentence-level craft is strong and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of high-concept quantum physics with intimate personal trauma is highly original and feels organic, not checklist-driven. The premise is fully committed to and its implications are followed through to a bold, coherent, and satisfying conclusion that transforms a common trope (ghosts/aftermath) through a specific, grounded, and ingenious lens.</comment>
