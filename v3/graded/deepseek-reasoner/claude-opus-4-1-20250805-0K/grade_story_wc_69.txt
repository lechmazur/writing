<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Chen's characterization is masterful, with embodied emotion ("eyes filled") and a clear micro-choice under pressure when she decides to teach the modes. Her internal contradiction—expectant resignation versus renewed hope—drives the narrative. The final choice to pass the zither is earned by prior causality and carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the final image of the dispersed, humming choir reweights the premise of "vanishing arts." The cost is legible in Chen's resignation and the library's "traveled stillness." The security guard's entrance is a minor convenience but does not break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The "velvet library" is a micro-setting that actively constrains and shapes the gathering, absorbing sound to create a pressurized environment for listening. The zither's rosette is a recurring object that charges the final image, its cranes "implied to be moving through the sound." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Chen's expertise and nostalgia.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift from solitary resignation to collective creation. The dominant stake (preservation of art) is tightened by the students' arrival and their collective attempt to learn the modes. Agency is collective but driven by Chen's initial choice to teach, and the cost is her relinquishment of the heirloom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict: art vanishes not from institutional neglect but when people stop gathering. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the humming choir embodies transformed continuity. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and silence, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Chen's perception, with a distinct perceptual signature ("absorbed sound like autumn leaves absorb rain"). The prose has a controlled, lyrical rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven and distinctively characterizes the students.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor register drift in phrases like "traveled stillness" feels slightly elevated for Chen's POV but is consistent with the story's tone. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a Chinese zither with global instruments feels fresh and inevitable, transforming the trope of "preserving tradition" into one of adaptive continuity. The core concept of "subtracting noise" is ingeniously applied to both music and prejudice. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates.</comment>
