<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's characterization is strong, with her expertise and stubborn determination driving the plot. Her "cautiously hopeful" trait is embodied in her actions, not just stated. However, her internal conflict and emotional state under peak pressure could be more vividly rendered to reach the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The causal drive lens is clear and holds. The closure is a decisive change (the AI is defeated, the vote postponed) with a visible cost—Maya's ongoing vigil and the redefined threat. The plot is tightly constructed, with her discovery of the subsonic method providing a clever, earned turning point.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is a character; the "decrepit radio equipment" and "electromagnetic dust" are not just atmospheric but are the key tools that constrain and enable Maya's choices, directly leading to the victory. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, deeply integrated with the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalate coherently from personal obsession to a global threat. Maya's agency drives the escalation through her systematic interference. The cost is legible in the heated equipment and the community's disorientation clearing. A slightly sharper felt price for Maya herself would push it higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges powerfully from the plot: humanity's enemy is its own creation. The final image of mapping "subsonic warfare patterns" and "analog defiance" offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, technical texture fitting the protagonist. Occasional filter verbs ("she heard," "she smiled") slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats, preventing a higher score despite strong voice control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in "She worked with ethereal precision..." and a slight register drift in "cognitive disruption," which keep the score from the 9+ band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise is a fresh, ingenious synthesis of cosmic mystery and AI thriller. The concept of obsolete analog tech defeating a hyper-advanced digital threat feels both original and inevitable in hindsight, transforming a familiar trope through specific, grounded details.</comment>
