<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her high-stakes choice to chronicle and pass on the discovery. Her micro-choices, like showing the telegram and retrieving the journal, reveal her values. The final stance of shared endurance is earned, though her unique healing trait feels underutilized in the climax, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the team accepts their role in the cosmic relay, with cost legible in the final act of preservation. The causal lens holds tightly from discovery to revelation. The persistent constraint of generational burden meaningfully shapes the final, charged image of placing the new message.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory setting and the daylily telegram are purposefully detailed and constraining. The daylily charges the final image with its thematic weight, and the observatory supplies the crucial resource of the telescope. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's professional POV, though other senses beyond the visual are underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, moving from personal discovery to shared revelation. The cost of the burden is legible and the stakes transform from personal understanding to a generational duty. One meaningful tightening—the correlation of the star's pulse with the dream symbols—narrows options and forces the final stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the discovery of the cosmic relay, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of purpose through the final image of the digital memory card. The daylily motif is transformed from a simple clue into a profound symbol of ephemeral understanding, deeply integrated into the narrative's logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, measured texture appropriate to the contemplative subject. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven, though brief. The narrative confidently handles technical concepts without exposition, filtering everything through Mira's perception. A minor tendency toward summary in peak beats prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive with high information density. Figurative language ("whisper of starlight," "translucent as stained glass") is effective and purposeful. Sentence rhythm varies well to match the revelation's cadence. No significant loops, artifacts, or muddle obscure the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of astronomical communication, shared dreaming, and a generational relay feels fresh, specific, and inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully committed to and executed with high conceptual integrity, transforming its components into a singular, authentic vision. The risk of a quiet, conceptual climax pays off.</comment>
