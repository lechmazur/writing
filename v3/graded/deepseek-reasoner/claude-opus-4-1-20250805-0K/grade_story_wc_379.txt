<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marta's characterization is precise and embodied; her curator's instinct and quiet listening are consistent micro-choices that compel higher-stakes action. Her final realization about objects as doorways is earned by the locket's journey and her own patient agency. The only minor deduction is for a slight diagnostic feel in the final paragraph's insight, though it remains anchored in the concrete.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Elena's transformation and the courtyard's new identity as "home") landed with undeniable cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly: pressure builds through gathered neighbors and discovered letters, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights the stake. The locket's discovery initiates a because/therefore chain that narrows options toward a single, inevitable mission.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The courtyard functions as a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and supplies resources (neighbors, information). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Marta's professional gaze. The locket itself, a recurring object, constrains choice and decisively charges the final image when hung around Elena's neck.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: Marta's choice to say "Show me" transforms the stake from personal curiosity to communal action. The cost is legible in Elena's initial catatonia and the neighbors' collective effort, forcing a trade-off of time and energy that alters tactics and leads to the letters.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the locket's journey and the neighborhood's action, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: listening unlocks what seems sealed. The final image of the courtyard as "this home" reweights prior material without statement, achieving profound emotional honesty through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature shaped by Marta's curator mindset. Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries significant subtext, especially Jorge's "sandstorm calm" and Elena's whispered "My Sofia." Prose rhythm is controlled and varies effectively with emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language ("sandstorm calm") is precise and voice-motivated. There is no scaffold, loop, or register drift. The final paragraph's rhythm breathes with earned wisdom, perfectly supporting the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a thrift-store curator, a locked mailbox, and neighborhood storytelling feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and community. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry.</comment>
