<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Margot's motivation is clear and rooted in concrete interiority ("Three years of anger compressed into four syllables"). Her final choice is earned by the revelation, though Viktor's late arrival limits on-page relationship pressure. Embodied emotion is strong, but the second character's development is necessarily abbreviated at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds strongly with tight because/therefore linkages. Closure is a decisive change (forged agent) with clear on-page cost in her pocketing both pillboxes and the folder. Orientation is immediate, and the plot amnesia test is passed—the morphine tablet's meaning is paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral, not decorative. The mist and snow-codes actively constrain movement and reveal plot-critical information. Zephyr Bluff's environment charges the final image as the codes melt, completing their purpose. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate under the causal lens. The revelation about the mole and Margot's unique position constitutes a meaningful tightening that narrows her options to a single, high-cost choice. Protagonist agency drives the escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transformation from "burned to forged" emerges organically from the plot and the reweighting of the "unused courage" motif. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates effectively in the snow-code messages.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature ("swallowing sound and sight in its silver hush"). The prose's rhythmic control is evident, particularly in the closure. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven and carries significant subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Sentences advance multiple elements simultaneously (e.g., "The mist swirled between them like a curtain" sets tone and visual barrier). Read-aloud quality is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of the burned spy trope with the "unused courage" motif feels fresh and inevitable. The GRU snow-codes are a specific, grounded choice. The concept is well-executed, though the core premise itself is a recognizable genre archetype, limiting a higher score.</comment>
