<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and intensifies, her embodied emotion ("fingers trembled") and micro-choices under pressure are strong. The final renunciation is earned, though the epiphany's articulation edges toward diagnostic language in the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing with felt cost ("rough like bark, soft like moss"). Causality is slightly soft—the bridge's mechanics enabling the revelation are more asserted than demonstrated, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action and theme, with the environment itself functioning as the primary crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens. The cost of the fragment's disintegration and the reconfiguration of her understanding is legible and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of time's mutable texture emerges organically from concrete events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. The final paragraph avoids moralizing, instead landing on a powerful, earned image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a rich perceptual signature. The lyrical, compressed prose is perfectly suited to the Accumulative drive and concept, with no head-hopping or voice leakage. A masterclass in controlled elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical with superb rhythmic control. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("like sugar dissolving in tears," "like watercolor paintings"), though it remains coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of metaphysical concept, living architecture, and personal revelation is highly original and feels inevitable. The premise is fully committed to and executed with bold, specific choices that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
