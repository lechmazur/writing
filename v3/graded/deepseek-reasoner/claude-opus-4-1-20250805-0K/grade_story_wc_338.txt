<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's methodical curiosity is embodied through specific actions (synchronizing videos, UV light examination) and her emotional shift from guarded to generous is earned through tactile engagement with the map. Her professional expertise grounds her epiphany without diagnostic labeling, and her final choice to "reopen the chapel's purpose" stems directly from her accumulated understanding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot builds through layered discoveries (video comparison, UV mark, satellite imagery) that culminate in a resonant Conceptual Repricing of silence and empathy. The cost is legible in her final, vulnerable act of adding her oils to the map, foreclosing her old life of mere observation. The closure lands with undeniable conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault is a masterclass in micro-setting, actively constraining and enabling Elara's work while mirroring the theme of decay and revelation. Key objects—the torn map, the twin monitors, the UV light—are not described but used, each discovery charging the final image. The environment is a crucible, not a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</comment><comment>Stakes escalate through a series of deepening discoveries rather than causal turns, perfectly suiting the accumulative lens. Each revelation (gestures repeated, thumbprint coordinates, barren satellite image) narrows Elara's focus and raises the cost of her commitment. The final decision to drive to the moors is a direct, agentive response to this accumulated pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of wordless communication emerges organically from the specific particulars: torn maps, silent videos, oil secretions, and repeated gestures. The final paragraphs offer a profound, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing, reconfiguring the meaning of "whispered" and "chapel" through the powerful image of accumulated human presence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The POV is consistently anchored in Elara's perceptive, analytical consciousness. The prose possesses a distinct, rhythmic texture that mirrors her methodical mind ("methodically curious nature demanding precision"). Diction remains within her plausible lexicon, and the voice modulates beautifully under the pressure of her discovery into something more generous and open.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences like "protection without isolation, revelation without exposure" demonstrate masterful concision and thematic resonance. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; every image advances character and atmosphere. A single minor deduction for a slightly telling phrase in the climax ("she understood now").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography, silent ritual, and digital restoration feels wholly original and inevitable. The core concept of a "whispered chapel" is transformed from a literal place into a profound metaphor for empathetic connection, achieved through breathtakingly specific and grounded choices. The story commits fully to its unique premise without a hint of derivative execution.</comment>
