<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira’s characterization is exceptional, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. Her pacifism is not a label but a practiced, tactile philosophy. Her father’s shift from hunter to planter is earned through on-page causality and visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hybrid drive lens (Causal/Accumulative) holds strong. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the father sheathes his weapon and plants seeds, reconfiguring their relationship with felt cost. The tower's fall provides coherent situational pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert rose farm are not just backdrop; they actively constrain and enable choices, charging the final image. Sensory details are filtered through Mira's professional perception, with the sandbag scrap evolving from ballast to seed pouch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the father's early return and completed contract, forcing a stance crystallization. The dominant stake (weaving continuity through chaos) tightens meaningfully as he chooses to participate in her pacifist work, with visible cost in his deliberate movements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between destruction and cultivation. The final image of planting seeds together offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of persistence, reweighting prior violence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice that modulates under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but potent, carrying significant subtext in the father's terse announcement and Mira's corrective explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor repetition of "quiet" in adjacent paragraphs is a hairline slip, but it does not obscure closure clarity or cause momentum drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of bounty hunting and pacifist horticulture is fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "engraved quiet" transforms a familiar trope through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
