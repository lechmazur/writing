<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marina's characterization is exceptional, with her strength fluctuation, embodied struggle with the censer foot, and the micro-choice to admit she walked the path herself revealing a hierarchy of values. Her final stance crystallization as a shepherd is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held, building pressure through midnight calls and physical strain toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure lands with undeniable cost in her raw certainty and the warm bronze foot holding her in place, reconfiguring her duty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The starlit signal station and patina bronze censer foot are not just described but actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Marina's urgency and professional priorities, with the object's warmth becoming a tactile anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with each call raising the emotional stakes until her brother's arrival forces a costly, tactical choice. The dominant stake of guiding the lost tightens meaningfully, and the cost of her endurance is legible in her trembling and stiff fingers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment>The theme of duty versus longing emerges organically from concrete particulars—the censer foot, the calls, the poisoned geography. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of her building bridges from words, reweighting the premise of migration without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature shaped by loss and professional focus. Purposeful compression in the calls works effectively. POV is stable and deeply internal, with syntax and rhythm reflecting Marina's degraded strength and resolve under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language ("patchwork navigator," "geography of loss") is pattern-taught and pays off. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; clarity is maintained even in peak emotional beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-apocalyptic reverse migration with a navigator using words instead of technology is a fresh, non-obvious angle. The concept is fully committed to and followed through with specific, grounded choices in character and world logic, creating a singular artistic stance.</comment>
