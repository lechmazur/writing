<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Amara's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, compelling her to engage with Marcus and the lagoon. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, though her emotional embodiment in the peak beat ("searing weight") leans slightly toward summary. The final endurance is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Amara's understanding reconfigures the meaning of the struggle. The retrocognitive trap is the inciting incident and the pattern-making on the shore is the decisive action, both landing with cost. Orientation is clear by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and the zeppelin are not just described but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through Amara's professional and personal priorities. The lagoon's re-emergence and the zeppelin's reflection create a powerful, purposeful atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift—the physical descent to the shore and the synchronized arrangement of debris. This act deepens Amara's knowledge and narrows her options, forcing a stance crystallization. The cost is legible in the "searing weight" of the revealed truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of truth and tension emerges organically from the events and the final image, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The complexity of love and betrayal within the movement is embraced without false equivalence or moralizing. The final paragraph reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and effective, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The prose's slightly elevated, lyrical register is voice-motivated and consistent with the character's role as an archivist. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven and carries significant subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor instance of potential register drift exists in "searing reverie," which feels slightly summary-like for a peak beat, preventing a higher score. Otherwise, the language is precise, vivid, and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a retrocognitive civil-rights mystery with a floating archive is a fresh, non-obvious angle. The core concept is fully committed to and its implications are followed through with integrity. The specific lived detail of the lagoon and the diary transforms familiar tropes into a singular vision.</comment>
