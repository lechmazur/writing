<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thorne and Amara exhibit clear, consistent motives rooted in witnessed injustice. Their micro-choices under pressure (aligning the quill, orchestrating the blackout) reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority is concrete and embodied, though Amara's stern face "softened by understanding" edges toward a minor tell.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant Charged Poise, crystallizing the quiet certainty of the coming revolution. The cost is legible in the separation "without farewell" and the risk they carry. The sundial's coded mechanics are taught early and pay off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. The quill holder, sundial, and darkness are tactile tools of the plot. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Thorne's professional vigilance. The fort itself is a character pressuring the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure escalates coherently under the Accumulative lens through the density of the conspiratorial act. The dominant stake (sparking revolution) is signaled early and deepens with the Captain's arrival, narrowing their options. The cost of their complicity is felt in their silent separation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central concept of "death by a thousand paper cuts." The final image of tending a "quiet fire" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to overthrow an empire, reweighting the prior symbolism without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature attuned to observation and secrecy. The prose rhythm is controlled, modulating with the tension of the covert operation. The single line of dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information economy. Figurative language ("like light through prisms," "pulse through the fort's veins") is purposeful and coherent. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. Zero artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a silent, bureaucratic revolution feels fresh and specific. The core concept is ingeniously executed through the sundial's coded angles. A minor deduction as the "calmly inventive" trait feels slightly ornamental, but the overall conception is highly original and well-integrated.</comment>
