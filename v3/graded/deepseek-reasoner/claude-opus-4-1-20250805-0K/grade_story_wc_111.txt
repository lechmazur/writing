<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marta's characterization is deeply integrated with the premise; her "wisely pragmatic" approach is embodied in every action, from polishing marbles to lying to plants. Her internal contradiction is captured in the line "a expression both blooming and withering," showing a complex, earned weariness. The final choice to give away her newest marble is a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values with a visible cost, perfectly scaling to the story's length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story builds through patterned repetitions (marbles, polishing, lies) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Marta passes her method to the next generation. The cost is legible on the page when she feels her "own luck index shifting" after giving away the marble. Orientation is immediate, and the closure reweights the entire premise without exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The garden maze is not merely setting but a crucible that constrains and enables Marta's choices; her "practiced ease" moving through it demonstrates mastery. The "spiral of training wires" functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image by commemorating her victories. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her expertise and urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marta's agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from tending plants to confronting the Ministry inspector and finally mentoring a new gardener. The dominant stake (proving luck is mutable) tightens through each beat, culminating in a choice that forecloses her keeping the marble but opens a new path. The cost is felt in her relinquishment of a precious object.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of "beautiful lies" transforming reality emerges organically from the cracked marbles and defiant blooms, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the young woman accepting the marble, reweighting the concept of truth and deception. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like the plants leaning into Marta's touch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Marta's perception; her voice is distinct and consistent, with a rhythmic control that mirrors the garden's growth. The prose has a distinct texture, e.g., "a sound like laughter, like grief, like growth." Any elision (e.g., the exact nature of "mended deceptions") is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and zero scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is precise and purposeful, e.g., "fruit ripening toward rot." Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the pace of Marta's movements and reflections. Read-aloud rhythm is flawless, accelerating and breathing with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The core premise of "mended deceptions" is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of magic realism and psychological insight. The combination of a luck index, cracked marbles, and a vine dresser feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, fully committing to its singular vision.</comment>
