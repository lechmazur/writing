<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and consistent, rooted in a specific professional curiosity that intensifies under pressure. Her interiority is concrete and character-particular, though her emotional state is more often described than fully embodied. The final choice to resurrect the system is earned by her prior efforts, though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the terminal's reactivation reconfigures Maya's understanding of engineering and hope. Causality is tight, with the sextant piece providing the key constant. The cost is legible in the final image of her sitting in the fountain, surrounded by the proof of her success and the weight of the discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is exceptionally well-integrated, functioning as the story's central character and primary constraint. The abandoned spaceport terminal is not a backdrop but the very mechanism of the plot, its pipes and channels dictating Maya's actions and ultimately charging the final, triumphant image of the erupting fountain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a density increase of understanding and pattern recognition. Maya's agency is clear as she redirects flows and opens valves, with each action narrowing her path toward the climax. The stakes transform from solving an equation to resurrecting a machine for hope, a meaningful deepening with a clear cost of effort and realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of hope engineered into infrastructure emerges organically from the specific events and the terminal's resurrection. It avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of water tracing celestial mathematics. The concept is fully integrated, proving that aspiration can be given physical form.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a perceptive, analytical quality that fits the protagonist. The prose has a controlled, purposeful rhythm. A slight register drift occurs in phrases like "functionally creative genius," which feels more like a label than part of the character's internal lexicon, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with a strong rhythmic cadence that supports the wonder of the discovery. Information density is high, with sentences often serving multiple functions. Minor issues include a slight over-reliance on compound sentences and the label-like quality of "functionally creative," but these do not harm clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The story's synthesis of hard engineering concepts with a lyrical, metaphysical theme is highly original and executed with confidence. The core premise—a building as a celestial calculator—is a fresh, non-obvious angle that feels inevitable in hindsight. The commitment to the concept is total, resulting in a singular and memorable piece.</comment>
