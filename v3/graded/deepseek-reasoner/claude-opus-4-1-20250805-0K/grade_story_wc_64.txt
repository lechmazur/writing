<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marta's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her gardening precision and quilt-making background informing her approach to decoding the tapestry. Her emotional progression from ritualistic time-keeping to timeless understanding feels earned through concrete micro-choices. The final decision to plant the tapestry demonstrates a hierarchy of values with visible cost, though the transition could be slightly more dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, with pattern recognition and density increase driving toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost in Marta's decision to plant the fragment, reconfiguring her relationship with time and tending. The sovereign case's discovery and decoding process create coherent linkage, though the initial unearthing feels slightly convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory specificity with the cobalt silo, starlight on shears, and velvet gloom creating a fully embodied atmosphere. The silo functions as both setting and character, constraining choice through its shadow and echoes. Professional details of gardening are woven organically into action rather than exposition. Sensory hierarchy reflects Marta's expertise throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes evolve beautifully from ritual maintenance to ontological discovery. Escalation occurs through the decoding process which narrows options and deepens understanding. Agency remains with Marta's careful untangling, though the initial discovery relies slightly on fortune. Cost is legible in her abandonment of the clock ritual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tapestry's revelations and Marta's corresponding realizations. The concept of "grief transformed into devotion" is earned through specific examples rather than abstraction. Final image of graves as "planted intentions" provides resonant, non-literal resolution without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the silent communication with the dead.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with horticultural metaphor woven throughout the narration. POV remains strictly bound to Marta's consciousness with consistent filtering. Syntax modulates effectively between precise gardening actions and lyrical revelations. Minor overwriting in phrases like "velveteen gloom" slightly interrupts flow but remains voice-consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Generally exquisite line-level craft with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include slight synonym churn ("uncharted echoes"/"reweave") and one mixed metaphor ("hollow throat" of silo). Propulsion remains strong throughout, and closure image lands with clarity. Read-aloud test reveals mostly natural cadences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of cemetery gardening, textile artistry, and metaphysical exploration. The concept of memory encoded in matter feels fresh and specific to this execution. Risk-taking in quiet, accumulative structure pays off with resonant closure. Transformation of familiar grief narrative through unique professional lens.</comment>
