<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in her role as a dedicated archivist, intensifying through her obsession with the shadow's migration. Her interiority is concrete and particular, embodied in her emotional response to the revelation ("eyes filled with tears that caught the library's prismatic light"). The final choice to preserve shadows is earned by the causality of her grandmother's hidden dream and her own thirty years of work. A minor deduction for the underdeveloped pressure from her colleagues, who exist only as a dismissed obstacle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira's understanding is reconfigured, charging her new purpose with the cost of her grandmother's long wait. The inferred Hybrid lens (Causal investigation leading to Accumulative revelation) holds strongly. The cost is legible in the "luminous regret" she feels and the weight of her new duty. The shadow's independent movement is a slight causality question, but its rule is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The blooming library is not just a vivid setting but a crucial object that constrains choice—Mira activates its interface to sync the timelines, directly causing the shadow's metamorphosis. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's professional expertise ("glass petals," "bio-glass membranes"). The library's environment actively charges the final image, its light refracting as she understands her new purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation under the Hybrid lens is driven by Mira's agency in comparing footage and activating the interface, which forces the shadow's transformation and the story's climax. The dominant stake (uncovering the truth) tightens meaningfully with this action. The cost is the emotional weight of the revealed generational sacrifice. The pressure coheres perfectly, narrowing options to a single, decisive understanding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of hope's patient preservation emerges organically from the specific events of the shadow's journey and the river stone's constancy. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the stone casting its "own small shadow," reweighting the entire narrative as a testament to endurance. Subtext operates powerfully in the shadow's actions, collecting moments of hope. No moralizing or thematic echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mira's perceptive, analytical voice. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture ("softly deliberate grace," "perpetual sunset") that modulates with emotional intensity. The elision of how dream-sharing technology works is purposeful and taught, trusting the reader to focus on the emotional core. A minor register drift in "luminous regret" feels slightly elevated but is motivated by the peak emotional beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, efficient imagery. However, a subtle paraphrase loop occurs around "softly deliberate" (used for the shadow's progression and the figure's grace), slightly dulling precision. Information density is otherwise excellent, and the closure image is crystal clear. No other artifacts or scaffold issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The core premise synthesizes a unique, non-obvious concept—a shadow as a vessel for unshared dreams—with profound emotional specificity. The combination of a far-future library, archival footage, and a simple river stone feels organic and inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its vision, following the implications of its premise to a powerful and authentic conclusion. A truly singular artistic stance.</comment>
