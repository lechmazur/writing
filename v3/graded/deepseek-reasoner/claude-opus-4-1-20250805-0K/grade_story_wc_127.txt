<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent, specific profession. Her internal conflict—the pull to subsume the emotions versus her cardinal rule—is dramatized in a single, potent moment, though the phrasing "affectionate detachment" leans slightly toward telling. Her final choice to endure her role is earned and carries the cost of her own emotional isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held perfectly. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Vera chooses her professional endurance, foreclosing the path of personal fulfillment with a felt cost. The grotto's transformation provides a coherent, escalating pressure that culminates in her decisive choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The amber grotto is indispensable, not merely described but actively pressuring the entire narrative. Its physical properties (transformation at dusk, static charge) directly constrain Vera's actions and enable the harvest. Sensory details are vivid, selective, and fully filtered through her professional expertise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled (harvesting under a time constraint) and escalate through the grotto's transformation, which narrows Vera's window for action. The internal conflict—her desire to consume the emotions—provides a meaningful tightening of pressure, though the external threat of the grotto sealing is a softer, situational escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of merciful incompletion is masterfully integrated, emerging entirely from the core concept and Vera's final realization. The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire story without moralizing. The concept of "half-truths" is explored with profound complexity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized through a distinct perceptual signature—clinical, precise, yet charged with latent empathy. The voice is consistently professional ("professionally thorough," "cardinal rule") yet modulates under pressure. Diction and syntax are controlled and purposeful, perfectly reflecting her occupation and internal state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("pools of liquid gold," "magnets seeking their opposite poles") is precise, coherent, and advances character and concept. No loops, scaffolding, or artifacts were detected. The final line is a powerful, resonant image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise of harvesting "half-truths" is brilliantly original and executed with conceptual integrity. The combination of a unique profession, a magical-realist setting, and a profound thematic exploration feels organic and inevitable. Every detail serves the singular artistic stance, resulting in a memorable and authentic vision.</comment>
