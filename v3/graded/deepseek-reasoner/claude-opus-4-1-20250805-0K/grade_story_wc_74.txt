<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is strong, with embodied insomnia and a credible artistic struggle. Her final choice to paint and share is motivated by specific memories of kindness. The trait "methodically hopeful" is more told than shown in a key choice, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens fits best. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the community gathers, reconfiguring isolation into connection. The cost of lost sleep is the price paid for this bridge, felt in the final image. The daydream trigger is slightly soft but does not break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse and smog are brilliantly integrated, constraining choice (her clean-air refuge) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's artistic POV. The moon-tipped brush functions as a key micro-setting object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift from personal memory to communal sharing, reweighting the stake of connection. The cost is her insomnia, traded for artistic breakthrough. Agency is clear in her choice to paint and post the work, catalyzing the gathering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the specific particulars of the brush, the painting, and the community response. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about kindness as a universal language. Avoids moralizing; the final image of the "saffron quiet" is powerfully thematic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional control of a distinct, lyrical narrative voice that remains consistent under pressure. The prose is characterized by a poetic but precise perceptual signature ("saffron-tinted smog hung like gauze"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mira's consciousness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("moonlight pooled on her workspace"). No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts were detected. A single minor synonym pair ("cramped and dim") prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of insomnia, lost languages, and urban alienation feels fresh and specific. The moon-tipped brush is an original and indispensable object. The concept is transformed through grounded, emotional particulars rather than remaining abstract. The ending's communal focus distinguishes it from a purely personal epiphany.</comment>
