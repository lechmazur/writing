<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific, credible professional identity. Her micro-choices under the time pressure are consistent and reveal her values. However, the trait "tranquilly perceptive" is stated rather than fully dramatized through embodied contradiction under stress, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, building pressure through sensory density and the ticking clock of the blackout. Closure is a resonant Charged Poise, crystallizing Mira's commitment to her role. The final image of the algae's eternal pulse reconfigures the stakes with a clear, felt cost of ongoing vigilance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The submerged library is not just a backdrop but a vital constraint that dictates Mira's methods and tools. The phosphorescent algae and the antique stamp are irreplaceable elements that charge the final image and are integral to the plot's mechanics and thematic resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is masterfully driven by the dwindling blackout, a coherent external pressure that forces Mira to work with methodical urgency. The stakes of preserving truth are made visceral through the immediacy of the failing systems. A minor deduction as the pressure, while palpable, could have been slightly more personalized to Mira's internal state.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between authentic and forged history, and the value of patient, analog truth-seeking in a digital age. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this central question without moralizing. The concept of "reclaimed stillness" is perfectly integrated as the necessary condition for this work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mira's professional, perceptive consciousness. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with the urgency of the task. A very minor instance of potentially thesaurus-driven word choice ("tranquilly") prevents a score above 9.0.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted, with a controlled, rhythmic cadence that mirrors the quiet urgency of the task. Information density is high, with sentences performing multiple duties of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. A single, minor metaphor ("dappled resolve") feels slightly ornamental rather than fully earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The core premise of a submerged library and a page indexer who "listens" to books is strikingly original and fully committed to. The synthesis of a post-apocalyptic setting with a quiet, philosophical conflict feels fresh and inevitable. The conceit is executed with remarkable specificity and conceptual integrity.</comment>
