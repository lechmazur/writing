<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elsa's reticence and comfort with isolation are consistently embodied and culminate in her final choice to tend the light, which feels earned. However, her motivation to "protect" is slightly told ("she understood then why she'd been chosen") rather than fully dramatized through a contradictory micro-choice under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elsa's acceptance of her role reconfigures the lighthouse's purpose and the ghosts' anguish. The cost is legible in the ghosts' tears and the weight of her new duty. The stone-message pattern is taught early and pays off decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated, with the sea glass and stone cairns constraining choice and charging the final image. The lantern room as a micro-setting applies crucial pressure. Minor deduction for some decorative details (e.g., "star-scattered sky") that don't directly constrain action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate cleanly from curiosity to supernatural dread to a charged offer of guardianship. Elsa's agency in choosing to tend the light is the decisive turn, foreclosing her old life with a visible cost (the ghosts' relief confirms the weight of her new duty). The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme of isolation transformed into purpose is masterfully integrated through concrete particulars (stones, letters, sea glass) and culminates in a resonant, non-literal answer. The final image of stacking stones offers a profound thematic resolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a perceptive, lyrical quality that modulates perfectly with the eerie atmosphere. POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elsa's sensory experience. The prose rhythm supports the accumulative, textured drive of the narrative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm, vivid imagery, and excellent information density. A single minor artifact: "its dead eye a wound in the star-scattered sky" employs a slightly conventional metaphor. Otherwise, line-level craft is exceptional and supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghost story with a meditation on isolation feels fresh and inevitable. The specific, grounded use of stone cairns and sea glass as communication systems transforms familiar tropes. The ending's emotional and conceptual risk-taking pays off with high coherence.</comment>
