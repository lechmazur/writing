<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is deeply rooted in embodied memory and a clear, escalating desire to reawaken beauty. Her final choice to play on despite the cost is earned by weeks of prior mapping and a tangible connection to the locust shell. The cost is felt in the approaching enforcement, charging her endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural drive lens is established and held, with pressure escalating through the density and resonance of Lira's music. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the orchard awakens and enforcement approaches, with cost made legible in the final, suspended moment of playing. The linkage is impeccable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and integral to the conflict, with the sky-bridge and mechanized orchard applying constant pressure. While the locust shell and violin charge the final image, no single environmental element concretely constrains a choice, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate beautifully under the Accumulative lens through the intensifying resonance of the music and the awakening of the orchard. Lira's agency is the direct driver of this escalation, and the cost of the approaching enforcement is a palpable, complicating pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core conflict and is crystallized in the superb final image of playing oneself empty to become a shell for another's freedom. It is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that remains controlled and consistent under peak pressure. The voice is perfectly calibrated to the POV, with purposeful elision (e.g., the Council's specifics) that serves the story's mythic quality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion. A minor deduction for the slightly thematic phrase "tarnished wonder," which feels like a label, though it is quickly redeemed by the concrete image of fire in the strings.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of industrial and magical decay feels wholly original and inevitable. The core concept of "signaling through heart rhythms" is a specific, ingenious mechanic that is indispensable to the plot and thematically rich. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
