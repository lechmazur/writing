<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique gift and the amber heirloom. Her internal conflict is embodied through the tactile use of her tools and the amber's warmth, and her final act of tethering digital ghosts is a high-stakes choice earned by prior causality. The micro-choice to use the amber as a lens reveals her values and incurs the visible cost of its fracture. A hairline slip: her ability to translate baby cries, while established, is not directly leveraged in the on-page action, making it a minor tell-not-shown element.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds firmly from summoning to resolution. Closure is a decisive change (the firmware is quieted, memorialized) with clear, felt cost (the amber cracks, the message appears). The constraint of the temporal fold and the haunted firmware shapes all tactics. The final image of the pulsing constellation is a resonant, on-page proof of cost and change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is a micro-setting that actively pressures the action by amplifying the haunted frequencies. The amber pendant and tattooing tools function as objects-as-setting, constraining choice and decisively charging the final image with its fracture. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's professional perception (e.g., "needles that could etch light, ink distilled from meteorite dust").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens: she diagnoses the cry, chooses to use the amber, and performs the tethering. The stakes—to silence the accumulated guilt of deleted code—are signaled early and tighten through her irreversible, costly action. The cost is unmistakable on the page in the cracking amber and the final, silent resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The theme of giving form to forgotten guilt emerges organically from the core concept and Mara's specific action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the memorial constellation, reweighting the premise without moralizing. The transformation of dissonance into a lullaby is a profound and earned conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends the scientific ("subsonic guilt") and the mythic ("meteor hush"). The prose's rhythmic control is exceptional under pressure, with purposeful elision (e.g., "Hours passed, or perhaps years") that serves the theme. A single, minor instance of elevated diction ("resolved dissonance") slightly clashes with the POV's otherwise concrete lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense, precise, and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off (e.g., "meteor hush"). Sentence-level rhythm modulates perfectly with scene needs, from the initial static to the final quiet. The final line is a masterful image that resolves and recharges the premise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>A stunningly original synthesis of cosmic and digital hauntology, grounded in the deeply specific, tactile profession of constellation tattooing. The core concept of haunted firmware is transformed through lived detail and a non-obvious moral calculus, feeling inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking—blending time folds, amber, and code—heightens stakes and coherence without a hint of gimmickry.</comment>
