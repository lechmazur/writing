<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The curator's bewildered but logical response to temporal vertigo feels earned, particularly her retreat to the bathroom to "unfold" her mind. Her final choice to accept the paradox is motivated by a clear, embodied realization, and her micro-choices under pressure reveal a consistent hierarchy of values. The emotional progression from confusion to "terrible joy" is credible and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing that redefines the museum's purpose with undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred Hybrid lens (dominantly Accumulative/Textural) holds, with pressure escalating through accumulating paradoxes and imagery density. The cost is legible in the final image of the apple's "liquid starlight," which crystallizes the price of forbidden knowledge. Orientation is deliberately delayed but taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The astral orchard is indispensable, constraining choice by its impossible physics and charging the final image with its quantum-blossoming trees. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into the POV's perception and the story's thematic logic. The bathroom micro-setting functions as a crucial crucible for revelation. The setting evolves causally with the protagonist's understanding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, as her inquiry leads to a philosophical breakthrough that reweights the dominant stake of forbidden knowledge. The cost is unmistakable in the final beat, with the "terrible joy" of understanding and the tangible, paradoxical taste of the apple. A single, profound deepening is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of nonlinear inheritance is fully integrated, emerging from concrete events and the charged reconfiguration of the pistachio shell. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of the apple, reweighting all prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in implication, such as the bathroom's function as a liminal space for revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that filters the bizarre through a curator's logical lens. The prose has a controlled, lyrical rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity without losing clarity. Purposeful elision (e.g., the other self's disappearance) is taught and pays off. The single line of dialogue is natural and carries significant subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and heightens clarity, even in peak beats ("like liquid starlight"). Sentence-level propulsion and rhythmic control are masterful, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. The opening and closing lines perfectly anchor and resolve the voice.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cosmic setting with an intimate, philosophical premise is fresh, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of a museum that "collects from all times" is a non-obvious, brilliant transformation of a familiar trope. Bold risk-taking in the non-linear structure heightens stakes and coherence, fully committing to its implications without retreat.</comment>
