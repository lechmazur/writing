<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is exceptional, with her transposed empathy rendered through concrete, embodied experience ("grief multiplied by infinity, divided by the square root of abandonment"). Her final realization—that emotion is typography—is earned through the scene's accumulative pressure. A minor deduction for a slight over-articulation of the "mathematics of emotion" concept mid-scene, which borders on diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the final realization that emotion is typography reweights the entire premise. The cost is legible in the line "Mira couldn't remember which personality was originally hers." The pattern of vanishing stars and accumulating personalities creates a coherent, escalating density that charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The topaz workshop and vanishing stars are indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and filtered through Mira's professional POV ("crystalline walls caught and refracted the diminishing starlight"). The setting is fully integrated into the narrative's causal and thematic logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the accumulative pressure of vanishing stars and overlapping personalities, narrowing Mira's options until her climactic realization. The dominant stake (preserving consciousness) tightens meaningfully, and the cost of her self-dissolution is felt on the page. The halo fragment's origin could be slightly more grounded to heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically from the confluence of celestial decay and typography, culminating in the profound, non-literal insight that "emotion wasn't mathematics at all. It was typography." Subtext operates powerfully in the printed messages and the final image of Mira smiling "with seventeen different mouths," resisting any tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The voice possesses a distinct, controlled perceptual signature, with syntax and rhythm reflecting Mira's analytical yet ecstatic state. Purposeful elision (e.g., the client's exact nature) is taught early and pays off. A minor register drift occurs in the "mathematics of emotion" passage, but it's brief and does not disrupt the overall voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor instance of repetitive conceptual scaffolding in the paragraph describing the "mathematics of emotion," which slightly dulls momentum. However, the closure beat is flawlessly executed, with no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of letterpress printing, celestial decay, and transposed empathy is wholly original, inevitable in hindsight, and executed with conceptual integrity. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded detail and a non-obvious moral calculus, resulting in a singular and memorable artistic stance.</comment>
