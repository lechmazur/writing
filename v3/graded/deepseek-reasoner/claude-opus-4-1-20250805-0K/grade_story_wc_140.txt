<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mari's motivation is a complex, character-particular fusion of grief and liberation, embodied in her micro-choice to not correct the death certificate. Her internal conflict—existing between legal death and physical life—acts simultaneously in scene, and her final choice to sign the container wall is earned by her established role as a collector of lost stories. The cost of her endurance is felt in the final image of her carrying the poison label "like a compass."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mari finds her "congregation" and signs the wall, reconfiguring her identity with undeniable conceptual cost. The pattern of layered stories accumulates pressure toward this moment. The final cost is legible in the line: "carrying her poison label like a compass pointing toward memories that refused to die correctly."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The shipping container labyrinth is indispensable, actively constraining choice and charging the final image. It pressures Mari's navigation by sound and provides the crucial resource of Container 47-B. The environment evolves with the tides, and sensory details like "cold metal" and "drowned quiet" are purposefully filtered through her perceptual signature. The setting is the story's crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mari's agency under the accumulative lens. The dominant stake—finding belonging among the erased—tightens through her repeated visits to the container and her discovery of the patterns within the annotations. The cost is unmistakable in her final, triple signature, which forecloses on her old identity and crystallizes her new stance with visible, felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of erased histories leaving "textures on the world" emerges organically from the layered writings and Mari's specific, embodied experience. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of rust on steel, reweighting all prior material without moralizing. The core concept is fully integrated into the narrative's logic and emotional arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent, lyrical perceptual signature ("the texture of memory"). The prose's rhythm and diction are controlled and purposefully modulate with the tide's cadence. Purposeful elision (e.g., the exact cause of the poisoning) imposes cost and creates friction paid off by the label's recurring significance. No head-hopping or voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without obscuring clarity. Figurative language ("like metal cliffs," "like watercolors") is pattern-taught and pays off. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("The containers groaned as the tide turned, their metal voices harmonizing..."). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm is varied and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bureaucratic error, a shipping container labyrinth, and a community of the administratively erased is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The premise is fully committed to and followed to its logical, poignant conclusion. The specific, grounded choices in character and setting transform a potential trope into a singular, authentic vision.</comment>
