<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyra's prosopagnosia is a profound and consistent trait that dictates her unique perception and artistic method. Her final choice to craft with light is a direct, earned transcendence of her perceived limitation, rooted in her tactile understanding of the world. The cost is felt in the quiet sacrifice of the library and the weight of memory she now carries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens dominates, with pressure escalating through the increasing density of discovered meaning and the impending deadline. Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing in the final, living light portrait and the gift of the coin, which carries the undeniable conceptual cost of preservation amidst destruction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is not merely described but is the central crucible that constrains and enables Lyra's final act. Its physicality—the carved shelves, the hollow interior, the gaps for light—is integral to the plot's resolution. The setting actively charges the final image, making its loss palpable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear from the first line: preservation against impending demolition. Escalation is driven by Lyra's agency in discovering the coin and choosing her method, which deepens the conceptual stakes from saving a place to saving a continuum. The cost is the library's physical loss, made legible in the silent dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of perceiving essence beyond surface is intricately woven through the core concept, character flaw, and central action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: that true sight is tactile and memorial, "between touching and knowing." It avoids moralizing, achieving its power through concrete image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture that perfectly mirrors the story's themes of perception and memory. The POV is steadfastly anchored in Lyra's sensorium, with a perceptual signature biased toward touch and sound. The voice remains coherent and elevated without register drift, even under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional. Sentences are propulsive and dense, doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. There is no scaffolding or looped phrasing; figurative language is precise and purposeful ("condemned cathedral of knowledge"). Rhythm and syntax masterfully control the story's pacing and heightened tone.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of prosopagnosia, a doomed library, and a tactile artist is brilliantly original and feels inevitable. The choice to have her craft a portrait not of a person but of the space itself is a profound and fresh inflection. The story fully commits to its high-concept premise, executing it with emotional authenticity and conceptual integrity.</comment>
