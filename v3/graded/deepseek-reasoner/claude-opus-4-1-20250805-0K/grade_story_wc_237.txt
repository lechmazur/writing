<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Kira's characterization is exceptional, with her crystalline condition serving as both flaw and strength. Her internal conflict is vividly embodied, and her final choice to trace her own scars is earned by prior causality. The micro-choice to count her crystals under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final renunciation of shame feels inevitable and deeply personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kira's self-acceptance reconfigures her relationship with her condition. The accumulative/textural lens holds, with pressure building through sensory detail and internal reflection until the decisive act of drawing. Cost is legible in the shedding of crystals and the pulsing rune. The ending image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered and purposeful, with the "breath between storms" atmosphere mirroring Kira's internal state. The crow quill and crystallizing skin function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. The floating platform is less actively pressured, serving more as atmospheric staging, which prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Kira's agency under the accumulative lens, with the pressure of the test and her held breath forcing a stance crystallization. The dominant stake (self-acceptance) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully. The cost is unmistakable in the physical shedding of crystals and the emotional release of shame.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of transforming scars into stories is masterfully integrated, emerging from concrete action and image rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the superstition and scholarship dichotomy. The final image of the pulsing rune serves as a profound Conceptual Repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, lyrical texture with a controlled rhythm that modulates perfectly with emotional intensity. The perceptual signature is strong, filtered through Kira's stress and realization. POV is stable and deep, with purposeful elision (the held breath) that pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exemplary. Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("liquid starlight," "geography of her stress-born scars") is precise and enhances clarity. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with tension and breathing at resolution. A single minor deduction for a slightly stacked modifier ("saturated hush").</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a magical examination with a physiological condition feels fresh and organic. The transformation of the childhood rhyme into a key to self-knowledge is a specific, non-obvious turn that feels inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its premise, avoiding safety hedging. The risk-taking with a quiet, internal climax heightens meaning.</comment>
