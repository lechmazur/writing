<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, rooted in a specific gift and a desire to combat historical indifference. Her "carefully resourceful" trait is demonstrated through on-page actions like collecting fragments and reading the star-map, though her internal contradiction could be more vividly embodied in the peak moment. The final choice to upload the documents is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A strong Causal drive lens holds throughout, with clear because/therefore linkages: because the Ministry is striking, Mira must act on her discovered map. Closure is a decisive change (uploading evidence) with a visible cost (the arrested leaders serving as a distraction). The final image of the key catching the sun reconfigures the stakes with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The auric lagoon and hidden tunnel are vividly rendered and purposefully integrated into the action, with the lagoon serving as the crucial mechanism for the map. However, the environment primarily enables the plot rather than actively constraining Mira's choices under pressure, preventing a higher score. The setting's sensory details are selective and reflect the POV's urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: the imminent Ministry strike forces Mira's hand, narrowing her options and compelling her to use the key and map immediately. The cost is legible on the page in the sacrifice of the resistance leaders, which provides the necessary distraction for her success.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between erased history and recovered truth, resisting moralizing. The final image of the key offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of fighting indifference. The concept of "freedom coded in the spaces between official stories" is a powerful and earned thematic summation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, controlled texture. The narrative voice effectively filters the world through Mira's perceptive and determined perspective. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. A slight tendency toward elevated diction in peak beats ("tyranny of indifference") prevents a higher score, though it remains largely voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("another revised history, another convenient lie") and a slightly over-written description of the lagoon waters, which slightly dulls immediacy at the opening. The sentence-level rhythm is strong and supports the scene's urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of a dystopian revisionist history with a unique, magic-realist mechanic (reading reflected light) feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully committed to and followed through to its logical conclusion, transforming familiar tropes through specific, grounded choices in character and world-building.</comment>
