<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Morrow's methodical nature and deep-seated motivation to understand her mentor's work are clear and consistent, compelling her high-stakes choice to activate the mosaic. Her emotional progression from careful search to blooming understanding is embodied and credible, avoiding diagnostic speech. The final choice to leave the eyes and return is an earned endurance that forecloses a simpler path with a visible cost of continued, solitary study.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pressure building through the density of sensory and conceptual patterns until the final image reconfigures the meaning of loss. Closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing, landing on the page with undeniable cost in the final paragraph's realization that "absence, properly calculated, was just another form of presence." The orientation is immediate and the taught pattern pays off flawlessly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is indispensable, actively pressuring the experiment with its silence and nourishing the trees that "hum at a frequency below hearing." The mosaic stepping stone is a micro-setting that constrains the pivotal choice, and the dripping stalactites are a live element that ceases to create the necessary conditions for the work. Every detail is purposeful, filtered through Morrow's perception, and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification through pattern density, culminating in the bioluminescent revelation. The dominant stake of understanding loss is signaled early and meaningfully deepens, reweighted by the protagonist's agency in placing the eyes. The cost is legible in her acceptance of Elias's transformed state and her commitment to continue learning this "ancient arithmetic."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of emotional mathematics transforming loss into a form of presence is fully integrated, emerging organically from the concrete particulars of the mosaic, the eyes, and the orchard's ecology. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing, reweighting all prior material. The concept avoids tidy binaries, embracing a complex, ambiguous calculus felt through the final image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose possesses a distinct, controlled texture with a perceptive signature that blends the mystical and the analytical, perfectly suited to the conjurer's POV. The elision of Elias's dialogue into the "geometric language of glowing fungal threads" is a taught, purposeful pattern that pays off at closure. The voice remains coherent and specific under pressure, with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control that accelerates with the revelation. There is no scaffolding, synonym churn, or figurative muddle. A single minor instance of slightly abstract phrasing ("buried optimism") is quickly grounded in the concrete verb "bloom." The prose is lucid and propulsive throughout, especially in the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of taxidermy, mathematics, and emotion is strikingly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is committed to fully and transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. The risk of a non-physical, mathematical resolution is bold but succeeds completely, heightening stakes and coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
