<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elena's meticulous storm-recording is deeply embodied through concrete micro-choices (unwinding clasps, calibrating instruments). Her final decision to continue her work as an act of resistance is earned by prior causality and reveals a clear hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inferred Causal lens holds tightly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where her commitment to recording becomes an act of revolution. The cost is legible in the final image of her calibrating instruments by lamplight, building an "unbreakable" record.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The courtyard and her instruments function as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables her choices. The anemometer and journal are not just described but are handled and charged with meaning, directly shaping the final, resonant image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the revelation of the second message, which recontextualizes her life's work and narrows her options. The cost is the foreclosing of her former solitude and the assumption of a new, dangerous purpose, felt in her decisive reply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of truth as a form of resistance emerges organically from the fusion of scientific precision and political intrigue. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer, reweighting her meticulous data into a revolutionary act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elena's scientific, observant mind. The prose has a distinct, measured rhythm and perceptual signature that reflects her character, especially under pressure ("progressing laterally").</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and purposeful, with high information density and varied sentence structure. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph's rhythm masterfully supports the Charged Poise closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of meteorological science and dystopian resistance feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of a quarantine zone organizing and using weather data is a specific, non-obvious angle executed with high conceptual integrity.</comment>
