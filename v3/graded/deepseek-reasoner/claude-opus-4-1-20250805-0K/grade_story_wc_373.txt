<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mae's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal her values. The final endurance is earned by prior causality, with visible cost when she accepts she can never return. The watch fob functions as a crucible object that tests her allegiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds strongly with because/therefore linkages. Closure is a decisive change (the raid) with resonant reconfiguration (Mae's changed relationship to her heritage). Cost is legible in "its weight forever changed" and the echo of broken trust. Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered and constrains choice—the rotting pier, pirate market, and watch fob all pressure tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mae's POV. The environment charges the final image with the misty dissolution of the market.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thwarting the shipment) is signaled early and tightens under the causal lens. Escalation is driven by Mae's agency—her third approach using her bloodline—and costs her chance to return. The tide change deadline adds coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of trust and legacy emerges through events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "Some sounds were worth the breaking." Subtext operates in gestures like the woman studying the fob, and the final image reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature in phrases like "comfort felt like a wool blanket soaked in seawater." Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Compression is purposeful, and elision (e.g., the exact recording contents) serves closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied rhythm and sentence openings. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off (e.g., "recognition blooming like algae"). No loops or scaffold artifacts. Peak beats remain clear under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of pirate markets and federal infiltration feels organic. The watch fob as hidden badge is ingenious. Tropes are transformed through specific grounded choices. Minor deduction for familiar "infiltration plot" structure, but execution elevates it.</comment>
