<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marina's ghostly POV is consistent and her altruistic motivation is clear, though her internal conflict is necessarily limited by her spectral nature. Her micro-choices (writing messages) drive the plot, and her final fading is an earned renunciation with visible cost. The lack of deep interior contradiction is a minor limitation for a ghost character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong causal drive lens holds throughout. Closure is a decisive change (Marina's work complete, her fading) with clear cost (her disappearance). The plot progresses through because/therefore linkages from her messages to collective action. Orientation is immediate and clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating arches are vividly rendered and essential to the story's logic. The setting actively pressures choices (the blight, the isolated groves) and the bell object charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Marina's perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community survival) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by Marina's agency (writing messages) which forces a meaningful tightening (families reexamining assumptions). The cost of collective effort is legible in the hard work described, and the resolution is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of community vs. isolation emerges organically from events and images (the blight, the fences, the shared fountain). The final message offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the story's premise. Avoids moralizing, trusting the reader to infer meaning from the specific, earned outcome.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV (Marina) is stable and effective. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture appropriate to the spectral narrator. The few lines of dialogue are natural and functional. Minor deduction for a slight convergence in narrative voice when describing other characters' reactions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished, vivid, and highly efficient, with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. No noticeable loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. A model of concise, purposeful writing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a ghost story with an ecological parable feels fresh and organic. The core concept is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The resolution feels inevitable in hindsight. A slight familiarity in the "community heals itself" arc prevents a higher score.</comment>
