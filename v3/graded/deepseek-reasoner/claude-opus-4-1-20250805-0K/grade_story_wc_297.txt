<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s "root-bound" nature is a consistent, embodied trait that motivates her unique perception and culminates in a credible, earned role as the anchor. Her purposefully curious stance drives micro-choices, like tracing scars, under pressure. A minor deduction for the future-self whisper, which feels slightly declarative but is quickly anchored in concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens fits best, with pressure escalating through density of pattern and sensory detail. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira accepts her role, landing with clear cost: the glade’s "anxious elation" and her final smile are legible, felt prices for this new, weighty understanding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The cobalt glade is indispensable, its blue grass and scars actively constraining Mira’s choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully woven into action, such as the topiary’s roots weaving into the earth. The setting is a dynamic participant, not a backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification via pattern density—the maze’s growth and scar revelation reweight the dominant stake of understanding the covenant. Mira’s agency is clear in her active tracing and reaching, driving the escalation toward the charged closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of root-bound identity, scars, and time, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: "roots and wings finally, impossibly, the same thing." The eclipsed covenant concept is fully integrated into the narrative’s logic and emotional resolution without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply embodied, with a distinct perceptual signature filtering the world through Mira’s curious, tactile sensibility. The prose’s rhythmic control is strong, though a slight tendency toward lushness in peak beats (e.g., "dreams made manifest hung like fruit") prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but occasional overwriting risks muddle, such as "anxious elation thrumming through her veins like electricity through water." The sentence-level propulsion is generally strong, though some metaphors slightly strain for effect without harming closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of time folds, a root-bound protagonist, and an eclipsed covenant is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept is committed to fully and transformed through specific, grounded particulars in character and setting, avoiding template plots or derivative premises.</comment>
