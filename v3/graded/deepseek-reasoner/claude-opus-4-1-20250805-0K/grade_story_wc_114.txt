<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is exceptional, with her fault-tolerance and peripherally aware nature driving every choice. Her final act of smudging her signature is a micro-choice that reveals her hierarchy of values with visible cost. Embodied emotion is precise, like "truth rushed through her like altitude sickness," avoiding diagnostic speak. The only minor flaw is a slight over-reliance on conceptual labels in peak beats, but her contradictory impulses act in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a powerful Conceptual Repricing under the Accumulative/Textural lens, reweighting the premise of truth itself. The cost is legible in the final image of her carrying the truth "like a second, wiser heart." The drive lens holds perfectly from the early "swaying certainties" to the charged poise of the ending. No causality breaks; the illustration's discovery motivates all subsequent actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The aurora's descent is a breathtaking environmental pressure that forces the climax. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and filtered through Mira's professional POV, like instruments recording "only what they were designed to measure." The station hums as a character itself, perfectly integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, with the stake of finding "the weight of a swallowed truth" tightening through her marginal occupation. The cost is unmistakable in her solitude and the electromagnetic sorrow of the aurora. One meaningful deepening—the aurora's intimate descent—reweights all prior knowledge with profound cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from the central contradiction of "swaying certainties," resisting tidy resolution. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of flowers thriving in impossibility. Subtext operates in every gesture, especially the smudged signature protecting truth. No moralizing; the conceptual repricing is earned through specific struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature that blends scientific precision and poetic insight. Syntax reflects Mira's fault-tolerant mind, holding contradictions without breaking. Purposeful compression ("delirium of false readings") is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV stability is absolute.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. However, minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats ("like grief made visible," "like altitude sickness"), causing slight register drift. No loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances the story. The closure image remains clear and powerful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Originality is exceptional, synthesizing oracle gifts with meteorological science into a singular vision. The core concept of fault-tolerant truth is transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in the lyric-scientific voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The integration feels inevitable and entirely fresh.</comment>
