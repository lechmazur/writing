<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with her hearing loss filtering her perception through vibration and thermal imagery. Her motivation to "rectify what the silence had stolen" drives the entire narrative, culminating in an earned Conceptual Repricing of her loss as a gain. A slight tendency toward diagnostic language ("emotional landscapes") in one beat prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is taught early and held perfectly, building pressure through the density of thermal patterns and Mira's observations. Closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, landing on the page with undeniable cost in the final image of her frozen tears. The persistent constraint of her deafness shapes every tactic and the final, resonant realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is an indispensable, pressure-filled environment that constrains and enables Mira's discovery at every turn. The setting is filtered through her unique perception, with sensory details like the "hummed" heating frequency and "pulsing" frost patterns being wholly integrated into the action and central conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the Accumulative lens, as her systematic experimentation with the tuning forks deepens her understanding and the stakes. The cost is legible in the final paragraph's crystallized image of her frozen tears, a price paid for her night-long vigil and transformative discovery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The theme of finding music beyond sound emerges organically from the particulars of Mira's loss and the plants' responses. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of "organisms that had learned to sing in temperatures," reweighting the premise of loss without a hint of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The POV is stable and deeply filtered through Mira's acoustically-tuned perception, creating a distinct and consistent narrative voice. The prose rhythm masterfully modulates between lyrical description and precise scientific observation, with any elision (like the crewmates' fate) serving to charge the present moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and purposeful, vivid imagery. A very minor rhythmic repetition in a few consecutive sentences ("thermal symphony," "singing in wavelengths") prevents a higher score, though it does not obscure clarity or harm the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of Arctic botany, hearing loss, and thermal imaging is strikingly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of "unshaken marvels" is transformed through specific, grounded choices, committing fully to its implications and yielding a singular, authentic artistic stance.</comment>
