<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Marina's characterization is exceptionally layered, with her crisis actor backstory and historian motive creating palpable internal contradiction. Her micro-choices—refusing the summons to instead walk the names of the forgotten—embody a credible, costly endurance. The final stance ("W-E R-E-M-A-I-N") is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in her renunciation of official witnesshood.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the final image of walking the pawns' names reweights the entire premise, making absence the central, costly truth. The lens holds perfectly from the opening's patterned walking to the ending's resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate, and cost is legible in the final paragraph's "light through a wandering shadow."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is indispensable, acoustically shaping Marina's action and charging the final image. The chessboard constrains choice and meaning, its missing pawns becoming the story's central metaphor. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Marina's perceptual bias ("whispers traveled like ghosts of legislation").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by Marina's agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens: her refusal of the summons deepens the stakes, forcing a trade-off between official and personal witness. The cost is felt in her continued isolation and the luminous absence she documents. Pressure coheres and tightens through a single, meaningful cadence shift at the interruption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from the particulars of the chessboard and walking, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to history's erasure through the image of "walking words into the marble." Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and absence, particularly the pawns as metaphor for the unremembered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature that filters the world through Marina's historian lens. The prose rhythm is controlled and purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity. The single dialogue exchange is natural and goal-driven, carrying significant subtext in its refusal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without losing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("like generals surveying an empty battlefield"). Minor deduction for slight repetition of "walking" and "unbinding" concepts in the final paragraph, though it serves accumulative pattern.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of crisis actor, whispering gallery, and pawnless chessboard is wholly original and inevitable. The concept of documenting "small gestures" transforms a familiar post-traumatic arc into a singular, ingenious stance. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
