<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's interiority is concrete and embodied, with micro-choices under pressure revealing a clear hierarchy of values. The final unmasking is a credible endurance earned by prior causality, with scars mapping the cost. Minor deduction for a slight diagnostic feel in "strangely honest in her urgency."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through density and cadence shifts to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. The final image of the murmuring pavilion and dancing parapet reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is clear by ~100 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated and actively constrains choice—the kinetic parapet's movement and the pavilion's murmuring are essential to the climax. The environment charges the final image, with the pavilion's crystalline pillars and whispering fountain serving as a lived-in, tactile crucible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the consecration ritual serving as a decisive deepening that reweights the dominant stake. The cost is legible in the parapet's purposeful movement and the walkers' exhaustion. A single meaningful intensification is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the consecration of spaces and the preservation of memory, resisting moralizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of wisdom's echo, reweighting prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature filtering setting through a walker's expertise. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture. Minor deduction for a slight convergence in dialogue voices under pressure, though the internal voice remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and vivid sensory detail. Minor artifacts include a slight template cadence in "whisperfield calm deliberation" and a near-paraphrase loop between "vessels" and "repositories," but these do not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a living defensive wall, conjured clearings, and a half-masked boundary walker feels fresh and inevitable. The core premise is fully committed to and transformed through specific, grounded choices in world logic and moral calculus.</comment>
